Note â€” one journal, Current Directions in Psychological Science was initially classified as eligible and included in the generation of the random sample of articles for prominent journals.  However, we later decided to exclude this journal because it does not published empirical research. No articles from the journal appeared in the sample of prominent journal articles. In the prominent journal sample, we replace it with the "Journal of Counselling Psychology".
