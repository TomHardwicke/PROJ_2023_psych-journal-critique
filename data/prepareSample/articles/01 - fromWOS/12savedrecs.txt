Trends in Tobacco Use among Young Adults Presenting for Military Service in the United States Air Force between 2013 and 2018								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	3			370	376		10.1080/10826084.2020.1868517			DEC 28 2020	2020	Background: The US military has historically higher tobacco use compared to civilians, and tobacco use increases following enlistment. While the military is vulnerable to tobacco use, current surveillance of tobacco among this high-risk population is lacking. Methods: Recently enlisted Airmen (N = 43,597) between 2013 and 2018 were asked about tobacco use prior to enlistment across ten products: (1) cigarettes/roll your own tobacco, (2) smokeless tobacco/snus, (3) cigars, cigarillos/little cigars, (4) hookah/pipe, and (5) e-cigarettes. Results: Hookah/pipe use, cigarettes/roll your own, smokeless tobacco/snus, and cigars/little cigars/cigarillos use decreased significantly between 2013 and 2018, while the prevalence of e-cigarette use increased (p's < 0.0001). The relationships between the time and each tobacco product(s) use outcomes were influenced differently by different age, race, education and marital status. Conclusion: While e-cigarette use has increased in the civilian sector, the use of e-cigarettes among new recruits increased much more drastically (i.e. prevalence 15.3% in 2018). Further, demographic characteristics influenced tobacco trends; specifically, recruits of racial minorities increased their use of e-cigarettes over the past five years faster than Whites. Of concern is what impact this dramatic increase in e-cigarette use will have on overall health and later initiation of combustible tobacco products in the military.		[Little, Melissa A.; Talcott, G.

Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 43 children with asthma. The control group consisted of 37 healthy children. The exposure to tobacco smoke was assessed by the presence of the cotinine in the urine (metabolit of nicotine). Results: The group of children with asthma exposed to tobacco smoke had significantly higher levels of the IL-1 and lower levels IL-4 than children not exposed to the passive smoking. The children from the control group exposed to tobacco smoke had a significantly higher concentration of IL-4 than unexposed children. In the whole analyzed population, there was a significant positive correlation between cotinine-IL1 and cotinine-CRP. Conclusion: In this study we found that the passive exposure to tobacco smoke has the immunomodulatory effects on the immune system.

Methods: A convenience sample of young adults ages 21-28 (n = 29) were recruited online May-July 2020 to participate in semi-structured interviews about nicotine use behaviors specific to cigarillos and e-cigarettes. Audio-recorded interviews were 60-90 min long and were conducted remotely. Participants were asked opinions and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use. Verbatim transcripts and field notes from each interview were coded by a trained researcher using a codebook developed using inductive and deductive approaches. Thematic analysis was used to examine product access, use frequency, stress and use triggers. Results: Most current users reported tobacco use stayed the same or increased since the pandemic and attributed this to being home more with greater time/boredom. COVID-19 impacted purchasing behaviors such as purchasing products in greater quantities, through the Internet, or at a different store due to perceived cleanliness. Few reported using tobacco products less frequently and not smoking in public due to the perception of risks associated with smoking and COVID-19, plus having to take off their mask to smoke. Lack of social use modified shared product use, flavors selected, and setting of use. Financial impacts included increased product costs and job loss. Few mentioned wanting to quit due to the pandemic. Discussion: Current tobacco users have experienced major changes in their tobacco use routines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Eighty community based participants with subjective memory complaints Community-based study at UCLA were randomized to one of three conditions: Memory Training, the program consisted of weekly 120-minute classes featuring instruction in three specific strategies: Method of Loci; Chunking Technique; and Face-Name Association, Health Education or Wait-List over seven weeks. All participants underwent pre- and 1-week post-intervention follow-up memory testing for recalling word lists (in serial order and any order) and face-name pairs. Memory control beliefs were assessed at baseline and follow-up using the Memory Controllability Inventory, which consists of four subscales; Present Ability; Potential Improvement; Effort Utility; and Inevitable Decrement. Results: Sixty-three participants (mean age [SD] 68.3 [6.7] years) were included in the analysis. ANCOVA revealed significant group differences in the Present Ability subscale, F-2,F-58 = 4.93, p =.01. Participants in the Memory Training group significantly improved on the Present Ability subscale compared to the Health Education group (mean difference =.96, SE =.31, p =.003, effect size = 0.93). From regression analyses, baseline Memory Controllability Inventory subscales did not significantly predict memory performance after memory training. Conclusions: Baseline memory control beliefs did not predict memory performance following the intervention, but participating in memory training enhanced memory control beliefs about current memory function. These results suggest that participating in memory training can enhance confidence in one's memory ability.

Studies into pre-loading have been using different operational definitions and descriptions, leading to confusion and debate in the research literature. Purpose/Objective: We wish to propose a full taxonomy so that research into preloading, of any substances, can be specific and standardized. Methods: We address this problem by analyzing (1) terminology used throughout the literature, (2) the evolving nature of this phenomenon, and (3) the operational components comprising this substance use practice. Additionally, we provide a context and rationale for how we view pre-loading in relation to the broader event-level session. Results: Our results propose a full operational definition and taxonomy of pre-loading to be used, and built upon, by researchers. We also provide a visual representation of pre-loading within an event-level session and provide a method to facilitate consistency across cultures. Conclusions: We propose that this system will lead to greater specificity and higher reliability in the interpretation of research results.		[Hughes, Lee R.

Recent theoretical models suggest evolution favors intuitive cooperation, which raises questions on the behavioral but also neural timelines involved. We studied the outcome/feedback stage of iPD rounds with electroencephalography (EEG) methods. Results showed that neural signals associated with this stage also relate to future choice, in an outcome-dependent manner: (i) after zero-gain "sucker's payoffs" (unreciprocated cooperation), a participant's decision thereafter relates to changes to the feedback-related negativity (FRN); (ii) after one-sided non-cooperation (participant wins at co-player's expense), by the P3; (iii) after mutual cooperation, by late frontal delta-band modulations. Critically, faster reciprocation behavior towards a co-player's choice to cooperate was predicted, on a single-trial basis, by players' P3 and frontal delta modulations at the immediately preceding trial. Delta-band signaling is discussed in relation to homeostatic regulation processing in the literature. The findings relate the early outcome/feedback stage to subsequent decisional processes in the iPD, providing a first neural account of the brief timelines implied in heuristic modes of cooperation.

Parents' Cannabis-Related Attitudes and Emerging Adult Offspring Cannabis Use: Testing the Mediating Effect of Perceived Parental Approval								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	2			308	317		10.1080/10826084.2020.1868004			DEC 25 2020	2020	Background: Contrary to parental alcohol use and expectancies work, little is known about how parent's cannabis use (CU) and expectancies influence offspring CU. This is a notable gap in the literature given increasing acceptability and use of cannabis, especially among emerging adults (EA). Moreover, limited work has tested mechanisms of transmission of risk from these parent factors. This study addresses these gaps by testing prospective associations of parental CU and expectancies with offspring CU and CU problems, and perceived parental approval of offspring CU as a potential mediator. Method: A community sample of 314 EA and caregiver dyads completed three annual assessments (mean age = 19.13). The sample was 54% female and majority White/non-Hispanic (76%). Caregivers reported on their cannabis expectancies and use, and EA reported on their CU, CU-related problems, and perceived parental approval of CU. Results: Longitudinal structural equation modeling supported a mediated pathway such that high parental positive cannabis expectancies were associated with perceived parental approval of CU, which in turn, predicted increases in EA CU and CU problems. Parental negative expectancies had a significant indirect effect but in the opposite direction. Indirect effects were found above and beyond parental CU, which was not associated with offspring CU. Conclusions: This is the first study to test prospective indirect effects of parental cannabis expectancies on offspring CU. Findings suggest parents' attitudes, even in the absence of parental use, confer risk for offspring use by shaping perceived acceptance of CU, suggesting parental expectancies as targets for parent-based CU interventions.

Objective: We evaluate if alcohol use and/or alcohol use disorder symptoms predict experiences of cannabis use disorder symptoms among adolescents and young adults and whether the relationships differ based on frequency of cannabis use, recency of cannabis initiation and age. Method: Data were drawn from five annual surveys of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2014-2018) to include adolescents and young adults (age 12 to 21 years) who reported using cannabis and alcohol at least once in the past 30 days. Results: Number of alcohol use disorder symptoms, over and above alcohol quantity or frequency, was positively associated with each of the cannabis use disorder symptoms as well as the total number of cannabis use disorder symptoms endorsed. The association between alcohol and cannabis use disorder symptoms was stronger among those who were younger and those who initiated cannabis use within the past 2 years. Conclusions: Treatment should consider these and other cross-over effects of substance disorder symptoms when addressing risk for chronic and dependent use.

Posttraumatic stress symptoms and callous-unemotional (CU) traits, both of which can be consequences of childhood maltreatment, have been implicated as potential mediators of this relationship, but despite phenotypic overlap have not been examined within the same model. Objective: The current cross-sectional study examined the indirect effect of childhood maltreatment severity on risky drug and alcohol use behaviors though PTSS and CU traits. Methods: Undergraduates (n = 355, 54.4% female) with childhood maltreatment histories completed questionnaires regarding childhood maltreatment, PTSS, substance use behaviors, and CU traits. Path modeling was utilized to examine indirect effects of childhood maltreatment on risky alcohol and drug use behaviors. Results: Overall the model demonstrated good fit. PTSS and CU traits were found to fully mediate the childhood maltreatment severity to risky alcohol use behaviors, with PTSS demonstrating a trending mediational effect to risky drug usage. Results support multiple pathways to risky alcohol use for individuals with childhood maltreatment histories through PTSS and CU traits, suggesting both PTSS as well as CU traits as potential targets of intervention for alcohol misuse among individuals with childhood maltreatment experiences.

Performance of a Predictive Model versus Prescription-Based Thresholds in Identifying Patients at Risk of Fatal Opioid Overdose								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	3			396	403		10.1080/10826084.2020.1868520			DEC 25 2020	2020	Background: Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) collect controlled substance prescriptions dispensed within a state. Many PDMP programs perform targeted outreach (i.e., "unsolicited reporting") for patients who exceed numerical thresholds, however, the degree to which patients at highest risk of fatal opioid overdose are identified has not been compared with one another or with a predictive model. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed using statewide PDMP data for Maryland residents aged 18 to 80 years with an opioid fill between April to June 2015. The outcome was opioid-related overdose death in 2015 or 2016. A multivariable logistic regression model and three PDMP thresholds were evaluated: (1) multiple provider episodes; (2) high daily average morphine milligram equivalents (MME); and (3) overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Results: The validation cohort consisted of 170,433 individuals and 244 deaths. The predictive model captured more individuals who died (46.3% of total deaths) and had a higher death rate (7.12 per 1000) when the risk score cutoff (0.0030) was selected for a comparable size of high-risk individuals (n = 15,881) than those meeting the overlapping opioid/benzodiazepine prescriptions (n = 17,440; 33.2% of total deaths; 4.64 deaths per 1000) and high MME (n = 14,675; 24.6% of total deaths; 4.09 deaths per 1000) thresholds. Conclusions: The predictive model identified more individuals at risk of fatal opioid overdose as compared with PDMP thresholds commonly used for unsolicited reporting. PDMP programs could improve their targeting of unsolicited reports to reach more individuals at risk of overdose by using predictive models instead of simple threshold-based approaches.

An understanding of current and early life correlates of prescription opioid behaviors can help inform clinical care, public health interventions, and future life course research. Methods: Using data from Waves I (1994-1995; participants ages 12-18 years) and V (2016-2018; participants ages 34-42 years) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 10,685), we examined adolescent and adult demographic, mental and physical health, substance use, and behavioral characteristics associated with past 30-day prescription opioid use only, misuse only, and both use and misuse to no recent use or misuse in adulthood. Results: Overall, 2.3% of adult participants reported past 30-day prescription opioid use only, 6.3% reported past 30-day misuse only, and 1.3% reported both prescribed use and misuse in the past 30 days. Physical health conditions in adolescence and adulthood were most common among those reporting use only and both use and misuse. Mental health conditions, other substance use, and delinquent behaviors in adolescence and adulthood were most common among those reporting misuse only and both use and misuse. Conclusions: Results from this nationally representative sample highlight the prevalence of specific prescription opioid behaviors and underscore the importance of targeting underlying drivers of prescription opioid use and misuse early in the life course. Continued implementation individual- and population-level approaches will be critical to addressing continued demand for opioids.

Indeed, young infants have been shown to attribute goals to unfamiliar actions as early as 3 months of age, but this ability appears restricted to actions performed by individuals. In contrast, attributing shared goals to actions performed by multiple individuals seems to emerge only in the second year of life. Considering the restrictions that this would impose on infants' understanding and learning from interactions in their environment, we reexamine this ability by introducing 9-month-old infants to simple joint actions, in which two agents coordinate their actions toward the same goal. To establish whether infants formed an expectation about future actions of these agents, infants' cortical activity was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The hemodynamic response, recorded in (p)STS, indicated that infants attributed goals to simultaneous and coordinated joint actions of two individuals. Thus, even prior to actively engaging in collaborative activities themselves, infants can attribute shared goals to observed joint actions, enabling infants to learn from, and about, the complementary roles of social interactions, a central characteristic of human culture.

Users often perceive ENDS as being less harmful than traditional cigarettes. This study investigated the relationship between use of ENDS and asthma in a representative sample of adults. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, we used data from the Kentucky Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey data from 2016-2017. Using a weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis, we identified important covariates to adjust for to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of asthma due to ENDS and other modifiable risk factors factors (cigarette use, obesity, education, and employment). The confidence intervals for the PAFs were estimated using bootstrap methods of variance estimation. Results: We found that 10.6% of those aged 18-30 reported currently had asthma. After adjusting for noted covariates, ENDS use did not significantly increase the odds of asthma. In the final PAF model, the PAF of asthma due to ENDS was 0.4% (95% CI: -5.41, 6.21). Conclusion: While these findings suggest only modest effects of ENDS use on asthma prevalence, future research including older age groups and more long-term users might produce different results.

When exposed to social media advertisements, users view comments written in response to the ad and user engagement metrics, in addition to the ad itself. Here, the independent effect of different types of comments on alcohol craving was assessed. Methods: In all, n = 722 participants were randomized to view either no comments, pro-drinking comments, anti-drinking comments, warning labels, or industry responsibility messages associated with six alcohol ads. Alcohol cravings, measured using the Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire (DAQ), were assessed before and after ad exposure. Smoking urges were also assessed. The significance of main effects was determined using repeated-measures ANCOVA. Results: Warning labels significantly decreased scores on the desires and intentions to drink DAQ sub-scale (p = .025) and decreased smoking urges (p = .024). Pro-drinking comments significantly increased scores on the control of drinking sub-scale (p = .006). Conclusions: The findings suggest that user-generated comments can influence the desire to drink and smoking urges, beyond the effects of ads themselves. If so, alcohol warning labels may decrease alcohol cravings when used in this way. Additionally, to limit the loss of control over drinking, the ability of social media users to post pro-drinking comments may need to be curtailed.

Geolocation of Maryland Medical Marijuana Dispensaries by Community Income and Racial Characteristics: An Ecological Design								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	2			318	326		10.1080/10826084.2020.1868516			DEC 24 2020	2020	Background: Prior investigations have documented disparities in the supply side of Maryland's Medical Marijuana program. Initially a disproportionate share of licenses to cultivate and distribute medical marijuana were awarded to Non-Hispanic White owned businesses. The state has implemented measures to ameliorate the inequity by prioritizing license awards to qualified minority owned businesses. Objectives: The objective of this study is to examine the racial and income characteristics of communities where licensed dispensaries are located. We quantify the racial and income characteristics of communities where Maryland medical cannabis dispensaries are located and explore whether Maryland medical marijuana dispensaries disproportionately locate in high-income, majority-White zip codes. Method: Using data from the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission and the American Communities Survey, we create geocodes for each of the operating dispensaries as of December 2019. We examine the distribution of medical cannabis dispensaries by zip code level household income and zip code level racial distribution. The data set encompasses 85 operating cannabis dispensaries in Maryland and 6.1 million Marylanders distributed across 468 zip codes in 2018-2019. Results: The analysis indicates that dispensaries are concentrated in zip codes whose residents are racially diverse, and with higher concentrations of retail establishments. Conclusion: Community level racial or income disparities in access to medical cannabis were not observed in Maryland. Access to medical cannabis, based on ability to pay out of pocket for the product, may be uneven.

It is usually accompanied by deficits in non-linguistic cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate in patients with aphasia the complex interrelationships between selected cognitive functions: auditory speech comprehension, working memory (WM), and temporal information processing (TIP) in the millisecond time range. Thirty right-handed subjects (20 males) aged from 27 to 82 years suffering from post-stroke aphasia participated in the study. Verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM) were assessed with: (1) a receptive verbal test and (2) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, respectively. Both these WM tests used the forward tasks (mainly engaging maintenance processes, i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and backward tasks (engaging both maintenance and manipulation processes, i.e., reordering and updating information). Auditory comprehension was assessed by receptive language tests, and TIP efficiency was assessed by auditory perception of temporal order in the millisecond time range. We observed better performance of forward WM tasks than backward ones, independently of the type of material used. Furthermore, the severity of auditory comprehension impairment correlated with the efficiency on both forward and backward VWM tasks and the backward SWM task. Further analysis revealed that TIP plays a crucial role only in the latter task. These results indicate the divergent pattern of interactions between WM and TIP depending on the type of WM tasks. Level of verbal competency appeared to play an important role in both VWM tasks, whereas TIP (which is associated with manipulation processes) appeared to be important for SWM, but only on the backward task.

J	Dong, Xue; Du, Xinxin; Bao, Min								Repeated Contrast Adaptation Does Not Cause Habituation of the Adapter								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						589634	10.3389/fnhum.2020.589634			DEC 23 2020	2020	Adaptation can optimize information processing by allowing the visual system to always adjust to the environment. However, only a few studies have investigated how the visual system makes adjustments to repeatedly occurring changes in the input, still less about the related neural mechanism. Our previous study found that contrast adaptation attenuated after multiple daily sessions of repeated adaptation, which was explained by the habituation of either the adapter's effective strength or the adaptation mechanisms. To examine the former hypothesis, in the present study we used the frequency tagging technique to measure the adapter-elicited steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitudes. Participants repeatedly adapted to the same contrast adapter in a top-up manner for six continuous days, which was called training of adaptation. The behavioral adaptation effect and SSVEP response to the trained adapter and an untrained control adapter were measured before and after training. The psychophysical results showed that the effect of adaptation in the trained condition significantly reduced after training, replicating our previous finding. Contradicting the prediction of the hypothesis that repeated adaptation attenuated the effective strength of the adapter, the SSVEP amplitude was unchanged after training, which was further confirmed by an equivalence test. Taken together, the results challenge the account of habituation of adapter in repeated adaptation, while leaving the account of habituation of adaptation mechanism to be tested.

Importantly, previous behavioral studies have consistently reported that one critical component of numerical inductive reasoning is checking, which often occurs when a discrepant element is discovered, and reprocessing is needed to determine whether the discrepancy is an error of the original series. However, less is known about the neural mechanism underlying the checking process. Given that the checking effect involves cognitive control processes, such as the incongruent resolution, that are linked to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), this study hypothesizes that the right DLPFC may play a specific role in the checking process. To test the hypothesis, this study utilized the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method that could modulate cortical excitability, and examined whether and how the stimulation of the right DLPFC via tDCS could modulate the checking effect during a number-series completion problem task. Ninety healthy participants were allocated to one of the anodal, cathodal, and sham groups. Subjects were required to verify whether number sequences formed rule-based series, and checking effect was assessed by the difference in performance between invalid and valid conditions. It was found that significantly longer response times (RTs) were exhibited in invalid condition compared with valid condition in groups of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Furthermore, the anodal tDCS significantly shortened the checking effect than those of the cathodal and sham groups, whereas no significantly prolonged checking effect was detected in the cathodal group. The current findings indicated that anodal tDCS affected the process of checking, which suggested that the right DLPFC might play a critical role in the checking process of numerical inductive reasoning by inhibiting incongruent response.

However, little is known so far about its effects and trainability. In the present study, we investigated the effects of up- and down-regulating SMR (12-15 Hz) coherence by means of neurofeedback training on EEG activity and memory functions. Twenty adults performed 10 neurofeedback training sessions in which half of them tried to increase EEG coherence between Cz and CPz in the SMR frequency range, while the other half tried to down-regulate coherence. Up-regulation of SMR coherence led to between- and within-session changes in EEG coherence. SMR power increased across neurofeedback training sessions but not within training sessions. Cross-over training effects on baseline EEG measures were also observed in this group. Up-regulation of SMR coherence was also associated with improvements in memory functions when comparing pre- and post-test results. Participants were not able to down-regulate SMR coherence. This group did not show any changes in baseline EEG measures or memory functions comparing pre- and post-test. Our results provide insights in the trainability and effects of connectivity-based neurofeedback training and indications for its practical application.

Increased Phase Cone Turnover in 80-250 Hz Bands Occurs in the Epileptogenic Zone During Interictal Periods								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						615744	10.3389/fnhum.2020.615744			DEC 23 2020	2020	We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80-150 and 150-250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.

To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range. Methods: Healthy participants aged 23-46 years (N = 18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points similar to 12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (T-CRE) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of T-CRE values. Results: The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2 degrees C with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time [F-(1,F- 1,F-591) = 37.0, p < 0.0001] and for brain region [F-(46,F- 1,F-591) = 2.66, p < 0.0001]. The time*brain region interaction was not significant [F-(46,F- 1,F-591) = 0.80, p = 0.83]. Participants' T-CRE was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 to 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); majority of ROIs had a COVrep Conclusions: Brain temperature measurements were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring brain temperature changes in health and disease. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain T-CRE, as well as the threshold above which T-CRE is likely pathological.

Overground Walking Decreases Alpha Activity and Entrains Eye Movements in Humans								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						561755	10.3389/fnhum.2020.561755			DEC 22 2020	2020	Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (similar to 10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.

A Necker cube with sinusoidally modulated pixels' intensity in the front and rear faces with frequencies 6.67 Hz (60/9) and 8.57 Hz (60/7), respectively, was presented to 12 healthy volunteers, who interpreted the cube as either left- or right-oriented. The tags of these frequencies and their second harmonics were identified in the average Fourier spectra of the MEG data recorded from the visual cortex. In the first part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to voluntarily control their attention by interpreting the cube orientation as either being on the left or right. Accordingly, we observed the dominance of the corresponding spectral component, and voluntary attention performance was measured. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a red marker at the center of the cube image without putting forth effort in its interpretation. The alternation of the dominant spectral energies at the second harmonics of the stimulation frequencies was treated as changes in the cube orientation. Based on the results of the first experimental stage and using a wavelet analysis, we developed a method which allowed us to identify the currently perceived cube orientation. Finally, we characterized involuntary attention using the distribution of dominance times when focusing attention on one of the cube orientations, which was related to voluntary attention performance and brain noise. In particular, we confirmed our hypothesis that higher attention performance is associated with stronger brain noise.

Evidence for [Coronal] Underspecification in Typical and Atypical Phonological Development								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						580697	10.3389/fnhum.2020.580697			DEC 22 2020	2020	The Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) theory predicts that [coronal] is the language universal default place of articulation for phonemes. This assumption has been consistently supported with adult behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data; however, this underspecification claim has not been tested in developmental populations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children demonstrate [coronal] underspecification patterns similar to those of adults. Two English consonants differing in place of articulation, [labial] /b/ and [coronal] /d/, were presented to 24 children (ages 4-6 years) characterized by either a typically developing phonological system (TD) or a phonological disorder (PD). Two syllables, /balpha/ and /dalpha/, were presented in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Underspecification was examined with three analyses: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of single-subject data. Contrary to previous adult findings, children with PD demonstrated a large positive mismatch response (PMR) to /balpha/ while the children with TD exhibited a negative mismatch response (MMN); significant group differences were not observed in the /dalpha/ responses. Moreover, the /balpha/ deviant ERP response was significantly larger in the TD children than in the children with PD. At the single-subject level, more children demonstrated mismatch responses to /dalpha/ than to /balpha/, though some children had a /balpha/ mismatch response and no /dalpha/ mismatch response. While both groups of children demonstrated similar responses to the underspecified /dalpha/, their neural responses to the more specified /balpha/ varied. These findings are interpreted within a proposed developmental model of phonological underspecification, wherein children with PD are functioning at a developmentally less mature stage of phonological acquisition than their same-aged TD peers. Thus, phonological underspecification is a phenomenon that likely develops over time with experience and exposure to language.

Combining Gamma With Alpha and Beta Power Modulation for Enhanced Cortical Mapping in Patients With Focal Epilepsy								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						555054	10.3389/fnhum.2020.555054			DEC 21 2020	2020	About one third of patients with epilepsy have seizures refractory to the medical treatment. Electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) is the gold standard for the identification of "eloquent" areas prior to resection of epileptogenic tissue. However, it is time-consuming and may cause undesired side effects. Broadband gamma activity (55-200 Hz) recorded with extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) during cognitive tasks may be an alternative to ESM but until now has not proven of definitive clinical value. Considering their role in cognition, the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) bands could further improve the identification of eloquent cortex. We compared gamma, alpha and beta activity, and their combinations for the identification of eloquent cortical areas defined by ESM. Ten patients with intractable focal epilepsy (age: 35.9 +/- 9.1 years, range: 22-48, 8 females, 9 right handed) participated in a delayed-match-to-sample task, where syllable sounds were compared to visually presented letters. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to find the optimal weighting of each band for predicting ESM-defined categories and estimated the diagnostic ability by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Gamma activity increased more in eloquent than in non-eloquent areas, whereas alpha and beta power decreased more in eloquent areas. Diagnostic ability of each band was close to 0.7 for all bands but depended on multiple factors including the time period of the cognitive task, the location of the electrodes and the patient's degree of attention to the stimulus. We show that diagnostic ability can be increased by 3-5% by combining gamma and alpha and by 7.5-11% when gamma and beta were combined. We then show how ECoG power modulation from cognitive testing can be used to map the probability of eloquence in individual patients and how this probability map can be used in clinical settings to optimize ESM planning. We conclude that the combination of gamma and beta power modulation during cognitive testing can contribute to the identification of eloquent areas prior to ESM in patients with refractory focal epilepsy.

Noninvasive clinical measures within the scopes of practice of those professions sensitive to cognitive impairment are needed. Purpose: This study examined the differences of probable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on latency and mean amplitude of the P3b auditory event-related potential. Method: Fifty-four participants comprised two groups according to cognitive status (cognitively normal older adults [CNOA], n = 25; probable MCI, n = 29). P3b was recorded using an oddball paradigm for speech (/ba/, /da/) and non-speech (1000, 2000 Hz) stimuli. Amplitudes and latencies were compared from six electrodes (FPz, Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz) between groups across stimulus probability and type. Results: CNOA participants had larger P3b mean amplitudes for deviant stimuli than those with probable MCI. Group effects of latency were isolated to deviant stimuli at FCz only when those with unclear P3bs were included. Findings did not covary with age or education. Overall, CNOAs showed a large P3b oddball effect while those with probable MCI did not. Conclusions: P3b can be used to show electrophysiological differences between older adults with and without probable MCI. These results support the development of educational materials targeting professionals using auditory-evoked potentials.

J	Rieker, Jennifer A.; Reales, Jose Manuel; Ballesteros, Soledad								The Effect of Bilingualism on Cue-Based vs. Memory-Based Task Switching in Older Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						610548	10.3389/fnhum.2020.610548			DEC 18 2020	2020	Findings suggest a positive impact of bilingualism on cognition, including the later onset of dementia. However, it is not clear to what extent these effects are influenced by variations in attentional control demands in response to specific task requirements. In this study, 20 bilingual and 20 monolingual older adults performed a task-switching task under explicit task-cuing vs. memory-based switching conditions. In the cued condition, task switches occurred in random order and a visual cue signaled the next task to be performed. In the memory-based condition, the task alternated after every second trial in a predictable sequence without presenting a cue. The performance of bilinguals did not vary across experimental conditions, whereas monolinguals experienced a pronounced increase in response latencies and error rates in the cued condition. Both groups produced similar switch costs (difference in performance on switch trials as opposed to repeating trials within the mixed-task block) and mixing costs (difference in performance on repeat trials of a mixed-task block as opposed to trials of a single-task block), but bilinguals produced them with lower response latencies. The cognitive benefits of bilingualism seem not to apply to executive functions per se but to affect specific cognitive processes that involve task-relevant context processing. The present results suggest that lifelong bilingualism could promote in older adults a flexible adjustment to environmental cues, but only with increased task demands. However, due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Signal-Space Projection Suppresses the tACS Artifact in EEG Recordings; Signal-Space Projection Suppresses the tACS Artifact in EEG Recordings								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE; FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						536070	10.3389/fnhum.2020.536070			DEC 18 2020	2020	Background To probe the functional role of brain oscillations, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has proven to be a useful neuroscientific tool. Because of the excessive tACS-caused artifact at the stimulation frequency in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, tACS + EEG studies have been mostly limited to compare brain activity between recordings before and after concurrent tACS. Critically, attempts to suppress the artifact in the data cannot assure that the entire artifact is removed while brain activity is preserved. The current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of specific artifact correction techniques to clean tACS-contaminated EEG data. New Method In the first experiment, we used a phantom head to have full control over the signal to be analyzed. Driving pre-recorded human brain-oscillation signals through a dipolar current source within the phantom, we simultaneously applied tACS and compared the performance of different artifact-correction techniques: sine subtraction, template subtraction, and signal-space projection (SSP). In the second experiment, we combined tACS and EEG on one human subject to demonstrate the best-performing data-correction approach in a proof of principle. Results The tACS artifact was highly attenuated by SSP in the phantom and the human EEG; thus, we were able to recover the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory activity. In the human experiment, event-related desynchronization could be restored after correcting the artifact. Comparison With Existing Methods The best results were achieved with SSP, which outperformed sine subtraction and template subtraction. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SSP by applying it to a phantom measurement with pre-recorded signal and one human tACS + EEG dataset. For a full validation of SSP, more data are needed.

However, there has been little empirical research on the perspectives of experts developing these technologies. We conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews with aDBS researchers regarding their data sharing practices and their perspectives on ethical and policy issues related to sharing. Researchers expressed support for and a commitment to sharing, with most saying that they were either sharing their data or would share in the future and that doing so was important for advancing the field. However, those who are sharing reported a variety of sharing partners, suggesting heterogeneity in sharing practices and lack of the broad sharing that would reflect principles of open science. Researchers described several concerns and barriers related to sharing, including privacy and confidentiality, the usability of shared data by others, ownership and control of data (including potential commercialization), and limited resources for sharing. They also suggested potential solutions to these challenges, including additional safeguards to address privacy issues, standardization and transparency in analysis to address issues of data usability, professional norms and heightened cooperation to address issues of ownership and control, and streamlining of data transmission to address resource limitations. Researchers also offered a range of views on the sensitivity of neural activity data (NAD) and data related to mental health in the context of sharing. These findings are an important input to deliberations by researchers, policymakers, neuroethicists, and other stakeholders as they navigate ethics and policy questions related to aDBS research.

Moreover, the influence of these interventions on embryo cleavage kinetics has not been investigated. Objective: The aim of this work was to study whether stress management in couples undergoing an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle influences stress levels, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in granulosa cells, and cleavage-stage embryos. Methods: Infertile couples were randomized into a treatment as usual (TAU) group (n = 30) and stress management program (SMP) group (n = 29) at the beginning of an ICSI cycle. Couples in the SMP group attended education and relaxation sessions at each visit to the clinic for folliculometry. The perceived stress scale (PSS) was used to assess stress levels at the beginning and end of the cycle. Moreover, mtDNA levels of granulosa cells and embryo morphokinetics were evaluated. Results: Post-intervention, women in the SMP group had significantly lower PSS scores than their initial PSS (p < 0.001; effect size, ES = 0.5) and than the final PSS of the TAU group (p = 0.02; ES = 0.09). Additionally, mtDNA levels were significantly lower in luteal granulosa cells of the SMP group than the TAU group (p = 0.02). An earlier time of pronuclei appearance (p = 0.03) and time to 2 cells (p = 0.015) and a faster time to full compaction (p = 0.045) were detected in the embryos of the SMP group compared with the TAU group. Conclusion(s): The implemented program may reduce stress levels, retard first embryo cleavage, and accelerate embryo compaction. Further studies with an active control group are needed to confirm these results.

Difficulties in social interactions have been particularly noted in people diagnosed with major depression disorder (MDD) and social phobia (SP). It remains poorly understood, however, how these variables interact on a moment-to-moment basis and which variables moderate this relationship. Psychological flexibility, or the ability to be open to experiences while maintaining engagement in valued activities, may help moderate the relationship between stress and social interaction. Objective: This study examined these variables in participants diagnosed with MDD and SP and compared them to a control group. Methods: Participants were diagnosed with a mental disorder (n = 118 MDD; n = 47 SP) or were in the control group consisting of participants without MDD or SP (n = 119). Using the event sampling methodology (ESM), participants were queried six times per day for 7 days about stress, social interactions, and emotional response (rigid vs. flexible). Results: Higher current stress levels were related to more social interactions. This relationship was even stronger in situations when response flexibility was increased, especially in the clinical groups. Conclusions: Data suggest that a healthy psychological process (flexible emotional responding) buffers the relationship between stress and social interactions. We discuss how these variables interact and whether these patterns may paradoxically contribute to the maintenance of psychopathology.

Brain imaging studies have shown that the inhibition of implicit stereotypes was dependent on this domain-general cognitive control mechanism. Based on this knowledge, the present study investigated the neural oscillatory correlates of implicit gender stereotype control in an extrinsic affective Simon task (EAST) using electrophysiological methods. Participants in this task conducted verification to white gender names and colored gender traits, and their behavioral response and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded during their performances. As predicted, stereotype-inconsistent trials resulted in reduced response accuracies and slower response times than stereotype-consistent trials. For the event-related potential (ERP) results, the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was accompanied by an enhanced N400 amplitude but an attenuated late positive potential amplitude. In contrast, early attentional components such as P2 and N2 as well as their amplitudes were impacted by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. In addition, based on time-frequency (TF) analysis, we found that the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was also accompanied by an event-related synchronization on the frontal theta oscillation. This frontal theta appeared at a late processing stage and persisted across a time window from N400 to late positive potential. Additionally, this enhanced frontal theta effect was not modulated by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. Based on these findings, the feature of frontal theta oscillation in the implicit gender stereotype control process was discussed.

PD is a moderately heritable anxiety disorder whose pathogenesis is not well understood. Recently, a tri-allelic serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR/rs25531) polymorphism was reported to be more sensitive to personality traits compared to the bi-allelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. We hypothesized that the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphism may lead to a pathological anxious state depending on the presence or absence of a comorbidity in PD. Methods: In this study, we investigated the relationship between comorbidities in PD and tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms. A total of 515 patients with PD (148 males, 367 females) were genotyped, and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory as well as anxiety-related psychological tests were administered. Depression, BPD, and AG were diagnosed as comorbidities. Results: For the tri-allele 5-HTTLPR genotype, a significant interaction effect was found between openness to experience and comorbid depression. Examination of the interaction between AG and the tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR genotype revealed that L' allele carriers are associated with higher trait anxiety than the S'S' genotype group in PD without AG. Conclusion: Some anxiety and personality traits can be characterized by the tri-allelic gene effect of 5-HTTLPR. These results suggest that tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR genotypes have genetic effects on the presence of comorbidities of PD.

The application of anodal tDCS on the prefrontal cortex has indicated improvement in cognitive functioning. The cingulate cortex, situated in the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex, has been identified as a core region performing cognitive functions. Most of the previous studies investigating the impact of stimulation on the prefrontal cortex stimulated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), however, the impact of stimulation on cingulate has not been explored. The current study investigates the effect of stimulation on the resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with other regions of the brain and changes in behavioral results in a color-word Stroop task, which has repeatedly elicited activation in different regions of the cingulate. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental and sham group, and their medial prefrontal area was stimulated using MRI compatible tDCS. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive Stroop task were monitored before, during, and after the stimulation. Neuroimaging results indicated a significant decrease in resting-state functional connectivity in the experimental group during and after stimulation as compared to before stimulation in two clusters including right insular cortex, right central operculum cortex, right frontal operculum cortex and right planum polare with the left anterior cingulate cortex (L-ACC) selected as the seed. The behavioral results indicated a significant decrease in reaction time (RT) following stimulation in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Moreover, the change in functional connectivity in subcortical regions with L-ACC as the seed and change in RT was positively correlated. The results demonstrated that ACC has a close functional relationship with the subcortical regions, and stimulation of ACC can modulate these connections, which subsequently improves behavioral performance, thus, providing another potential target of stimulation for cognitive enhancement.

In order to improve the accuracy of the emotion recognition, a method of EEG access for emotion recognition based on a deep hybrid network was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the collected EEG was decomposed into four frequency band signals, and the multiscale sample entropy (MSE) features of each frequency band were extracted. Secondly, the constructed 3D MSE feature matrices were fed into a deep hybrid network for autonomous learning. The deep hybrid network was composed of a continuous convolutional neural network (CNN) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Lastly, HMMs trained with multiple observation sequences were used to replace the artificial neural network classifier in the CNN, and the emotion recognition task was completed by HMM classifiers. The proposed method was applied to the DEAP dataset for emotion recognition experiments, and the average accuracy could achieve 79.77% on arousal, 83.09% on valence, and 81.83% on dominance. Compared with the latest related methods, the accuracy was improved by 0.99% on valence and 14.58% on dominance, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Method: Participants were 18 CWS (16 boys and two girls; mean age 4 years, 5 months) and 18 age- and gender-matched CWNS. Participants' psychophysiological responses were measured during two baselines and two picture viewing conditions. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate were measured to assess emotional reactivity. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured to assess emotional regulation. Participants' shyness and executive function were assessed via parent report and considered for their effects on participants' psychophysiological responses. Results: First, CWNS and CWS did not differ in their initial baseline SCL, heart rate, or RSA, but all participants had higher SCL and lower RSA in the second baseline, subsequent to the first challenge condition, compared to the first baseline. Second, during the challenge conditions, CWS did not differ from CWNS in their SCL, but showed a significantly higher heart rate than CWNS. Third, CWS exhibited a significantly lower RSA during the challenge conditions compared to CWNS. Lastly, the temperamental quality of shyness was associated with preschool-age children's SCL, such that participants who were rated higher in shyness had a higher SCL during the challenge conditions. Participants' executive function had a marginally significant effect on the RSA, such that the participants who had higher executive function composite scores exhibited lower RSA during the challenge conditions. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CWS and CWNS did not differ in their emotional reactivity and emotional regulation abilities at rest. During challenge conditions, however, CWS tended to be more emotionally reactive, as indicated by a higher heart rate, and also employed more emotional regulation, indexed by a greater decrease in RSA, compared to CWNS. Preschool-age children's behavior is largely dominated by reactivity, but there is the emergence of regulation, which can help children adjust to various contextual demands. For CWS who are more emotionally reactive, regulatory skills may be particularly critical to their prognosis and treatment.

The exact make-up of ability traits, however, is often narrowly defined and lacks a comprehensive basis. We attempt to simplify the spectrum of human ability, similar to how five personality traits are widely believed to describe most personalities. Finding such a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we identified four underlying ability traits within the National Institutes of Health Toolbox normative data (n = 1, 369): (1) Motor-endurance, (2) Emotional processing, (3) Executive and cognitive function, and (4) Social interaction. We used the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) to show that Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r(2) = 0.305 +/- 0.021), and the biological nature of these ability traits was also shown by calculating their heritability (31 and 49%, respectively) from twin data.

Objective: The aim is to assess the effectiveness of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) as a scalable approach for treating depression in a routine care setting. Methods: This is an observer-masked, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a randomization ratio of 1:1.Patients with CBP and diagnosed depressive disorder (mild to moderate severity) were recruited from 82 orthopedic rehabilitation clinics across Germany. The intervention group (IG) received a guided depression IMI tailored to CBP next to treatment-as-usual (TAU; including medication), while the control group (CG) received TAU. The primary outcome was observer-masked clinician-rated Hamilton depression severity (9-week follow-up). The secondary outcomes were: further depression outcomes, pain-related outcomes, health-related quality of life, and work capacity. Biostatistician blinded analyses using regression models were conducted by intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis. Results: Between October 2015 and July 2017, we randomly assigned 210 participants (IG, n = 105; CG, n = 105), mostly with only a mild pain intensity but substantial pain disability. No statistically significant difference in depression severity between IG and CG was observed at the 9-week follow-up (beta = -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.05). Explorative secondary depression (4/9) and pain-related (4/6) outcomes were in part significant (p < 0.05). Health-related quality of life was significantly higher in the IG. No differences were found in work capacity. Conclusion: The results indicate that an IMI for patients with CBP and depression in a routine care setting has limited impact on depression. Benefits in pain and health-related outcomes suggest that an IMI might still be a useful measure to improve routine care.

Moral reasoning and moral conflict in patients of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Frontotemporal dementia spectrum								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	6			668	677		10.1080/17470919.2020.1850521			NOV 1 2020	2020	The aim of this study was to investigate the moral reasoning and moral conflict in patients of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - frontotemporal dementia (ALSFTD) spectrum. Ten ALS patients without cognitive impairment, 10 ALS patients with cognitive or behavioral impairment, 10 ALSFTD patients and 23 controls were examined with neuropsychological and behavioral tests as well as with a set of eight well -designed moral dilemmas. The responses to the moral dilemmas were used as proxies to evaluate interpersonal moral reasoning. Reactivity to change, reaction time and arousal were used as markers of moral conflict. ALSFTD patients showed more "utilitarian" responses and less moral conflict than control participants. ALS patients without dementia showed a trend toward slower reaction time, which could be largely attributed to physical disability. No significant changes in arousal were found in ALS patients compared with control participants. Behavioral changes (apathy and dysexecutive symptoms) were partly responsible for the changes found in patients of the ALSFTD spectrum. Our results suggest that most ALS patients without dementia, but not those with concomitant dementia, would be able to deal with the conflict of complex moral decisions, such as end-of-life decisions, at least in mild to moderate stages of the disease.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a Body in Mind Training (BMT) program for adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), an active comparison protocol called Quality of Life and Psychoeducation (QoL), and treatment with fluoxetine (FLX). Methods: This study comprises a 3-arm parallel-group, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03072264). Adults with a primary diagnosis of GAD and no current treatment were recruited from the community and randomized in a ratio 1:1:1. The primary outcomes were assessed by means of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) at week 8. Data were analyzed using a superiority analysis (BMT vs. QoL) and a noninferiority analysis (BMT vs. FLX). Results: A total of 249 participants were included and 223 were analyzed (76 BMT, 79 FLX, and 68 QoL). All groups improved after intervention. However, BMT was not superior to QoL at week 8 (mean difference = -1.36; p = 0.47), nor was it noninferior to FLX as assessed with theHAM-A (mean difference = 3.5; 95% CI -0.06 to 7.06; noninferiority margin = -2.43; p = 0.054). QoL (mean difference = 3.54; p = 0.04) and FLX (mean difference = -7.72; 95% CI -10.89 to -4.56; noninferiority margin = -2.09; p < 0.001) were superior to BMT in reducing PSWQ score. Conclusion: Our data suggest that BMT, in its current format, cannot be considered an effective mindfulness protocol to improve GAD.

Methods: Seventeen healthy young adults participated in the study. Each subject maintained an upright standing position on a force plate with/without rubber-foam, with their eyes open/closed, to measure the position of their foot center of pressure. Thirty minutes after baseline measurements under four possible conditions (eyes open/closed with/without rubber-foam) performed without nGVS (intensity: 1 mA, duration: 40 s), the stimulation trials (sham-nGVS/real-nGVS) were conducted under the same conditions in random order, which were then repeated a week or more later. The total center of pressure (COP) path length movement (COP-TL) and COP movement velocity in the mediolateral (Vel-ML) and anteroposterior (Vel-AP) directions were recorded for 30 s during nGVS. Furthermore, electromyography activity of the right tibial anterior muscle and soleus muscle was recorded for the same time and analyzed. Results: Three-way analysis of variance and post-hoc multiple comparison revealed a significant increment in COP-related parameters by nGVS, and a significant increment in soleus muscle activity on rubber. There was no significant effect of eye condition on any parameter. Conclusions: During nGVS (1 mA), body sway and muscle activity in the lower limb may be increased depending not on the visual condition, but on the foot somatosensory condition.

The objective of the present study was to assess a new way of interpreting widely used screening tests, generating a new score: the CSIS (Combined Screening Interpretation Score). The CSIS considers the performance in various routine screening tests (MMSE, Clock drawing test, Short form of the Boston naming test, Phonological and Semantic fluency tests and the Frontal Assessment Battery) by summing up their gross scores in one general score. Methods: We calculated the CSIS of 90 Hispanic older adults without dementia (40 controls and 50 patients with a diagnosis of MCI). The differences of the CSIS between the groups, and the discriminative capacity of the CSIS and each separate test were analyzed. Results: Significant differences in the CSIS were observed between the groups, as a higher discriminative capacity of the CSIS compared to the other screening tests. A score of 86 points in the CSIS discriminates the groups with 84% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Conclusion: It is concluded that the CSIS is a useful, simple and brief tool to assess the cognitive performance of subjects with MCI.

It is unclear whether such modulations can be observed if one only imagines stimuli to be socially relevant. In a preregistered EEG study (N = 40), participants were presented neutral, positive and negative personality-descriptive adjectives, and given a subsequent feedback revealing whether or not the adjective described their personality. While it was emphasized that feedback occurred randomly, participants were asked either to treat the feedback information as randomly chosen or to imagine it represented a veridical social feedback. Imagined social context increased EPN, P3, and LPP amplitudes to feedback. Importantly, social context and emotional content interacted, resulting in enhanced processing of imagined social negative feedback for the N1 and EPN. These results demonstrate that social attributions can easily be elicited by instructions, modulating early and late processing stages, speaking for a strong affiliation motive.

It is suggested that children with DCD show deficits in motor learning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) enhances motor learning in adults and children but is unstudied in DCD. We aimed to investigate if tDCS, paired with motor skill training, facilitates motor learning in a pediatric sample with DCD. Methods: Twenty-eight children with diagnosed DCD (22 males, mean age: 10.62 +/- 1.44 years) were randomized and placed into a treatment or sham group. Anodal tDCS was applied (1 mA, 20 min) in conjunction with fine manual training over 5 consecutive days. Children's motor functioning was assessed with the Purdue Pegboard Test and Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test at baseline, post-intervention and 6 weeks following intervention. Group differences in rates of motor learning and skill transfer/retention were examined using linear mixed modeling and repeated measures ANOVAs, respectively. Results: There were no serious adverse events or drop-outs and procedures were well-tolerated. Independent of group, all participants demonstrated improved motor scores over the 5 training days [F-(69.280), p < 0.001, 95% CI (0.152, 0.376)], with no skill decay observed at retention. There was no interaction between intervention group and day [F-(2.998), p = 0.086, 95% CI (-0.020, 0.297)]. Conclusion: Children with DCD demonstrate motor learning with long-term retention of acquired skill. Motor cortex tDCS did not enhance motor learning as seen in other populations. Before conclusions of tDCS efficacy can be drawn, additional carefully designed trials with reproducible results are required.

However, how whole brain functional connectivity pattern homogeneity and its corresponding functional connectivity changes in patients with migraine without aura is unknown. In the current study, we employed a recently developed whole brain functional connectivity homogeneity (FcHo) method to identify the voxel-wise changes of functional connectivity patterns in 21 patients with migraine without aura and 21 gender and age matched healthy controls. Moreover, resting-state functional connectivity analysis was used to reveal the changes of corresponding functional connectivities. FcHo analyses identified significantly decreased FcHo values in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), thalamus (THA), and left anterior insula (AI) in patients with migraine without aura compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity analyses further found decreased functional connectivities between PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), between AI and anterior cingulate cortex, and between THA and left precentral gyrus (PCG). The functional connectivities between THA and PCG were negatively correlated with pain intensity. Our findings indicated that whole brain FcHo and connectivity abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in patients with migraine without aura.

J	Rounds, James D.; Cruz-Garza, Jesus Gabriel; Kalantari, Saleh								Using Posterior EEG Theta Band to Assess the Effects of Architectural Designs on Landmark Recognition in an Urban Setting								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						584385	10.3389/fnhum.2020.584385			DEC 11 2020	2020	The process of urban landmark-based navigation has proven to be difficult to study in a rigorous fashion, primarily due to confounding variables and the problem of obtaining reliable data in real-world contexts. The development of high-resolution, immersive virtual reality technologies has opened exciting new possibilities for gathering data on human wayfinding that could not otherwise be readily obtained. We developed a research platform using a virtual environment and electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the neural processes associated with landmark usage and recognition during urban navigation tasks. By adjusting the architectural parameters of different buildings in this virtual environment, we isolated and tested specific design features to determine whether or not they served as a target for landmarking. EEG theta band (4-7 Hz) event-related synchronization/desynchronization over posterior scalp areas was evaluated at the time when participants observed each target building along a predetermined self-paced route. A multi-level linear model was used to investigate the effects of salient architectural features on posterior scalp areas. Our results support the conclusion that highly salient architectural features-those that contrast sharply with the surrounding environment-are more likely to attract visual attention, remain in short-term memory, and activate brain regions associated with wayfinding compared with non-salient buildings. After establishing this main aggregate effect, we evaluated specific salient architectural features and neural correlates of navigation processing. The buildings that most strongly associated extended gaze time, location recall accuracy, and changes in theta-band neural patterns with landmarking in our study were those that incorporated rotational twist designs and natural elements such as trees and gardens. Other building features, such as unusual facade patterns or building heights, were to a lesser extent also associated with landmarking.

The aim of this study was to examine changes in frontal midline theta rhythm (Fm theta) and autonomic nervous responses during craft activities, and to explore the physiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effectiveness of occupational therapy. To achieve this, we employed a simple craft activity as a task to induce Fm theta and performed simultaneous EEG and ECG recordings. For participants in which Fm theta activities were provoked, parasympathetic and sympathetic activities were evaluated during the appearance of Fm theta and rest periods using the Lorenz plot analysis. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic indices increased with the appearance of Fm theta compared to during resting periods. This suggests that a relaxed-concentration state is achieved by concentrating on craft activities. Furthermore, the appearance of Fm theta positively correlated with parasympathetic activity, and theta band activity in the frontal area were associated with sympathetic activity. This suggests that there is a close relationship between cardiac autonomic function and Fm theta activity.

We examined cognitive outcomes in a large cohort of ET DBS patients (pre-DBS and 1+ year after DBS). Methods: In a retrospective analysis, we used repeated-measures ANOVA testing to examine whether the age of tremor onset, age at DBS surgery, hemisphere side implanted with lead, unilateral vs. bilateral implantations, and presence of surgical complications influenced the cognitive outcomes. Neuropsychological outcomes of interest were verbal memory, executive functioning, working memory, language functioning, visuospatial functioning, and general cognitive function. Results: We identified 50 ET DBS patients; 29 (58%) males; the mean age of tremor onset was 35.84 (+/- 21.50) years with a median age of 38 years. The mean age at DBS was 68.18 (+/- 10.07) years. There were 37 unilateral 30 left, seven right, and 13 bilateral brain implantations. In the subgroup analysis, there was a significant interaction between assessment (pre vs. post) and age of tremor onset (38 years); F-(1,F-30) = 4.47; p = 0.043 for working memory. The post hoc testing found improvements for younger onset ET. Similarly, there was a significant interaction between assessment (pre vs. post) and complications vs. no complications subgroups; F-(1,F-45) = 4.34; p = 0.043 for verbal memory with worsening scores seen for ET patients with complications. The remaining tests were not significant. Conclusion: In this large cohort of ET patients with (>30% improvements), DBS was not accompanied by a significant decline in many cognitive domains. These outcomes were possibly related to the selection of patients with normal cognitive functioning before surgery, unilateral DBS implantations for the majority, and selection of patients with optimal response to DBS.

This article reports initial findings on the validity and reliability of the Emerging Adult Reasons for Substance use (EARS), a new measure of substance use motives based on Arnett's (2000) proposed emerging adult dimensions. Method: Content experts in emerging adulthood theory generated EARS items and collected data from a large online sample. We completed exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) on split halves of the total sample (n = 750). Then, we tested for invariance across genders and age cohorts, as well as examined cross-correlations with the Inventory of Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEA), Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ-Revised), and measures of substance use. Results: The EFA identified three internally consistent factors: Normative Expectancy, Developmental Strain, and Subjective Invulnerability. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the three factor model, but fit indices were slightly below published standards (RSMEA = .82, CFI = .85, TLI = .83, SRMR = .07). For Normative Expectancy and Developmental Strain, intercepts varied across age cohorts, with higher intercepts for emerging relative to older adults. The patterns of correlations generally supported the construct validity of the EARS subscales. Conclusion: The EARS is reliable and valid, and appears to measure developmentally specific motives for substance use. Additional studies may further validate this promising instrument.

The different motivations underlying why people drink predict different patterns of alcohol consumption. A drinking buddy (i.e. a friend with whom a person drinks alcohol) influences a person's drinking via social learning, leading to escalations in drinking over time. Purpose: Few studies have investigated drinking motives among peers and none have studied whether the drinking motives of a drinking buddy can influence another person's drinking behavior; we sought to fill that gap. Method: Same-sex drinking buddies (N = 174; 66.1% female) were assessed once monthly for four months using self-report questionnaires. Participants were on average 18.66 years-old (SD = 1.17). Results: Indistinguishable actor-partner interdependence models using multilevel path analysis were conducted, with each drinking motive predicting drinking frequency and quantity, respectively. There were significant actor effects for social, enhancement, conformity, and coping motives; moreover, the enhancement, social, and coping-anxiety motives of the drinking buddy influenced the individual's drinking frequency across the four months of the study. Conversely, only the enhancement motives of the buddy predicted drinking quantity in the individual when averaged across time. Sex was not a significant moderator of these effects. Importance: When targeting risky drinking behavior in a therapeutic context, assessing and addressing a person's reasons for drinking, as well as their drinking buddy's reasons for drinking, may reduce the risk of escalations in either friend's drinking frequency over time.

Developmental Trends of Visual Processing of Letters and Objects Using Naming Speed Tasks								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						562712	10.3389/fnhum.2020.562712			DEC 10 2020	2020	Studying the typical development of reading is key to understanding the precise deficits that underlie reading disabilities. An important correlate of efficient reading is the speed of naming arrays of simple stimuli such as letters and pictures. In this cross-sectional study, we examined developmental changes in visual processing that occurs during letter and object naming from childhood to early adulthood in terms of behavioral task efficiency, associated articulation and eye movement parameters, and the coordination between them, as measured by eye-voice span in both the spatial and temporal domains. We used naming speed (NS) tasks, in which participants were required to name sets of letters or simple objects as quickly and as accurately as possible. Single stimulus manipulations were made to these tasks to make the stimuli either more visually and/or phonologically similar to one another in order to examine how these manipulations affected task performance and the coordination between speech and eye movements. Across development there was an increased efficiency in speech and eye movement performance and their coordination in both the spatial and temporal domains. Furthermore, manipulations to the phonological and visual similarity of specific letter and object stimuli revealed that orthographic processing played a greater role than phonological processing in performance, with the contribution of phonological processing diminishing across development. This comprehensive typical developmental trajectory provides a benchmark for clinical populations to elucidate the nature of the cognitive dysfunction underlying reading difficulties.

Memory is also biased towards information associated with the prospect of reward. Given the adaptiveness of these effects, they may depend on similar mechanisms. We tested whether motivation drives both effects, with reward incentives that are known to boost extrinsic motivation and survival processing perhaps stimulating intrinsic motivation. Accordingly, we manipulated survival processing and reward incentive independently during an incidental-encoding task in which participants chose between pairs of words concerning their relevance for a scenario, and examined the effects on encoding event-related potentials (ERP) activity and later performance on a surprise recall test. We hypothesized that if survival processing fosters intrinsic motivation, it should reduce the beneficial effects of extrinsic motivation (reward incentive). In contrast to this prediction, we found that reward incentive and survival processing independently improved memory and that the P300, a measure of lower-level cognitive resource allocation, was increased by reward incentive independent of survival processing. Further, survival processing and reward incentive independently increased the frontal slow wave (FSW), a measure of higher-level elaboration. These findings suggest that while survival processing and reward incentive may both increase encoding elaboration, the memory-enhancing effect of survival processing does not depend on increased intrinsic motivation. Additionally, we replicated a recent finding whereby the survival processing effect generalizes to a choice-based encoding task and further showed that the beneficial effect of choice on memory likely does not interact with either survival processing or reward.

This effort may be hampered by the methods used to assess fatigue, which usually rely on retrospective memory reports. However, such reports are prone to memory bias and may not capture variability in fatigue in daily life; thereby failing to adequately represent symptom experience. This study aimed to assess the strength of the relationship between real-time experience of post-stroke fatigue and the commonly used retrospective Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Thirty individuals with stroke completed 10 daily questionnaires about momentary (here-and-now) fatigue for six consecutive days using the mHealth application PsyMate(TM) (Experience Sampling Method). From these real-time fatigue ratings (N = 1012), we calculated three indices: total average, peak fatigue, and fatigue on the final day. Afterwards, participants rated their fatigue retrospectively with the FSS. Results showed weak to moderate and strong correlations (range: .334, .667), with retrospective reports capturing up to 44% of the variance in the indices of momentary fatigue. Exploratory analyses also revealed that even individuals with similar total FSS scores demonstrated highly different day-to-day fatigue patterns. We conclude that retrospective measures may provide an incomplete view of post-stroke fatigue and diurnal variation therein.

This similarity suggests that the cognitive impairment(s) contributing to the structural language deficits in ASD and ADHD may be shared. Previous studies have speculated that procedural memory deficits may be the shared cognitive impairment. The procedural deficit hypothesis (PDH) argues that language deficits can be explained by differences in the neural structures underlying the procedural memory network. This hypothesis is based on the premise that the neural structures comprising the procedural network support language learning. In this study, we aimed to test the PDH in children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development (TD). Methods: One hundred and sixty-three participants (ages 10-21): 91 with ASD, 26 with ADHD, and 46 with TD, completed standardized measures of cognitive and language ability as well as structural magnetic resonance imaging. We compared the structural language abilities, the neural structures underlying the procedural memory network, and the relationship between structural language and neural structure across diagnostic groups. Results: Our analyses revealed that while the structural language abilities differed across ASD, ADHD, and TD groups, the thickness, area, and volume of the structures supporting the procedural memory network were not significantly different between diagnostic groups. Also, several neural structures were associated with structural language abilities across diagnostic groups. Only two of these structures, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior parietal gyrus, are known to be linked to the procedural memory network. Conclusions: The inferior frontal gyrus and the left superior parietal gyrus, have well-established roles in language learning independent of their role as part of the procedural memory system. Other structures such as the caudate and cerebellum, with critical roles in the procedural memory network, were not associated with structural language abilities across diagnostic groups. It is unclear whether the procedural memory network plays a fundamental role in language learning in ASD, ADHD, and TD.

Coping Motivated Alcohol Use: The Role of Social Anxiety and Dissociation								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	2			275	285		10.1080/10826084.2020.1861630			DEC 10 2020	2020	Background: Social anxiety has been associated with higher rates of negative alcohol use consequences, and this relationship appears to be accounted for by coping drinking motives. Dissociation is commonly present in anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder, and may serve to unconsciously reduce negative emotions when more effortful coping strategies are not effective. Objectives: The present study examined whether the relationship between social anxiety, coping motives, and alcohol consequences was moderated by dissociative symptoms. It was hypothesized that coping motives would mediate the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol consequences, and that dissociation would moderate the relationship between social anxiety and coping motives. Undergraduate students who endorsed alcohol use within the past 30 days (n = 320) were recruited from a large public university. Participants completed measures of social anxiety, dissociation, alcohol motives, and alcohol consequences as part of a larger online questionnaire. Results: Coping motives were found to mediate the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol consequences. Dissociation did not moderate the relationship between social anxiety and coping motives. Dissociation was significantly associated with alcohol consequences via coping motives. Conclusions: Future research should include longitudinal research designs or ecological momentary assessment designs and should examine these relationships in clinical and community samples.

The identification of unique, modifiable risk factors for alcohol use in this population is needed. Purpose/Objectives: Building on previous work highlighting the importance of each of athlete-specific drinking motives and alcohol expectancies, this study investigated whether athlete-specific psychosocial predictors optimize our ability to predict adolescent athlete alcohol consumption after accounting for general psychosocial predictors. Methods: Participants were 352 current high school student-athletes who completed a self-report questionnaire about their alcohol use attitudes, behaviors, and cognitions. Results: Hierarchical regression revealed that among the total sample, gender, class year, liquid courage/sociability, sexuality, and negative alcohol expectancies, and negative athletic-functioning alcohol expectancies predicted alcohol consumption. Among lifetime drinkers, gender, class year, enhancement motives, conformity motives (negative), negative athlete-functioning alcohol expectancies, and sport-related coping motives predicted alcohol consumption. Conclusions/Importance: Negative athletic-functioning alcohol expectancies and sport-related coping motives emerged as important, athlete-specific predictors of adolescent athlete alcohol use. These factors provide important opportunities for targeted prevention efforts.

Due to distinct pathogenesis, some associated structural and functional changes within the brain have been investigated in previous studies, but whole-brain structural alterations are incompletely understood. We extended the exploration of neuroanatomic differences in whole-brain structure in children with profound SNHL who are primarily users of Chinese sign language (CSL). We employed surface-based morphometry (SBM) and subcortical analyses. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 26 children with profound SNHL and 27 age- and sex-matched children with normal hearing were analyzed. Compared with the normal control (NC) group, children with profound SNHL showed diverse structural changes in surface-based and subcortical analyses, including decreased cortical thickness in the left postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, paracentral lobule, precuneus, the right transverse temporal gyri, and the middle temporal gyrus; a noticeable increase in the Local Gyrification Index (LGI) in the left precuneus and superior parietal lobule; and diverse changes in gray-matter volume (GMV) in different brain regions. Surface-based vertex analyses revealed regional contractions in the right thalamus, putamen, pallidum, and the brainstem of children with profound SNHL when compared with those in the NC group. Volumetric analyses showed decreased volumes of the right thalamus and pallidum in children with profound SNHL. Our data suggest that children with profound SNHL are associated with diffuse cerebral dysfunction to cortical and subcortical nuclei, and revealed neuroplastic reorganization in the precuneus, superior parietal lobule, and temporal gyrus. Our study provides robust evidence for changes in connectivity and structure in the brain associated with hearing loss.

Feasibility and Safety of Bilateral Hybrid EEG/EOG Brain/Neural-Machine Interaction								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						580105	10.3389/fnhum.2020.580105			DEC 9 2020	2020	Cervical spinal cord injuries (SCIs) often lead to loss of motor function in both hands and legs, limiting autonomy and quality of life. While it was shown that unilateral hand function can be restored after SCI using a hybrid electroencephalography/electrooculography (EEG/EOG) brain/neural hand exoskeleton (B/NHE), it remained unclear whether such hybrid paradigm also could be used for operating two hand exoskeletons, e.g., in the context of bimanual tasks such as eating with fork and knife. To test whether EEG/EOG signals allow for fluent and reliable as well as safe and user-friendly bilateral B/NHE control, eight healthy participants (six females, mean age 24.1 +/- 3.2 years) as well as four chronic tetraplegics (four males, mean age 51.8 +/- 15.2 years) performed a complex sequence of EEG-controlled bilateral grasping and EOG-controlled releasing motions of two exoskeletons visually presented on a screen. A novel EOG command performed by prolonged horizontal eye movements (>1 s) to the left or right was introduced as a reliable switch to activate either the left or right exoskeleton. Fluent EEG control was defined as average "time to initialize" (TTI) grasping motions below 3 s. Reliable EEG control was assumed when classification accuracy exceeded 80%. Safety was defined as "time to stop" (TTS) all unintended grasping motions within 2 s. After the experiment, tetraplegics were asked to rate the user-friendliness of bilateral B/NHE control using Likert scales. Average TTI and accuracy of EEG-controlled operations ranged at 2.14 +/- 0.66 s and 85.89 +/- 15.81% across healthy participants and at 1.90 +/- 0.97 s and 81.25 +/- 16.99% across tetraplegics. Except for one tetraplegic, all participants met the safety requirements. With 88 +/- 11% of the maximum achievable score, tetraplegics rated the control paradigm as user-friendly and reliable. These results suggest that hybrid EEG/EOG B/NHE control of two assistive devices is feasible and safe, paving the way to test this paradigm in larger clinical trials performing bimanual tasks in everyday life environments.

Neuromechanical Assessment of Activated vs. Resting Leg Rigidity Using the Pendulum Test Is Associated With a Fall History in People With Parkinson's Disease								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						602595	10.3389/fnhum.2020.602595			DEC 9 2020	2020	Leg rigidity is associated with frequent falls in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a potential role in functional balance and gait impairments. Changes in the neural state due to secondary tasks, e.g., activation maneuvers, can exacerbate (or "activate") rigidity, possibly increasing the risk of falls. However, the subjective interpretation and coarse classification of the standard clinical rigidity scale has prohibited the systematic, objective assessment of resting and activated leg rigidity. The pendulum test is an objective diagnostic method that we hypothesized would be sensitive enough to characterize resting and activated leg rigidity. We recorded kinematic data and electromyographic signals from rectus femoris and biceps femoris during the pendulum test in 15 individuals with PD, spanning a range of leg rigidity severity. From the recorded data of leg swing kinematics, we measured biomechanical outcomes including first swing excursion, first extension peak, number and duration of the oscillations, resting angle, relaxation index, maximum and minimum angular velocity. We examined associations between biomechanical outcomes and clinical leg rigidity score. We evaluated the effect of increasing rigidity through activation maneuvers on biomechanical outcomes. Finally, we assessed whether either biomechanical outcomes or changes in outcomes with activation were associated with a fall history. Our results suggest that the biomechanical assessment of the pendulum test can objectively quantify parkinsonian leg rigidity. We found that the presence of high rigidity during clinical exam significantly impacted biomechanical outcomes, i.e., first extension peak, number of oscillations, relaxation index, and maximum angular velocity. No differences in the effect of activation maneuvers between groups with clinically assessed low rigidity were observed, suggesting that activated rigidity may be independent of resting rigidity and should be scored as independent variables. Moreover, we found that fall history was more common among people whose rigidity was increased with a secondary task, as measured by biomechanical outcomes. We conclude that different mechanisms contributing to resting and activated rigidity may play an important yet unexplored functional role in balance impairments. The pendulum test may contribute to a better understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying motor symptoms in PD, evaluating the efficacy of treatments, and predicting the risk of falls.

Motor Deficits in the Ipsilesional Arm of Severely Paretic Stroke Survivors Correlate With Functional Independence in Left, but Not Right Hemisphere Damage								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						599220	10.3389/fnhum.2020.599220			DEC 9 2020	2020	Chronic stroke survivors with severe contralesional arm paresis face numerous challenges to performing activities of daily living, which largely rely on the use of the less-affected ipsilesional arm. While use of the ipsilesional arm is often encouraged as a compensatory strategy in rehabilitation, substantial evidence indicates that motor control deficits in this arm can be functionally limiting, suggesting a role for remediation of this arm. Previous research has indicated that the nature of ipsilesional motor control deficits vary with hemisphere of damage and with the severity of contralesional paresis. Thus, in order to design rehabilitation that accounts for these deficits in promoting function, it is critical to understand the relative contributions of both ipsilesional and contralesional arm motor deficits to functional independence in stroke survivors with severe contralesional paresis. We now examine motor deficits in each arm of severely paretic chronic stroke survivors with unilateral damage (10 left-, 10 right-hemisphere damaged individuals) to determine whether hemisphere-dependent deficits are correlated with functional independence. Clinical evaluation of contralesional, paretic arm impairment was conducted with the upper extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (UEFM). Ipsilesional arm motor performance was evaluated using the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), grip strength, and ipsilesional high-resolution kinematic analysis during a visually targeted reaching task. Functional independence was measured with the Barthel Index. Functional independence was better correlated with ipsilesional than contralesional arm motor performance in the left hemisphere damage group [JTHFT: [r((10)) = -0.73, p = 0.017]; grip strength: [r((10)) = 0.64, p = 0.047]], and by contralesional arm impairment in the right hemisphere damage group [UEFM: [r((10)) = 0.66, p = 0.040]]. Ipsilesional arm kinematics were correlated with functional independence in the left hemisphere damage group only. Examination of hemisphere-dependent motor correlates of functional independence showed that ipsilesional arm deficits were important in determining functional outcomes in individuals with left hemisphere damage only, suggesting that functional independence in right hemisphere damaged participants was affected by other factors.

The prevalence of stressful events before a TGA attack makes it hard to overlook these precipitating factors, given that stress has the potential to organically effect the brain. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was proposed as a possible cause decades ago. Being a regional phenomenon, CSD seems to affect every aspect of the micro-mechanism in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). Corresponding evidence regarding hemodynamic and morphological changes from TGA and CSD have been accumulated separately, but the resemblance between the two has not been systematically explored so far, which is surprising especially considering that CSD had been confirmed to cause secondary damage in the human brain. Thus, by deeply delving into the anatomic and electrophysiological properties of the CNS, the CSD-TGA model may render insights into the basic pathophysiology behind the facade of the enigmatic clinical presentation.

In the present work, a hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI system-achieved through a fusion of concurrently recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals-is used to overcome the limitations of uni-modality and to achieve higher tasks classification. Although the hybrid approach enhances the performance of the system, the improvements are still modest due to the lack of availability of computational approaches to fuse the two modalities. To overcome this, a novel approach is proposed using Multi-resolution singular value decomposition (MSVD) to achieve system- and feature-based fusion. The two approaches based up different features set are compared using the KNN and Tree classifiers. The results obtained through multiple datasets show that the proposed approach can effectively fuse both modalities with improvement in the classification accuracy.

In the present study, we focused on the specificity of the predictors by performing cross-analyses on the same dataset; i.e., we predicted spelling and maths skills based on reading predictors, reading based on maths predictors and so on. Results indicated that some predictors, such as the Orthographic Decision and the Arithmetic Facts tests, predicted reading, spelling and maths skills in similar ways, while others predicted different behaviors but only for a specific parameter, such as fluency but not accuracy (as in the case of RAN), and still others were specific for a single behavior (e.g., Visual-auditory Pseudo-word Matching test predicted only spelling skills). To interpret these results, we propose a novel model of learning skills separately considering factors in terms of competence, performance and acquisition (automatization). Reading, spelling and calculation skills would depend on the development of discrete and different abstract competences (accounting for the partial dissociations among learning disorders reported in the literature). By contrast, overlap among behaviors would be accounted for by defective acquisition in automatized responses to individual "instances"; this latter skill is item specific but domain independent. Finally, performance factors implied in task's characteristics (such as time pressure) may contribute to the partial association among learning skills. It is proposed that this new model may provide a useful base for interpreting the diffuse presence of comorbidities among learning disorders.

The present fMRI study employs independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate which empathy facet (Cognitive or Affective) shares resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and/or BOLD variability (rsBOLD) with IA. Healthy participants viewed an abstract nonsocial movie demonstrated to evoke strong rsFC in brain networks resembling rest (InScapes), and resultant rsFC and rsBOLD data were correlated with self-reported empathy and IA questionnaires. We demonstrate a bidirectional behavioral and neurobiological relationship between empathy and IA, depending on the type of empathy interrogated: Affective empathy and IA share both rsFC and rsBOLD, while Cognitive empathy and IA only share rsBOLD. Specifically, increased rsFC in the right inferior frontal operculum (rIFO) of a larger attention network was associated with increased vicarious experience but decreased awareness of inner body sensations. Furthermore, increased rsBOLD between brain regions of an interoceptive network was related to increased sensitivity to internal sensations along with decreased Affective empathy. Finally, increased rsBOLD between brain regions subserving a mentalizing network related to not only an improved ability to take someone's perspective, but also a better sense of mind-body interconnectedness. Overall, these findings suggest that the awareness of one's own internal body changes (IA) is related to the socioemotional ability of feeling and understanding another's emotional state (empathy) and critically, that this relationship is reflected in the brain's resting state neuroarchitecture. Methodologically, this work highlights the importance of utilizing rsBOLD as a complementary window alongside rsFC to better understand neurological phenomena. Our results may be beneficial in aiding diagnosis in clinical populations such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where participants may be unable to complete tasks or questionnaires due to the severity of their symptoms.

In this study, GABA was measured before and after 30 min of video game play within a voxel around the hippocampus. It was predicted that all participants would experience a decrease in GABA during gaming as a result of in-game rewards; and, those who were most competitive with the goal-directed spatial decision making game would display lower hippocampal GABA concentrations after gaming. Those who were not competitive, because they were too skilled or not skilled enough, would demonstrate higher hippocampal GABA concentrations after gaming. While there were no significant differences in hippocampal GABA before and after gaming for gamers and non-gamers alike, there was a significant quadratic regression between performance on a spatial working memory task and post-gaming hippocampal GABA concentrations.

Characterization of the Stages of Creative Writing With Mobile EEG Using Generalized Partial Directed Coherence								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						577651	10.3389/fnhum.2020.577651			DEC 7 2020	2020	Two stages of the creative writing process were characterized through mobile scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in a 16-week creative writing workshop. Portable dry EEG systems (four channels: TP09, AF07, AF08, TP10) with synchronized head acceleration, video recordings, and journal entries, recorded mobile brain-body activity of Spanish heritage students. Each student's brain-body activity was recorded as they experienced spaces in Houston, Texas ("Preparation" stage), and while they worked on their creative texts ("Generation" stage). We used Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC) to compare the functional connectivity among both stages. There was a trend of higher gPDC in the Preparation stage from right temporo-parietal (TP10) to left anterior-frontal (AF07) brain scalp areas within 1-50 Hz, not reaching statistical significance. The opposite directionality was found for the Generation stage, with statistical significant differences (p < 0.05) restricted to the delta band (1-4 Hz). There was statistically higher gPDC observed for the inter-hemispheric connections AF07-AF08 in the delta and theta bands (1-8 Hz), and AF08 to TP09 in the alpha and beta (8-30 Hz) bands. The left anterior-frontal (AF07) recordings showed higher power localized to the gamma band (32-50 Hz) for the Generation stage. An ancillary analysis of Sample Entropy did not show significant difference. The information transfer from anterior-frontal to temporal-parietal areas of the scalp may reflect multisensory interpretation during the Preparation stage, while brain signals originating at temporal-parietal toward frontal locations during the Generation stage may reflect the final decision making process to translate the multisensory experience into a creative text.

CMS-subtypes are diverse regarding exercise intolerance and muscular weakness, varying from mild symptoms to life-limiting forms with neonatal onset. Long-term follow-up studies on disease progression and treatment-response in pediatric patients are rare. Patients and Methods: We analyzed retrospective clinical and medication data in a cohort of 32 CMS-patients including the application of a standardized, not yet validated test (CMS-ST) to examine muscular strength and endurance in 21 patients at the last follow-up. Findings obtained in our cohort were compared with long-term follow-up studies of (adult) CMS-cohorts from the literature by considering the underlying molecular mechanisms. Outcomes of CMS-ST were compared to results of normal clinical assessment. Results: Thirty-two pediatric patients with defects in eight different CMS-genes were followed by a median time of 12.8 years. Fifty-nine percentage of patients manifested with first symptoms as neonates, 35% as infants. While 53% of patients presented a reduced walking distance, 34% were wheelchair-bound. Even under adequate therapy with pyridostigmine (PS) and 3,4-diaminopyridine, CHAT-mutations led to the progression of muscular weakness partly in combination with persistent respiratory and bulbar symptoms. RAPSN, CHRND, and CHRNB1 patients with neonatal manifestation, early respiratory problems, and bulbar symptoms showed a good and maintained treatment response. CHAT and CHRNE patients required higher PS dosages, whereas RAPSN patients needed a lower mean dosage at the last follow-up. The benefits of short-term medication and long-term progression of symptoms were highly dependent on the specific genetic defect. CMS-ST was carried out in 17/21 patients, determined affected muscle groups including bulbar and ocular symptoms, some of which were not reported by the patients. Conclusions: Our findings and comparison with the literature- suggest a better treatment-response and less severe progression of symptoms present in patients suffering from mutations in CMS-genes directly associated with receptor deficiency, while patients with defects leading to synaptopathy and presynaptic defects tend to have worse outcomes. Assessment of affected muscular groups and clinical symptoms by CMS-ST may be a useful tool for optimal therapeutic management of the patients, especially for future clinical studies.

It is unclear whether this association is the result of those that identify as a minority due to sexual orientation being more likely to use SCs, due to those that identify as transgender using SCs more, or both. Deconstructing this relationship will allow for targeted clinical advice and public health campaigns. Methods: Data from the 2015 and 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Study are utilized. In total, 31,279 youth were asked about their gender identity, sexual orientation, and SC use history. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models were completed to explore relevant associations. Results: Identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning was linked to SC use and continuing SC use. Similarly, identifying as transgender was linked to SC use and continuing use. Regression analyses showed no significant interactive effect; identifying as both LGBQ and transgender does not have a compounding effect on use likelihood. Conclusions: Both sexual orientation and gender identity contribute to the relationship between sexual minority status and SC use noted in extant literature. This relationship is hypothesized to be tied to increased exposure to discrimination, victimization, and social isolation. Thus, efforts to directly counsel LGBTQ patients about the dangers associated with SC use are warranted as well as social policy reforms to better protect and support members of the LGBTQ community.

Hepatitis C Virus Screening among Medicaid-Insured Individuals with Opioid Use Disorder across Substance Use Disorder Treatment Settings								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	2			258	263		10.1080/10826084.2020.1858106			DEC 5 2020	2020	Objective: Although the rapid increase in opioid use disorders (OUD) and concurrent increase in Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States is well-documented, little is known about HCV testing among high-risk populations. We examine patterns of HCV testing across OUD treatment settings for individuals with OUD in New York. Methods: Using 2014 New York Medicaid claims data, we identified OUD diagnosis, OUD treatment (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, other treatment (inpatient or outpatient non-medication-based psychosocial treatment, such as psychotherapy) and no treatment) utilization and HCV-testing status among beneficiaries. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with HCV screening across OUD treatment settings. Results: 79,764 individuals with OUD diagnoses were identified in 2014. The prevalence of HCV screening was 32.4%, 16.2%, 20.6%, 16.8%, and 18.1% for those receiving methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, other treatment, and no treatment, respectively. In the adjusted logistic regression, those receiving any OUD treatment had greater odds of being screened, with the highest odds among methadone clients. Conclusions: Engagement in medication for OUD is associated with increased HCV testing. Findings indicate the importance of access to medication-based treatment for OUD and a need to further improve HCV screening rates.

Objective: The study tested the efficacy of a version of the keepin' it REAL curriculum for middle school students that was culturally adapted for Mexico and renamed Mantente REAL. Methods: Students in 7th grade classrooms in four public schools participated in the study (N = 1,418, 49% female, mean age = 11.9). Using a clustered randomized design, two schools received the intervention and two served as a treatment-as-usual control group. Regular classroom teachers were trained to deliver the twelve-lesson Mantente REAL manualized curriculum. Parents provided active consent and students gave written assent to collect pretest and posttest questionnaire data, 7 months apart, at the beginning and end of the 2017-2018 academic year. We assessed the Mantente REAL intervention with general linear models adjusted for baseline, attrition, non-linear distributions, and school-level clustering. Results: Students who participated in Mantente REAL reported relatively less frequent use of alcohol and illicit drugs other than marijuana, compared to students in control schools. Males alone reported desirable intervention effects for marijuana use. These desirable effects were especially strong among students who reported higher initial levels of involvement in risky behaviors. Among students more at risk, both females and males receiving the program reported relative reductions in the frequency of use of alcohol and illicit drugs. Conclusions: These promising results within the Mexico-US border context support a further dissemination of the intervention and additional youth prevention research in the region.

However, it has also been shown that these cognitive control processes can be improved by training interventions, e.g., by training in task switching. Here, we applied an event-related potential (ERP) approach to identify whether a cognitive training improves task-preparatory processes such as updating of relevant task goals. To do so, we applied a pretest-training-posttest design with eight training sessions. Two groups of older adults were either trained in task switching (treatment group) or in performing single tasks (control group) and we compared their performance to a group of untrained younger adults. To foster cue updating in the treatment group, we applied a cue-based switching task in which the two task cues were randomly selected prior to target presentation so that participants had time to prepare for the upcoming task. In contrast, the control group also received task cues but those were redundant as only one task had to be performed. We also examined whether training in cue updating during task switching can be transferred to a similar cognitive control task measuring updating of context information, namely a modified version of the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT). The results revealed training-specific improvements in task switching, that is, a larger improvement in blocks requiring switching in comparison to single tasks at the behavioral level. In addition, training specific-effects were also found at the neuronal level. Older adults trained in cue updating while switching showed a reduction in mixing costs in the cue-related P3, indicating an improvement in preparatory updating processes. Additionally, P3 topography changed with training from a very broad to a parietally focused scalp distribution similar to the one found in younger adults. However, we did not obtain training-specific improvements in context updating in the AX-CPT neither at the behavioral level nor at the neuronal level. Results are discussed in the context of the ongoing debate on whether transfer of cognitive training improvements is possible.

However, the underlying mechanisms and psychosocial factors that moderate this relationship have not been adequately delineated. Reinforcement theory, social learning theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the focus theory of normative conduct suggest that perceived behavioral control (PBC) over smoking cessation is a central mechanism that underlies the relationship between nicotine dependence and quitting intentions. Purpose/Objectives: The present study tested a moderated mediation model to examine the roles of PBC over smoking cessation and social norms, in the relationship between nicotine dependence and quit intentions among male regular smokers. Methods: Self-report measures of nicotine dependence, PBC over smoking cessation, descriptive and injunctive quitting norms, and intentions to quit smoking were administered to 204 Chinese male regular smokers. Results: Nicotine dependence was negatively related to quit intentions, and this relationship was mediated by PBC over smoking cessation. Further, the relationship between nicotine dependence and PBC was moderated by descriptive rather than injunctive quitting norms. The negative effects of nicotine dependence on PBC over smoking cessation were not significant among male regular smokers who reported strong descriptive quitting norms. Conclusions/Importance: Poor PBC over smoking cessation underlies the negative effects of nicotine dependence, and descriptive quitting norms act as a buffer against the adverse effects of nicotine dependence on PBC over smoking cessation. These findings have implications for smoking cessation interventions for male regular smokers.

Understanding its extent is complicated by concurrent misuse of other prescription or illicit drugs, increasing risk for overdose. Current surveillance using electronic medical records and police data has limitations and frequently fails to distinguish middle-aged adults from other age groups in reporting. Objectives: The purpose of this analysis is to (1) describe characteristics of middle-aged US adults who report misusing prescription and illicit drugs and (2) evaluate if misusing prescription opioids increases risk of misusing other drugs. Methods: We analyzed data from 12,300 adults ages 32-42 from Wave V of the Add Health study collected from 2016 to 2018. Self-reported past 30-day misuse of prescription sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, and opioids as well as cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, heroin, and other illicit drugs were analyzed for associations with demographic characteristics in weighted bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Those misusing prescription opioids were more likely to misuse prescription sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants compared to those not misusing prescription opioids. Those misusing prescription opioids were also more likely to misuse heroin, crystal meth, cocaine, and other illicit drugs. Higher levels of education and personal income were protective for prescription opioid misuse, any prescription drug misuse, and any illicit drug misuse. Race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with prescription opioid misuse. Conclusions/Importance: Our analysis shows those misusing prescription opioids are at high risk of misusing other prescription and illicit drugs. Practitioners and researchers should consider concurrent drug misuse when treating and studying opioid misuse disorders.

In this study, we analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a cross-sectional sample (198 healthy Chinese) using an automated segmentation tool to delineate the development of the hippocampal subregions from 6 to 26 years of age. We also examined whether gender and hemispheric differences influence the development of these subregions. For the whole hippocampus, the trajectory of development was observed to be an inverse-u. A significant increase in volume with age was found for most of the subregions, except for the L/R-parasubiculum, L/R-fimbria, and L-HATA. Gender-related differences were also found in the development of most subregions, especially for the hippocampal tail, CA1, molecular layer HP, GC-DG, CA3, and CA4, which showed a consistent increase in females and an early increase followed by a decrease in males. A comparison of the average volumes showed that the right whole hippocampus was significantly larger, along with the R-presubiculum, R-hippocampal-fissure, L/R-CA1, and L/R-molecular layer HP in males in comparison to females. Additionally, the average volume of the right hemisphere was shown to be significantly larger for the hippocampal tail, CA1, molecular layer HP, GC-DG, CA3, and CA4. However, for the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and fimbria, the left side was shown to be larger. In conclusion, the hippocampal subregions appear to develop in various ways from childhood to adulthood, with both gender and hemispheric differences affecting their development.

Nevertheless, the existence of effector-specific regions and activation patterns that would differentiate manual vs. oculomotor response inhibition remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the brain dynamics supporting these two response effectors with the same IC task paradigm. We examined the behavioral performance and electrophysiological activity in a group of healthy young people (n = 25) with a Go/NoGo task using the index finger for the manual modality and the eyes for the oculomotor modality. By computing topographic analysis of variance, we found significant differences between topographies of scalp recorded potentials of the two response effectors between 250 and 325 ms post-stimulus onset. The source estimations localized this effect within the left precuneus, a part of the superior parietal lobule, showing stronger activity in the oculomotor modality than in the manual modality. Behaviorally, we found a significant positive correlation in response time between the two modalities. Our collective results revealed that while domain-general IC processes would be engaged across different response effectors in the same IC task, effector-specific activation patterns exist. In this case, the stronger activation of the left precuneus likely accounts for the increased demand for visual attentional processes in the oculomotor Go/NoGo task.

Such cognitively capable children are ideal candidates for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). While BCI systems are rapidly evolving, a fundamental gap exists between technological innovators and the patients and families who stand to benefit. Forays into translating BCI systems to children in recent years have revealed that kids can learn to operate simple BCI with proficiency akin to adults. BCI could bring significant boons to the lives of many children with severe physical impairment, supporting their complex physical and social needs. However, children have been neglected in BCI research and a collaborative BCI research community is required to unite and push pediatric BCI development forward. To this end, the pediatric BCI Canada collaborative network (BCI-CAN) was formed, under a unified goal to cooperatively drive forward pediatric BCI innovation and impact. This article reflects on the topics and discussions raised in the foundational BCI-CAN meeting held in Toronto, ON, Canada in November 2019 and suggests the next steps required to see BCI impact the lives of children with severe neurological disease and their families.

Over the years, an increasingly structurally and functionally resolved "persuasion network" has emerged. However, current studies have only identified a small handful of neural structures that are commonly recruited during persuasive message processing, and the extent to which these (and other) structures are sensitive to numerous individual difference factors remains largely unknown. In this project we apply a multi-dimensional similarity-based individual differences analysis to explore which individual factors-including characteristics of messages and target audiences-drive patterns of brain activity to be more or less similar across individuals encountering the same anti-drug public service announcements (PSAs). We demonstrate that several ensembles of brain regions show response patterns that are driven by a variety of unique factors. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for neural models of persuasion, prevention neuroscience and message tailoring, and methodological implications for future research.

Prefrontal Cortex and Amygdala Subregion Morphology Are Associated With Obesity and Dietary Self-control in Children and Adolescents								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						563415	10.3389/fnhum.2020.563415			DEC 3 2020	2020	A prefrontal control system that is less mature than the limbic reward system in adolescence is thought to impede self-regulatory abilities, which could contribute to poor dietary choices and obesity. We, therefore, aimed to examine whether structural morphology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC; involved in cognitive control) and the amygdala (a key brain region for reward-related processing) are associated with dietary decisions and obesity in children and adolescents. Seventy-one individuals between the ages of 8-22 years (17.35 +/- 4.76 years, 51% female, 56% were overweight or obese) participated in this study; each participant completed a computer-based food choice task and a T1- and T2-weighted structural brain scans. Two indices of obesity were assessed, including age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMIz) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The behavioral task included rating 60 food stimuli for tastiness, healthiness, and liking. Based on each participant's self-ratings, 100 binary food choices were then made utilizing a computer mouse. Dietary "self-control" was calculated as the proportion of trials where the individual chose the healthier food item (vs. the tastier food item) over the total number of trials. Cortical thickness and amygdala subnuclei volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer 6.0 and CIT168 atlas, respectively. We found that WHtR was negatively associated with the thickness of bilateral superior frontal, left superior temporal, right insula, and right inferior temporal regions (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). We also found WHtR to be positively associated with the volume of the central nucleus (CEN) region of the amygdala (p = 0.006), after adjusting for the hemisphere, age, sex, and intracranial volumes. A similar data pattern was observed when BMIz was used. Moreover, we found that across all participants, thinner right superior frontal cortex and larger left CEN volumes predicted lower dietary self-control. These results suggest that differential development of the PFC and amygdala relate to obesity and dietary self-control. Further longitudinal studies are merited to determine causal relationships among altered PFC to amygdala neural circuitry, dietary self-control, and obesity.

Method: We conducted secondary analyses of biennial data collected from 11th graders who participated in the Student Wellness Survey (SWS) in 36 Oregon counties from 2010 to 2018 (N = 71,870). Multi-level logistic regression analyses assessed changes in past-30-day co-use of alcohol and marijuana, and alcohol- and marijuana-related beliefs after RML in counties with low, medium, and high densities of licensed recreational marijuana and alcohol retail outlets. We used post-RML 2016 and 2018 SWS data to examine whether beliefs accounted for any relationship of recreational marijuana and alcohol outlet density with alcohol and marijuana co-use. Results: We found a significant post-RML increase in past-30-day alcohol and marijuana co-use in 2016 in counties with the highest density of recreational marijuana and alcohol retail outlets. There were significant post-RML increases in perceived risk and parent approval of alcohol and marijuana use. Analyses with 2016 and 2018 SWS data indicated that the relationship between level of recreational marijuana and alcohol retail outlet density and past-30-day alcohol and marijuana co-use was accounted for beliefs about marijuana and alcohol availability, approval by parents, and risk. Conclusion: RML and greater retail availability of recreational marijuana and alcohol were positively associated with alcohol and marijuana co-use among adolescents, and with beliefs favorable to alcohol and marijuana use.

The magnitude of the N- and P-waves are used as a semi-objective measure of the response to the painful stimulus: the higher the magnitude, the more painful the stimulus has been perceived. The strength of the N-P-wave response is also largely dependent on the chosen reference electrode site. The goal of this study was to examine which reference technique excels both in practical and theoretical terms when analyzing noxious contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPS) in the amplitude-time spectrum. We recruited 21 subjects (10 male, 11 female, mean age of 55.79 years). We applied seven noxious contact heat stimuli using two temperatures, 51 degrees C, and 54 degrees C, to each subject. During EEG analysis, we aimed to identify the referencing technique which produces the highest N-wave and P-wave amplitudes with as little artifactual influence as possible. For this purpose, we applied the following six referencing techniques: mathematically linked A1/A2 (earlobes), average reference, REST, AFz, Pz, and mathematically linked PO7/PO8. We evaluated how these techniques impact the N-P amplitudes of CHEPS based on our data from healthy subjects. Considering all factors, we found that mathematically linked earlobes to be the ideal referencing site to use when displaying and evaluating CHEPS in the amplitude-time spectrum.

Purpose: This work aims to identify the functional connectivity in both the WM and the GM of patients with MS using fMRI and the correlations between these functional changes and cumulative disability as well as the lesion ratio. Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, 37 patients with clinically definite MS and 43 age-matched healthy controls were included between 2010 and 2014. Resting-state fMRI was performed. The WFU Pick and JHU Eve atlases were used to define 82 GM and 48 WM regions in common spaces, respectively. The time courses of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were averaged over each GM or WM region. The averaged time courses for each pair of GM and WM regions were correlated. All 82 x 48 correlations for each subject formed a functional correlation matrix. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the MS patients had a decreased temporal correlation between the WM and the GM regions. Five WM bundles and four GM regions had significantly decreased mean correlation coefficients (CCs). More specifically, the WM functional alterations were negatively correlated with the lesion volume in the bilateral fornix, and the mean GM-averaged CCs of the WM bundles were inversely correlated with the lesion ratio (r = -0.36, P = 0.012). No significant correlation was found between WM functional alterations and the paced auditory serial addition test score, Expanded Disease Severity Scale score, and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) in MS. Conclusions: These findings highlight current gaps in our knowledge of the WM functional alterations in patients with MS and may link WM function with pathological mechanisms.

Although several studies have demonstrated that patients with hypochondriasis demonstrate abnormalities in brain structure and function, gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) in hypochondriasis still remain unclear. Methods: The present study collected T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images from 21 hypochondriasis patients and 22 well-matched healthy controls (HCs). We first analyzed the difference in the GMV between the two groups. We then used the regions showing a difference in GMV between two groups as seeds to perform functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was applied to the imaging data to distinguish hypochondriasis patients from HCs. Results: Compared with the HCs, the hypochondriasis group showed decreased GMV in the left precuneus, and increased GMV in the left medial frontal gyrus. FC analyses revealed decreased FC between the left medial frontal gyrus and cuneus, and between the left precuneus and cuneus. A combination of both GMV and FC in the left precuneus, medial frontal gyrus, and cuneus was able to discriminate the hypochondriasis patients from HCs with a sensitivity of 0.98, specificity of 0.93, and accuracy of 0.95. Conclusion: Our study suggests that smaller left precuneus volumes and decreased FC between the left precuneus and cuneus seem to play an important role of hypochondriasis. Future studies are needed to confirm whether this finding is generalizable to patients with hypochondriasis.

We surveyed electronic dance music (EDM) partygoers-a population known for high levels of drug use-to determine whether their drug use patterns had changed during state-mandated social distancing in New York. Methods: Individuals were recruited online and screened for eligibility throughout April and May 2020. We surveyed 128 eligible adults and queried, retrospectively, whether their drug use behavior had changed during COVID-19-related social distancing. Results: Most participants reporting past-three-month use reported decreased frequency of use during COVID-19-related social distancing. Specifically, 78.6% reduced frequency of use of cocaine, 71.1% reduced frequency of use of ecstasy/MDMA/Molly, and 68.0% reduced frequency of use of LSD. Although some participants reported increased frequency of use of cocaine (7.1%), ecstasy (7.9%), or LSD (12.0%), 35.0% reported increased frequency of cannabis use. Most (66.7%) of those reporting cocaine use reduced the amount used. The majority of those reporting use of cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, and/or LSD reported that drug cost (80.0-84.0%) and drug quality (84.2-92.0%) did not change during social distancing. Having a college degree was associated with higher odds for decreasing frequency of cannabis use. Older participants (ages >= 23) were at lower odds for decreasing frequency of cocaine use, as were those earning >$500 per week, and participants who attended EDM events biweekly or more often were at higher odds for decreasing frequency of LSD use. Conclusions: Participants in this sample tended to reduce party drug use during COVID-19-related social distancing.

These vulnerable individuals, however, do not seek receive or seek help from mental health services. Telephone-based psychosocial interventions are potential strategies in augmenting mental health care in such persons. Methods: We aim to compare the efficacy of telephone-based psychosocial interventions (TBPI) with routine telephone reminders in persons with recent suicide attempts using a multi-site, parallel group, rater-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial design in 362 participants. In the first group, participants will receive three sessions of TBPI comprising of brief supportive interventions, problem-solving strategies, and reminders for adherence to prescribed mental health treatment at weekly intervals. In the second group, participants will receive three telephone reminders for adherence to prescribed mental health treatment at weekly intervals. We will follow up participants for 6 months. Primary outcomes are suicidal ideation scores on Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation and number of repeat suicide attempts. Secondary outcomes are scores on Beck's Hopelessness Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and Visual Analogue Rating Scales for acceptability of interventions. Outcomes will be assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after receiving telephone interventions or reminders. Results: The trial is currently underway after prospective registration under Clinical Trials Registry of India and has recruited 260 participants till August 15, 2020. Conclusion: This study has potential to generate evidence on additional strategies for use along with standard mental health treatments in management of high-risk suicide behaviors.

Hence, a community level intervention program addressing the issue is proposed. Materials and Methods: Patients with severe mental illnesses will be identified by a door-to-door survey and assessed for comorbid physical illnesses like anemia, hypertension, diabetes, and so on. They will then be randomized into two groups. The treatment as usual (TAU) group will not receive intervention from the trained community level workers, while the Intervention group will receive it. Results: The two groups will be compared for the prevalence and severity of comorbid physical illnesses. The expected outcome is compared to the TAU group, the intervention group will have a greater reduction in the morbidity due to physical illnesses and improved mental health. Conclusion: If successful, the module can be incorporated into the community level mental health delivery system of the District Mental Health Program (DMHP).

There is a need to develop low-intensity psychosocial interventions applicable to obstetric health care facilities. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a brief psychological intervention for mild to moderate PD delivered by a nurse as compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Methods: This study is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicentric trial being conducted in four sites of India. A total of 816 pregnant women with mild to moderately severe depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9 score of 5-19) are being assessed for the effectiveness of the intervention. Participants are randomly allocated to two groups of trial intervention (psychological intervention given by nurse) and TAU. The primary outcome is to compare the proportion of women reporting improvement across both groups. Participants are serially followed-up in each trimester and at 6, 10, 14 weeks, and 6 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes include pregnancy outcomes, feeding practices, physical growth, and immunization status of the infants. Conclusion: It is a prospective pregnancy birth cohort with a robust design and long-term follow-up. This is one of the largest studies utilizing non-specialist health workers for the screening and management of PD.

Naveen; Basavarajappa, Chethan								Community-Based Rehabilitation for Persons with Severe Mental Illness in a Rural Community of Karnataka: Methodology of a Randomized Controlled Study								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	6_SUPPL			S73	S79		10.1177/0253717620971203			DEC 2020	2020	Background: Task shifting has been recommended as a strategy to reach out to persons with mental illness and bridge the treatment gap. There is a need to explore task-shifting using existing health staff like Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). Aim and Context: ASHAs are involved in ongoing community-based rehabilitation (CBR) program run with a public-private partnership over the last 5 years at Jagaluru Taluk (an administrative block) in Davanagere district (Karnataka, India). This article aims to summarize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine whether CBR delivered by ASHAs is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) control group in reducing disability associated with severe mental illness (SMI). Method: A group of proactive ASHAs is already working with us for a follow-up of persons with SMI. For the study, we would allocate areas that are currently not being covered proactively by ASHAs randomly in a 1:1 ratio via computer-generated randomization list to receive either ASHAs delivered CBR arm or TAU control group. A sample size of about 100 in each arm is enough to identify an effect size of 0.5 in total IDEAS score between the intervention and control arms with a power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05. We use the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement to describe the methods of the trial. Result: The study has been approved by the institute ethics committee and registered with CTRI (CTRI/2019/08/020585 dated 6th August 2019). The recruitment of subjects is ongoing. The patients will be followed up for 1 year and assessed. The trial is funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Government of India. Discussion: The results of the study will be helpful from a public health perspective in delivering cost-effective and replicable CBR for persons with SMI through ASHAs. If the model turns successful, this could be expanded throughout the state/country. This would go a long way in bridging the huge treatment gap.

Serious mental illness (SMI) is a subset of the mental disorders that result in significant functional impairment and is usually long term. Persons with SMI face several challenges in their old age that are different from the issues faced by younger people with SMI. Understanding the problems faced by elderly individuals suffering from SMI is fundamental for planning programs to address them. The SENIOR (Support Systems Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Illness in Old age) project is a study aimed at evaluating the problems faced in obtaining mental health care by elderly persons having SMI in the Kerala state of India. Aim: To describe the scientific methodology of the SENIOR project. Methods: This study employs mixed-methods cross-sectional design among a minimum sample of 768 SMI patients identified through cluster sampling from three districts, and Focus Group Discussion among mental health program officials. Discussion: This paper presents a methodological model to assist researchers in future field epidemiological studies on mental illness. Assessing service needs and barriers to access for the most vulnerable among the mentally ill will help the policymakers make evidence-based decisions to improve their quality of life.

Effectiveness of Psychological Intervention by Videoconference for Family Members with Depression of Farmers Who Have Committed Suicide								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	6_SUPPL			S46	S50		10.1177/0253717620972917			DEC 2020	2020	Background: In India two thirds of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. The suicide rate for farmers throughout the world is higher than the non-farming population with India being no exception. Family members of the household where a member has committed suicide are at an increased risk for depression, anxiety and suicide. There is a paucity of trained counsellors in India, while there is sufficient research showing counselling and therapy through videoconferencing is just as effective as in-person therapy. It is however, not commonly practiced in India, especially in rural settings. We propose to evaluate psychiatric morbidity and assess feasibility and effectiveness of videoconferencing for family members of farmers who had committed suicide. Objectives: The objective is to evaluate family members of farmers who have committed suicide for psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial risk factors. We aim to identify depression, anxiety and suicidal risk in family members and then administer psychological intervention through video-conferencing for depression to study its effectiveness in the cohort. Methodology: The data on completed farmer suicide would be collected from district authorities and police departments. Home visit would be made by research staff to assess the risk factors for the farmers who completed suicide. Family members would be screened for anxiety and depression and severity of depression and suicidal ideas would be rated. The family members having mild to moderate depression would be randomised and CBT based psychological intervention (5 sessions) over three months would be given by trained psychologist through videoconferencing. The outcome would be measured at the end of six months. Conclusions: Psychological interventions through video-conference might be beneficial in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in family members of the farmers who have committed suicide.

Despite constituting 8.6% of the Indian population, tribals are among the most geographically isolated, socioeconomically underdeveloped, and underserved communities in the country. Based on the experience from our centers (in Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya, and Gujarat), we are aware of escalating alcohol use among tribal communities. The aims of this study are (a) to estimate alcohol use and psychiatric morbidity among teenagers from indigenous tribes, and (b) pilot test a psychoeducational efficacy study. Methods: The biphasic study is being conducted in three states of India: Tamil Nadu in South, Meghalaya in Northeast, and Gujarat in West. Phase 1 is a cross-sectional study of tribal adolescents at each site. The MINI 6.0/MINI Kid 6.0 questionnaire was used to estimate extent of psychiatric morbidity and substance addiction. Phase 2 is an intervention trial of 40 participants at each site to assess the effectiveness of NIMHANS LSE module in protecting the tribal adolescents from alcohol use. Conclusions: The desired primary outcome will be forestalling the onset of alcohol use among this group. This paper focuses on the methodology and strategies to be used to achieve the objectives.

In order to provide reliable data and evidence for NMHP, there is a strong requirement of a comprehensive system for integrative collection, storage, and analysis of data generated by this program. Methods: Data collection tools, questionnaires, instruments, and scales provided by the National Coordinating Unit were digitized using the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) framework (version 2.30). The rules for data validation and automated scoring were implemented as per the scales. The developed system (i-MANN, ICMR-Mental Health Assessment National Network) is based on modular architecture with role-based access to data input forms and dashboards. Results: The data are stored on a centralized server at ICMR. i-MANN captures data on basic and advanced demographic details followed by category specific forms from 15 multicentric ICMR-funded projects. Data collection module is divided into 12 categories containing 93 scales/instruments with built-in validation rules, scoring patterns, and indicators. As of August 2020, the system contains 17,690 records. Conclusions: i-MANN is the first web-based, modular, robust, and extendable system for collection, integration, management, and analysis of data on mental health in India.

Protocol for Development of the Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire: The Screening Version of the Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	6_SUPPL			S63	S67		10.1177/0253717620969068			DEC 2020	2020	Introduction: Autism is included as a certifiable disability in the Indian Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016. The Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA), developed by the Government of India and mandated for certifying disability, is a detailed instrument that needs trained mental health experts and takes time to administer. The current project was planned to develop a simple, easy to use screening tool based on the ISAA to identify possible cases in the community. Methods: The project is planned in three phases. During the first phase, data collected during the development of the ISAA (N = 433/436 children with autism) will be used to identify questions answered as frequently, mostly, and always. During the second phase, the psychometric properties of the screening tool based on these items will be evaluated among research participants recruited from hospitals and special schools (n = 100). In the third phase, the screening questionnaire will be administered in the community (n = 500). Results: The most frequently answered questions will be selected for inclusion in the proposed screening tool. The number of items in the screening tool will be kept as few as possible, with yes or no responses Discussion: Indian Autism Screening Questionnaire (IASQ) will be tested as a screening version of ISAA, which can be used by community health workers, teachers, or school counselors. The IASQ will not provide a diagnosis of autism. A positive screening result should be followed by a thorough assessment by a trained specialist. Analyzing the psychometric properties of the test can help ensure cost-effective screening of the community to identify autism.

The differences in the patient outcomes can be inferred upon by looking into the process and content of service delivery. Methods: This study is a mixed-methods, prospective cohort study to be conducted at two community extension clinics run by the Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi, Jharkhand. Service users diagnosed with a common mental disorder (CMDs) will be recruited during the study period of three years. The main objective is to ascertain the unmet needs of patients with CMDs. The secondary goals involve measuring the clinical outcome through the lens of process-oriented recovery, service satisfaction, and accessibility, and analyzing the barriers to access healthcare services along with the impact on the carers. Focus group discussions with participants will help understand the reasons behind their unmet needs and factors essential in service delivery. Discussion: Healthcare, as well as social care, aims to deliver services according to need. In a country with 15 million people with CMDs, evaluation of needs could create a platform for the rational distribution of services.

Nine patients and eleven family caregivers have been included in this study. Quantitatively, it was found that Music Care was significantly more effective against existential suffering than relaxation. During the qualitative analysis, themes emerged relating to the ambivalent effects of Music Care as it was perceived by participants as filled with negative morbid connotations even though it brought meaning to their end of life experience.

Also, the associations of visual memory, evaluated by the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), and neural oscillation with FC during the resting state were investigated. The BD (n = 35) and non-BD (n = 35) groups were selected based on scores of the Korean version of the Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) Identification Test and the Alcohol Use Questionnaire. EEG was performed for 6 min while the participants rested with eyes closed. The theta, lower-alpha, and upper alpha powers did not differ between the BD and non-BD groups. Concerning FC, the BD group exhibited stronger theta coherence than that of the non-BD group, and in the lower and upper alpha bands, the BD group showed stronger coherence in some areas but weaker coherence in others compared with the non-BD group. However, these significant results were not observed after Bonferroni correction. The BD group showed significantly lower delayed recall scores on the RCFT than did the non-BD group. A positive correlation between the left prefrontal-parietal-occipital midline connection and performance on the delayed recall of the RCFT was observed in the BD group. The present results could suggest that binge drinkers have alterations in brain FC, which may be related to their visual memory deficits.

DEPRESsion Screening Data DEPRESSD						Probability of Major Depression Classification Based on the SCID, CIDI, and MINI Diagnostic Interviews: A Synthesis of Three Individual Participant Data Meta-Analyses								PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS				90	1			28	40		10.1159/000509283			DEC 2020	2020	Introduction: Three previous individual participant data meta-analyses (IPDMAs) reported that, compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID), alternative reference standards, primarily the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), tended to misclassify major depression status, when controlling for depression symptom severity. However, there was an important lack of precision in the results. Objective: To compare the odds of the major depression classification based on the SCID, CIDI, and MINI. Methods: We included and standardized data from 3 IPDMA databases. For each IPDMA, separately, we fitted binomial generalized linear mixed models to compare the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of major depression classification, controlling for symptom severity and characteristics of participants, and the interaction between interview and symptom severity. Next, we synthesized results using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. Results: In total, 69,405 participants (7,574 [11%] with major depression) from 212 studies were included. Controlling for symptom severity and participant characteristics, the MINI (74 studies; 25,749 participants) classified major depression more often than the SCID (108 studies; 21,953 participants; aOR 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.92]). Classification odds for the CIDI (30 studies; 21,703 participants) and the SCID did not differ overall (aOR 1.19; 95% CI 0.79-1.75); however, as screening scores increased, the aOR increased less for the CIDI than the SCID (interaction aOR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52-0.80). Conclusions: Compared to the SCID, the MINI classified major depression more often. The odds of the depression classification with the CIDI increased less as symptom levels increased. Interpretation of research that uses diagnostic interviews to classify depression should consider the interview characteristics.

We aimed to assess QOL in elderly without dementia living in nursing homes, and to examine the association between QOL and sociodemographic features, comorbidities, level of dependency, and depression. Method: We carried out a cross-sectional survey involving 42 old subjects living in Manouba nursing home. The Mini-mental state examination, the Geriatric depression scale, the Activity of daily living, the Cumulative illness rating scale-geriatric, and the 36-item Medical outcomes study short-form health survey-SF36 were used to assess cognitive functions, depression, level of dependency, comorbidities and QOL, respectively. Results: All dimensions of the physical and mental components of QOL were altered in our population, with an overall mean score of less than 66.7 for all domains. A significant correlation was found between the two physical and mental components of QOL and the level of dependency, depression scores as well as comorbidity scores. In the final model of hierarchical regression, which included demographic (age and gender), clinical (level of dependency and comorbidities), and psychosocial (depression and social support) variables, only social support was significantly associated with both QOL dimensions. Conclusion: Strengthening social support in institutions is strongly recommended, especially activities that promote interaction. When family members remain involved in the lives of their older relatives after institutionalization, policies such as family visits and the involvement of family members in the care provided should be strongly encouraged.

Burn-out of the Medical Oncology Health Care Professionals and Associated Factors in Tunisia								PSYCHO-ONCOLOGIE				14	4			207	216		10.3166/pson-2020-0134			DEC 2020	2020	Introduction: Burn-out is defined as a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and diminished self-achievement that affects individuals exposed to chronic occupational stress. Physicians and caregivers faced with the death of their patients, such as oncology, are particularly vulnerable to this syndrome. Objectives: To evaluate the burn-out of medical professionals in medical oncology, to research the predisposing factors and to analyze the functional complaints and the behavior of the staff associated with this syndrome. Methods: A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study among medical oncology professionals practicing in public hospitals in the Tunisian territory who exercise more than two years in oncology; with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results: Our study population was predominantly female (81%). 53% are doctors and 47% are paramedical health care professionals. A high degree of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal achievement were found in 63%, 53% and 59% in our population, respectively. With 21% global high burn-out. The female sex was associated with high emotional exhaustion and low personal accomplishment as well as global burn-out. This burn-out was attributed to factors associated with working conditions and professional climate, mainly: overwork, poor organization of service, lack of resources and time, lack of recognition, lack of communication, lack of respect, conflicts with colleagues, report unsatisfactory salary effort and aggressions by patients and their families. Functional complaints and health care professional's behavior associated with burn-out were: feelings of sadness, blockage, and irritability, sleep disorders, unexplained pain, epigastralgia, addictive behaviors, psychotropic consumption, suicidal thoughts, decreased performance and desire for a job transfer. Conclusions: By its impact on professionals, burn-out in medical oncology represents a major threat to the quality of health care. Its etiologies, although complex and intricate, are well known. Its prevention and its support are possible, but involve mobilization at all levels.

It is a complex psychic phenomenon dependent on both socio-cultural and individual factors. A working group has developed an AFSOS standard for caregivers with the aim of a better understanding of the dynamics of this process and to distinguish between "normal" grief and complicated grief. Through a clinical situation, we will observe the various factors of vulnerability and protection involved during the complex evolution of bereavement. We will propose avenues for reflection and actions to help the bereaved.		[Leplus-Habeneck, J.

Cognitive impairment (CI) is frequent in patients with CKD and affects 30% to 60% of patients treated by hemodialysis. The link between CKD and CI is explained by common risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, but also by CKD-specific risk factors through vascular, degenerative, and toxic mechanisms. In patients with non-dialyzed CKD, albuminuria is more strongly linked to CI occurrence than glomerular filtration rate. Vascular dementia is the main cause of CI in patients with CKD, but incidence of Alzheimer's disease has also been found higher in patients with end-stage of kidney disease than in the general population. Executive functions, orientation and attention are the most frequently affected cognitive domains in patients with CKD. Occurrence of CI in older patients with CKD could be prevented by controlling blood pressure or the use of anticoagulant drugs in case of atrial fibrillation, which is particularly frequent in patients with CKD, in order to prevent cerebrovascular lesions. Nephrological care could also influence the occurrence of neurological complications. Anticholinesterasic drugs and memantine should be used with caution in patients with CKD, because most of these drugs accumulates in case of low glomerular filtration rate. Due to the poor prognosis of patients with CI and end-stage of kidney disease treated by dialysis or kidney transplantation, a cognitive assessment should be proposed to older patients with severe CKD in order to discuss the initiation and the type of renal replacement therapy with both patients and caregivers.

In the semantic universe of patients, suffering refers to bodily degradation and vulnerability; pain materializes the presence of the disease and its diagnosis. Oncologists do not mention suffering. For them, pain is a sign of disease progression and an indicator of tolerance to treatment.

Procedure: ECHOCALG is an exploratory and comparative study combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Twenty-four women who had received a perinatal cancer diagnosis (75% had breast cancer, 25% had brain or colon cancer, Hodgkin or melanoma) completed the MAC44 scale and responded to a semi-structured clinical interview to identify the psychological adjustment to cancer. Eighteen of them responded to a semi-structured interview to identify the conditions of psychological adaptation to the disease, as well as the defense mechanisms used. The data were compared with that of a control group of nineteen women diagnosed with non-perinatal and non-metastatic breast cancer, aged less than 45. Results: Women diagnosed with perinatal cancer showed more difficulty adjusting to the disease than control women. Denial and avoidance are strongly correlated with a negative adjustment to cancer. The interviews showed at the start of treatment the presence of defense mechanisms such as denial and trivialization as well as a suspension of the process of psychological adaptation to the disease and the treatments. The distress of a mother is linked to the feeling of being unable to take care of the baby and to cope concomitantly with motherhood and illness, as well as difficulties related to sexuality and emotional and social support. Conclusion: Pregnancy and recent motherhood have an impact on the adjustment to cancer. Women with perinatal cancer show a negative adjustment and an important psychological distress linked to difficulties of mothering and physical and emotional consequences of treatment.

The main objective of our study was to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with overuse by antidepressants in this population. Methodology: Single-center, prospective, cross-sectional study carried out at the Bretonneau Day Hospital (HDJ) between December, 1st 2014 and May, 31 2015. Consecutive patients with >= 70 years of age, suffering from MATA (according to DSM IV criteria) and current prescription of antidepressant were eligible. Overuse was defined by off-label prescriptions or prescriptions beyond the recommended duration of treatment. It was assessed by the geritrician in charge and validated by an expert committee, blind from the geriatrician's assessment. Results: Fifty-four patients were included in the study (mean age 82.9 years (+/- 5.4), 70.4% of women, 60% with mild to moderate dementia). The main indication of antidepressant treatment was a major depressive episode (59.3%). The geriatrician could not deal with overuse for 10 cases (18.5%). Inter-rater agreement between geriatricians and expert committee was good (kappa coefficient 0.73 [0.5-0.95]). Finally 33 (61%) of these patients had overuse of antidepressants: 1/3 had an off-label prescription and 2/3 had an exceeded treatment duration. The only factor associated with this overuse was coprescription of psychotropic drugs (p=0.009). Conclusions: Antidepressant overuse is common in demented older outpatients, especially overuse due to exceeded treatment duration. It is significantly associated with coprescription with another psychotropic drug, suggesting that it fits into a more global problem of overuse in psychotropic drugs.

Practical Considerations Based on Expert Consensus								PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS				90	1			49	56		10.1159/000510738			DEC 2020	2020	Introduction: Clinical and laboratory studies demonstrate that placebo and nocebo effects influence various symptoms and conditions after the administration of both inert and active treatments. Objective: There is an increasing need for up-to-date recommendations on how to inform patients about placebo and nocebo effects in clinical practice and train clinicians how to disclose this information. Methods: Based on previous clinical recommendations concerning placebo and nocebo effects, a 3-step, invitation-only Delphi study was conducted among an interdisciplinary group of internationally recognized experts. The study consisted of open- and closed-ended survey questions followed by a final expert meeting. The surveys were subdivided into 3 parts: (1) informing patients about placebo effects, (2) informing patients about nocebo effects, and (3) training clinicians how to communicate this information to the patients. Results: There was consensus that communicating general information about placebo and nocebo effects to patients (e.g., explaining their role in treatment) could be beneficial, but that such information needs to be adjusted to match the specific clinical context (e.g., condition and treatment). Experts also agreed that training clinicians to communicate about placebo and nocebo effects should be a regular and integrated part of medical education that makes use of multiple formats, including face-to-face and online modalities. Conclusions: The current 3-step Delphi study provides consensus-based recommendations and practical considerations for disclosures about placebo and nocebo effects in clinical practice. Future research is needed on how to optimally tailor information to specific clinical conditions and patients' needs, and on developing standardized disclosure training modules for clinicians.

Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of 100 Tunisian patients followed at the Salah Azaiez Institute for histologically and non-metastatic endometrial or cervical cancer, with a follow-up greater than six months. We used the BIS and FSFI scale and got the personal and family history and various socio-demographic data of the patients. Results: In our study, 40% of patients had problems with their body image. The mean BIS score was 12.03 with extremes ranging from 0 to 30 with a standard deviation of 7.88. In univariate analysis, the absence of family support, the deterioration of the couple's relationship and the sexual relationship, the poor tolerance of the surgery and the uterovaginal brachytherapy were significantly associated with the deterioration of the body image. In multivariate analysis, low socioeconomic level was the independent protective factor of body image disorder and sexual dysfunction was the independent predictor of this disorder. Conclusions: One of the main obstacles in recognizing and managing this problem is the lack of communication between patients and their partners and with the healthcare team. Preventive strategies aimed at maintaining a positive body image in these women should be undertaken.

As such, the introduction of supportive care represents the archetype of a new "person-centred" approach and its characteristic needs. While the chronicity of the disease reflects advances in treatment, it also raises questions about a particularly long, cumbersome and painful treatment process for an aging and vulnerable population. In this perspective, the emergence of oncogeriatrics reflects the desire to personalize support and to take greater account of the specific needs of the elderly population. However, oncogeriatrics, a relatively new discipline, remains unstructured in the field. The dynamics of humanizing care inevitably come up against complex clinical situations, requiring reflection on its interest and limitations in its application. Thus, the purpose of this article is to propose an inventory of oncogeriatric care by raising a complex articulation between "theory of care" and "its implementation in the field".

Malnutrition in the elderly people is frequent and serious. Management of malnutrition at home after hospitalization is unsatisfactory. The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and participation of a new collaborative and participative program involving the patient, the general practitioner and the dietician nutritionist, to fight against malnutrition in the elderly people at home after hospitalization. Methods. This was a prospective and non-randomized study performed from May 2015 to February 2016, in subjects aged 75 and more, malnourished, with an MMSE score > 20 and returning homes after hospitalization. At home, a dietician worked with the patients and their general practitioner for 3 months. Patient participation and satisfaction of the 3 actors were assessed. Results. Forty-four patients were included and 11.9% (n=8) benefited from the entire program. Present entourage (p=0.001), dietary education to the entourage (p=0,003), a high MMSE score (p=0.04), having an ulcer (p=0.0097), and a high weight at discharge (p=0.03) increased patients' participation. Patients (78.6%) and general practitioners (75%) were satisfied with the program. Patients criticized the lack of involvement of the general practitioner. General practitioners felt they had not acquired any knowledge of dietetics. Conclusion. Patient participation and collaboration between actors of the program of management of malnutrition in elderly people were considered weak.

This qualitative exploratory study aims to a better understanding of the extent and nature of the difficulties experienced by the elderly in terms of prospective memory in real life, and reminders used by them. Semi-directive and directive interviews were conducted with 14 people over 66 of age and assessed by manual content analyzes. The results show disturbances of prospective memory expressed by the elderly, which differ according to the type of task and seem to be fitting with the results found in natural environment. They also show that external memory aids are more often used by older people even if they are considered by them to be less effective than the interns one. Our results give some insight into the reminders, which are spontaneously used or not used by the elderly and allow to look ahead to new perspectives in terms of memory rehabilitation.

The results focus on the deficit of levels of language production processing of bilingual patients with AD at the semantic level of the first language in two aspects, which are the procedure based on the lexical implications of the terms and the continuity. While the grammatical level seems rather affected in the second language (L2) and relatively spared in the first language (L1). Consequently, the cognitive-language stimulation protocol for bilingual patients with AD is developed to offer cognitive training adapted to this deficit. The present study aims at assessing the effectiveness of PSCLAB in the rehabilitation of disturbed levels of language production processing in bilingual patients with AD from early to medium stage, by analyzing the discourse of 30 bilingual patients before and after the administration of the protocol. The results of this study suggest a cognitive language training. The PSCLAB seems effective in the rehabilitation of disturbed levels of language production processing in these patients, although controlled studies with larger samples may be necessary in order to conclude to a therapeutic efficacy of this protocol.

GERIATRIE ET PSYCHOLOGIE NEUROPSYCHIATRIE DE VIEILLISSEMENT				18	4			371	376		10.1684/pnv.2020.0887			DEC 2020	2020	This article is about the development of complementary and alternative medicine in geriatrics. He questions the meaning of his practices - and more broadly that of relational and non-drug care - as well as their application in the field in the aging sector. Indeed, the promotion of non-drug therapies by the high health authority, the growing role of actors in relational care or the emergence of practices complementary attest to a new dynamic of care in favor of a more global approach to support. If this dynamic was initially deployed in oncology, through supportive care, other sectors - and in particular geriatrics -are opening up to these practices in a logic of personalization of care. As such, the establishment of centers of activity and adapted care reflects a new model of support specific to aging focused on the specific needs of people weakened by age and disease. This work responds to the need to better understand this field as a whole and to highlight the plural issues, societal or medical, scientific, in connection with the process of their integration in geriatrics.

It is most often due to digestive lesions, so we wonder the benefit-risk balance and yield of digestive explorations. The English recommendations recommend that bidirectional endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy) is performed at the same time, without any upper age limit. In studies conducted in people over 75 years of age, the yield of diagnostic varies between 63 and 68%, which is similar to that of younger people. There is about 40% of the upper lesion and 40% of the lower lesion. The simultaneous discovery of upper and lower digestive lesions represents about 10% of elderly patients. Complications of EGD are rare and mainly related to anaesthesia. The main complication of colonoscopy is perforation and there is a small oveivisk of perforation in older patients. This risk is less important when we use computed tomographic colonography. Contraindications of endoscopies are very rare. In case of negative endoscopies, we will wonder if we need further explorations or not.

PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS				90	1			57	63		10.1159/000509910			DEC 2020	2020	Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with high chronicity and treatment resistance, indicating the need for early therapy response markers enabling fast and personalized treatment adaptations. Although epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene have previously been linked to OCD pathogenesis, epigenetic markers as predictors of treatment success have not yet been investigated in OCD. Objective: For the first time, this therapyepigenetic study aimed to investigate the role of OXTR methylation as a treatment response marker in OCD. Methods: In total, 113 inpatients with OCD (57 females) were compared to 113 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were investigated over a 10-week course of standardized, OCD-specific cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. Clinical response was measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline, before in vivo exposure, and after therapy. OXTR exon III methylation was analyzed via direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA extracted from blood cells. Results: Relative OXTR hypermethylation was observed in OCD patients compared to healthy controls. In OCD, higher baseline OXTR methylation was found to predict impaired treatment response at both categorical (responders vs. nonresponders) and dimensional (relative Y-BOCS reduction) levels, whereas lower baseline methylation was related to treatment response and greater symptom improvements. Analysis of Y-BOCS subdimensions revealed that the association between OXTR hypermethylation with impaired treatment response applied especially to symptoms related to obsessions, but not compulsions. Conclusions: OXTR hypermethylation may constitute a predictive marker of impaired treatment response in OCD and thus carries great potential for future personalized treatment efforts in OCD.

We sent e-mail open questions to patients cared for at Curie Institute. We have coded the responses in 12 worries topics and 8 satisfactions topics before analysing them. Results: 90% of the 2,478 respondents were over 40 years old and 58.9% between 40 and 65. 51% were living in Paris. 61.4% were on treatment. Worries: They concerned health for 63.9% of respondents: cancer for 45.5% (with 9.8% about continuing the treatment and 5.7% about side effects). 18.1% were concerned by Covid-19. 16.6% worried about daily life (unusual life, work, money, housing, social climate) and 12.8% worried about loved ones (not seeing them, health, future) Satisfactions: 33.7% appreciated relationships with loved ones and 32% their life conditions (quality of life for 14.6%, having time for 10%, nature for 7.4%). 13.5% had satisfactions about illness: health for 7.3% and cure for 6.2%. Work satisfaction is rare (2.8%) Conclusion: Covid-19 was not the principal worry but emphasized cancer experience's polarities: on one side, fear about illness and treatment and on the other loved ones' support and daily life.

Objective: Using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database (March 2019-March 2020), we analysed esketamine-related adverse events (AEs) to detect and characterize relevant safety signals. Methods: We used the consolidated case/non-case approach to estimate the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) with relevant confidence intervals (95% CI) for esketamine-related AEs with >= 4 counts. Comparisons between serious and non-serious AEs were performed using non-parametric tests. Results: The FAERS database contained 962 cases of esketamine-related AEs, with signals detected for several AEs, such as dissociation (ROR = 1,612.64, 95% CI = 1,354.63, 1,919.79; IC = 8.19, 95% CI = 7.96, 8.35), sedation (ROR = 238.46, 95% CI = 202.98, 280.15; IC = 7, 95% CI = 6.75, 7.18), feeling drunk (ROR = 96.17, 95% CI = 61.42, 150.57; IC = 4.84, 95% CI = 4.09, 5.36), suicidal ideation (ROR = 24.03, 95% CI = 18.72, 30.84; IC = 4.31, 95% CI = 3.9, 4.61), and completed suicide (ROR = 5.75, 95% CI = 3.18, 10.41; IC = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.23, 2.94). Signals for suicidal and self-injurious ideation, but not suicide attempt and completed suicide, remained when comparing esketamine to venlafaxine. Females and patients receiving antidepressant polypharmacy, co-medication with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, or somatic medications were more likely to suffer from serious versus non-serious AEs (chi(2) = 125.29, p < 0.001, chi(2) = 9.08, p = 0.003, chi(2) = 8.14, p = 0.004, chi(2) = 19.48, p < 0.001, chi(2) = 25.62, p < 0.001, and chi(2) = 16.79, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Esketamine may carry a clear potential for serious AEs, which deserves urgent clarification by means of further prospective studies.

While these deficits may be detected using classic clinical tests or even from simple observation, experimental tools enable a more precise evaluation of these deficits, typically by subtracting between conditions which vary the quantity of necessary attention, and by recording response times which allow a more precise and modulated measurement. The sensitivity of these tools can be further increased by analyzing the intra-individual variability of performance in these experiments, this variability being particularly important during the earliest stages of the disease. We present the cognitive aspects of these deficits by regrouping them according to the type of experiment used to highlight each deficit. Thus, we distinguish deficits of spatial attention orientation, of executive control and of sustained attention. In each section we present several of the more often employed experiments (spatial cueing, spatial search, dual-tasks, conflict tasks, vigilance tests), and draw a parallel between these experiments and everyday life.

However, it is not clear whether this age-related positivity effect relies on an increase in positive information memory and/or on a decrease in negative information memory. Thus, we aimed to study the specific mechanisms underlying the age-related positivity effect in different memory tasks. To do so, we used an emotional word memory paradigm including immediate free recall, recognition and delayed free recall tasks. Forty-five young adults (m = 20.0 years) and 45 older adults (m = 69.2 years) native French speakers participated. Thirty-six low French words, including 12 negative (e.g. egout), 12 positive (e.g. lagune) and 12 neutral (e.g. notion) words were selected from an emotional lexical database (Gobin et al. 2017). For the recognition task, 36 new words were selected. The results showed that the age-related positivity effect specifically depended on a decrease in negativity preference (i.e. the comparison between negative and neutral words) in older adults, in comparison with young adults, both in immediate and delayed free recall tasks. Indeed, in these tasks, young adults recalled more negative than neutral words whereas there was no difference in older adults. In recognition task, no age-related positivity effect has been observed. Moreover, the results showed that, in immediate recall, the higher the older adults memory abilities, the lower their negativity preference. This correlation was not significant in delayed recall. These results suggest that, when compared with young adults, older adults disengage from negative words processing through costly cognitive processes. A small magnitude of negativity preference would indicate good maintenance of memory abilities. Results are discussed in the framework of the socioemotional selectivity theory.

Collinear facilitation and contour integration in autistic adults: Examining lateral and feedback connectivity								VISION RESEARCH				177				56	67		10.1016/j.visres.2020.08.004			DEC 2020	2020	Alongside difficulties with communication and social interaction, autism is often accompanied by unusual sensory and perceptual experiences including enhanced visual performance on tasks that involve separating local parts from global context. This superiority may be the result of atypical integrative processing, involving feedback and lateral connections between visual neurons. The current study investigated the integrity of these connections in autistic adults by examining two psychophysics tasks that rely on these processes - collinear facilitation and contour integration. The relative contribution of feedback and lateral connectivity was studied by altering the timing of the target relative to the flankers in the collinear facilitation task, in 16 autistic and 16 non-autistic adults. There were no significant differences in facilitation between the autistic and non-autistic groups, indicating that for this task and participant sample, lateral and feedback connectivity appear relatively intact in autistic individuals. Contour integration was examined in a different group of 20 autistic and 18 nonautistic individuals, for open and closed contours to assess the closure effect (improved detection of closed compared to open contours). Autistic individuals showed a reduced closure effect at both short (150 ms) and longer (500 ms) stimulus presentation durations that was driven by better performance of the autistic group for the open contours. These results suggest that reduced closure in a simple contour detection paradigm is unlikely to be due to slower global processing. Reduced closure has implications for understanding sensory overload by contributing to reduced figure-ground segregation of salient visual features.

Whether LSF priming affects low- or high-level mechanisms of contextual influence remains to be clarified. By using the Ebbinghaus illusion, which is a classic example of context-dependent size perception, we reduced the lightness contrast of surrounding inducers relative to the background and the shape similarity of the central target and surrounding inducers to diminish or eliminate low-level contour interaction and high-level size contrast, respectively. The results showed that LSF-related enhancement of context influence was unaffected by a change to the surround elements' contrast but not by a change to the shape similarity between the target and surround. The findings provide evidence that LSF priming primarily affects high-level rather than low-level mechanisms of contextual influence, possibly by weakening the suppressive function of feedback connections from higher visual regions to the early visual cortex.

J	Mishra, Pallavi; Helie, Sebastien								3D shape estimation in a constraint optimization neural network								VISION RESEARCH				177				118	129		10.1016/j.visres.2020.08.010			DEC 2020	2020	One of the most important aspects of visual perception is the inference of 3D shape from a 2D retinal image of the outside world. The existence of several valid mapping functions from object to data makes this inverse problem ill-posed and therefore computationally difficult. In human vision, the retinal image is a 2D projection of the 3D world. The visual system imposes certain constraints on the family of solutions in order to uniquely and efficiently solve this inverse problem. This work specifically focused on the minimization of standard deviations of 3D angles (MSDA) for 3D perception. Our goal was to use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on biological principles derived from visual area V4 to achieve 3D reconstruction using constrained minimization of MSDA. We conducted an experiment using novel shapes with human subjects to collect data and test the model. The performance of the network largely agreed with how humans estimated novel 3D shapes. The results show that the constraint of MSDA in 3D shape can be implemented in a neural network and produce human-like results. Additional visual constraints can be added to the network in the future to fully test the theory of visual constraints as a basis of 3D shape perception.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of eccentricity on the ability of myopic defocus signals to influence central refractive development in infant monkeys. From 24 to 152 days of age, rhesus monkeys were reared with binocular, dual-focus lenses that had central, zero-powered zones surrounded by alternating concentric annular power zones of + 3D and zero power. Between subject groups the diameter of the central, zero-powered zone was varied from 2 mm to 8 mm in 2 mm steps (+3D/pl 2 mm, n = 6; + 3D/pl 4 mm, n = 6; + 3D/pl 6 mm, n = 8, or + 3D/pl 8 mm, n = 6). For the treatment lens with 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm central zones, objects at eccentricities beyond 11 degrees, 16 degrees, 19 degrees and 23 degrees, respectively, were imaged exclusively through the dual-power peripheral zones. Refractive status (retinoscopy), corneal power (keratometry) and axial dimensions (ultrasonography) were measured at two-week intervals. Comparison data were obtained from monkeys reared with binocular, single-vision + 3D full-field lenses (+ 3D FF, n = 6) and 41 normal control monkeys reared with unrestricted vision. At the end of the rearing period, with the exception of the +3D/pl 8 mm group (median = + 3.64 D), the ametropias for the other lens-reared groups (medians: FF = + 4.39 D, 2 mm = + 5.19 D, 4 mm = + 5.59 D, 6 mm = + 3.50 D) were significantly more hyperopic than that for the normal monkeys ( + 2.50 D). These hyperopic errors were associated with shallower vitreous chambers. The key finding was that the extent and consistency of these hyperopic ametropias varied with the eccentricity of the dual-focus zones. The results confirm that myopic defocus in the near periphery can slow axial growth, but that imposed defocus beyond about 20 degrees from the fovea does not consistently alter central refractive development.

J	Ayhan, Inci; Kurtcan, Melisa; Thorpe, Lucas								The effect of action on perceptual feature binding								VISION RESEARCH				177				97	108		10.1016/j.visres.2020.09.001			DEC 2020	2020	Color-motion asynchrony (CMA) refers to an apparent lag of direction of motion when a dynamic stimulus changes both color and direction at the same time. The subjective order of simultaneous events, however, is not only perceptual but also subject to illusions during voluntary actions. Self-initiated actions, for example, seem to precede their sensory outcomes following an adaptation to a delay between the action and the sensory feedback. Here, we demonstrate that the extent of the apparent asynchrony can be substantially reduced when direction change is induced by a voluntary key press following a delay adaptation regime. We also show that the reduced color-motion asynchrony effect size following a motor-sensory recalibration is not a result of a change in the onset of perceived direction change relative to that of the color. This is particularly important as it implies, for the first time in the literature, that voluntary action is not only important in forming action-sensory outcome associations but may also act as a binding factor between the two perceptual features of a sensory event.

J	Clayden, Adam C.; Fisher, Robert B.; Nuthmann, Antje								On the relative (un)importance of foveal vision during letter search in naturalistic scenes								VISION RESEARCH				177				41	55		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.005			DEC 2020	2020	The importance of high-acuity foveal vision to visual search can be assessed by denying foveal vision using the gaze-contingent Moving Mask technique. Foveal vision was necessary to attain normal performance when searching for a target letter in alphanumeric displays, Perception & Psychophysics, 62 (2000) 576-585. In contrast, foveal vision was not necessary to correctly locate and identify medium-sized target objects in natural scenes, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 40 (2014) 342-360. To explore these task differences, we used grayscale pictures of real-world scenes which included a target letter (Experiment 1: T, Experiment 2: T or L). To reduce between-scene variability with regard to target salience, we developed the Target Embedding Algorithm (T.E.A.) to place the letter in a location for which there was a median change in local contrast when inserting the letter into the scene. The presence or absence of foveal vision was crossed with four target sizes. In both experiments, search performance decreased for smaller targets, and was impaired when searching the scene without foveal vision. For correct trials, the process of target localization remained completely unimpaired by the foveal scotoma, but it took longer to accept the target. We reasoned that the size of the target may affect the importance of foveal vision to the task, but the present data remain ambiguous. In summary, the data highlight the importance of extrafoveal vision for target localization, and the importance of foveal vision for target verification during letter-in-scene search.

This estimation bias, as well as other context-dependent biases, is speculated to reflect statistical mechanisms of inference that optimize visual processing. Importantly, although measured biases are extremely robust in the population, the magnitude of individual bias can be extremely variable. For example, measuring different individuals may result in TAE magnitudes that differ by a factor of 5. Such findings appear to challenge the accounts of bias in terms of learned statistics: is inference so different across individuals? Here, we found that a strong correlation exists between reaction time and TAE, with slower individuals having much less TAE. In the tilt illusion, the spatial analogue of the TAE, we found a similar, though weaker, correlation. These findings can be explained by a theory predicting that bias, caused by a change in the initial conditions of evidence accumulation (e.g., priors), decreases with decision time (*Communications Biology 3 (2020) 1-12). We contend that the context-dependence of visual processing is more homogeneous in the population than was previously thought, with the measured variability of perceptual bias explained, at least in part, by the flexibility of decision-making. Homogeneity in processing might reflect the similarity of the learned statistics.

The response to symmetry in extrastriate areas and its time course are modulated by selective attention								VISION RESEARCH				177				68	75		10.1016/j.visres.2020.09.003			DEC 2020	2020	Neurophysiological studies have shown a strong activation in visual areas in response to symmetry. Electrophysiological (EEG) studies, in particular, have confirmed that amplitude at posterior electrodes is more negative for symmetrical compared to asymmetrical patterns. This response is present even when observers perform tasks that do not require processing of symmetry. In this sense the activation is automatic. In this study we test this automaticity more directly by presenting stimuli that contain both symmetry and asymmetry, as overlapping patterns of dots of different colour (black and white). Observers were asked to respond to symmetry in only one of the two colours. If feature-based attention has no role the response should depend on properties of the image. If attention fully filters only the relevant colour the response should depend on properties of the relevant colour only. Neither of these models fully explained the data. We conclude that selective attention does modulate the neural response to symmetry, however we also found a significant contribution from the irrelevant pattern.

In this model, morphological and electrophysiological changes have been observed in the retina, superior colliculus and primary visual cortex (V1). However, no study so far has examined rhodopsin S334ter-3 rats with regards to their contrast response in V1 - a fundamental property of visual information processing. In this study, experimental rats (S334ter-3) carried one copy of the mutant transgene. We compared responses to spatio-temporal variations in luminance contrast in the primary visual cortex of these rats with those in Long-Evans (LE) rats to elucidate the degeneration-specific activity changes in this part of the visual pathway. We measured extracellular responses to different stimulus contrasts at the preferred parameters of each recorded cell under classical receptive field (CRF) stimulation. Our results show that V1 cells in the S334ter-3 group exhibit stronger spontaneous activity but weaker stimulus-evoked responses at medium and high contrasts. By fitting responses to a sigmoid function, we found that the S334ter-3 group had a lower R-max but a larger exponent N than the LE group. However, we did not find a significant difference in C-50 value. These results indicate the decrease in discriminating the stimuli contrast and loss in responses and lower signal to noise ratio after retinal degeneration. Our study supports the notion that a considerable degree of plasticity is found in cortex after retinal degeneration, indicating that visual restoration therapies would succeed if the retina could send useful signals to the brain.

In the four experiments we report here, we explored the spatial properties of the eggs illusion by manipulating retinal eccentricity and the location of the stimulus in the visual field. In Experiment 1, we examined whether central and peripheral configurations affected the illusory magnitude. In Experiment 2, we varied the spatial location of grid patterns and found that the eggs illusion was intensified when the pattern was presented in the horizontal, not vertical or diagonal position, relative to the fixation. In Experiment 3, we varied the retinal eccentricity of the pattern along the horizontal meridian and found that the illusion was enhanced in the retinal periphery. In Experiment 4, we manipulated the size of the stimulus and found that peripheral enhancement of the eggs illusion was more apparent for a larger pattern. The visual field anisotropy and the peripheral enhancement of the eggs illusion are discussed in relation to mechanisms underlying grid-induced illusions.

Young, Western adults implicitly assume the light source is placed not only above, but also to the left of, the observer. Previous evidence reached conflicting conclusions regarding the development of the assumed light source direction. In the present study, we measured the light source prior cross-sectionally in children aged 5-11 years, using an explicit shape judgement task. The light-from-above prior, and the left bias, were present as soon as children became sensitive to shading information, regardless of their age. Global processing preference was not related to the ability to perform the task. Similarly, scanning habits, as measured by reading proficiency and starting position in a cancellation task, were not related to the magnitude of the left bias. Children's ability to report shape-from-shading judgements increased with age, but age did not affect the direction of light priors. Thus, we concluded that the development of the light-from-above prior and leftward bias do not require an extended maturation period, but rather the direction of the light-source priors may be developmentally stable once measurable.

For the visual alley, 24 observers set rods that extended in depth so that they appeared 1) to neither diverge nor converge, 2) to be separated by the same lateral distance, or 3) to be perpendicular to the frontal plane. The separation of rods and the height of the observer's eyes were varied. Under each instruction, another group of 20 observers set the rods visually at eye level or kinesthetically without seeing the rods. We obtained these findings. First, the rods seen obliquely from above were set more accurately than the rods seen at eye level. Second, the visual settings were parallel to one another for small separation and were convergent to the observer for large separation, whereas the kinesthetic settings were divergent to the observer for the small separation and were convergent to the observer for the large separation. These differences between sense modalities were explained by the location of the egocenter(s) and the sensitivity to direction. Third, the visual or kinesthetic settings did not differ with instructions, suggesting that visual and kinesthetic spaces were Euclidean. Fourth, the visual angle of the near ends of the rods, plotted against that of the far ends, was described by Euclidean geometry, provided that the visual angle is exaggerated. Last, the kinesthetic angle of the near ends of the rods, plotted against that of the far ends, was not described by any simple geometry even when we assumed that the kinesthetic angle is exaggerated.

An independent contribution of colour to the aesthetic preference for paintings								VISION RESEARCH				177				109	117		10.1016/j.visres.2020.08.005			DEC 2020	2020	Walking around an art museum we can see how colours influence our aesthetic preferences: many great works of art would not be as impressive in grey scales. Is the beauty of colours in abstract paintings anchored to the spatial composition of the paintings, or can it be preserved even with random spatial arrangements? To test whether colour can have an independent contribution to aesthetic appreciation, we asked participants to select the preferred image among pairs of colour-manipulated versions of the same painting. We changed hue, but preserved lightness and saturation, by rotating the colour volume around the L* axis in CIELAB space. To test the influence of the spatial structure, the images of the paintings were presented: (1) in their original format, (2) spatially scrambled but preserving the colour composition, and (3) in a control condition with both colour and spatial scrambling. Relative preference as a function of hue angle was obtained for the four paintings in their original and modified forms. For the original paintings, we found that participants generally preferred the colour angles that matched the original version of the paintings. Crucially, participants preferred the same colour distributions for spatially scrambled paintings as for the original paintings. For the control condition, there were no preferred colour configurations. This suggests that the aesthetic preference of colours in our abstract paintings is not anchored to particular spatial compositions, but is at least partly preserved even when the spatial composition is destroyed. Paintings thus can contain an aesthetic component that is exclusively related to colour.		[Albers, Anke Marit; Gegenfurtner, Karl R.; Nascimento, Sergio M.

Some universities have instituted medical amnesty policies (MAPs) to encourage calling first responders to the scene of an alcohol-related emergency. This study describes perceptions of a university MAP and the perceived risks of calling first responders among a sample of undergraduate students at a mid-sized, private, residential university. Methods: This is an exploratory, peer-led study, in which student-researchers worked under faculty supervision to devise the aims of the study, recruit and conduct qualitative interviews with participants, analyze data, and organize major findings. Results: Participants in this convenience sample (N = 42) were majority female (n = 33, 78.67%) and white (n = 35, 83.3%). White students often reported risking disciplinary consequences (i.e. suspension) if found in violation of university alcohol policy. White students who were familiar with the MAP praised it as beneficial in improving student safety. Students of color (especially Black students) reported concerns for their safety in the presence of first responders (especially police officers). Awareness of the MAP among students of color was very low, and many reported low levels of institutional trust, suggesting the protections conferred by the MAP should be taken "with a grain of salt." Conclusions: MAPs may alleviate concern about some perceived risks of calling first responders, but that benefit may not be experienced equitably among students of color. More research is needed to understand the complex relationship between alcohol policies, alcohol-related injuries, policing, and race on college and university campuses.

Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 18-25 year olds receiving care in our ambulatory medical practice. Population differences were evaluated with the chi square test reporting unadjusted odds ratios (ORs). Results: Response rate was 16.6% (n = 1,017/6,119). The prevalence of ever EVP use was 46.0% of whom 13.9% used every day. Each additional day of alcohol use (past 30 days) was associated with increased odds of being an EVP user (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09), and cannabis use (past 30 days) was associated with a higher odds of being an EVP user compared to non-cannabis users (OR = 40.0, 95% CI 17.4 - 111.8). Observing a biological parent (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.98-4.24), step parent (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.02-4.19) and full sibling (OR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.78-3.00) using inhaled substances (past 30 days) was associated with increased odds of being an ever EVP user. Ever EVP users had lower odds than never users to report that EVPs with nicotine are "a little" or "a lot" more harmful than smoking "regular" tobacco cigarettes (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 - 0.76). Conclusion: Our survey is limited by a low response rate but confirms observed associations between EVP use and substance use and social influences. Our data also suggest that professionals should regularly screen for EVP use among young people, especially those with exposure to family members who used inhaled substances.

On this basis, a theory of phylogenetic continuity has been proposed according to which episodic and semantic memories have evolved from egocentric (e.g., path integration) and allocentric (e.g., map-based) navigation in the physical world, respectively. Here, we explored the behavioral significance of this neurophysiological model by investigating the relationship between the performance of healthy individuals on a path integration and an episodic memory task. We investigated the path integration performance through a proprioceptive Triangle Completion Task and assessed episodic memory through a picture recognition task. We evaluated the specificity of the association between performance in these two tasks by including in the study design a verbal semantic memory task. We also controlled for the effect of attention and working memory and tested the robustness of the results by including alternative versions of the path integration and semantic memory tasks. We found a significant positive correlation between the performance on the path integration the episodic, but not semantic, memory tasks. This pattern of correlation was not explained by general cognitive abilities and persisted also when considering a visual path integration task and a non-verbal semantic memory task. Importantly, a cross-validation analysis showed that participants' egocentric navigation abilities reliably predicted episodic memory performance. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis of a phylogenetic continuity between egocentric navigation and episodic memory and pave the way for future research on the potential causal role of egocentric navigation on multiple forms of episodic memory.

In a prospective controlled clinical trial in humans, invasive vagus nerve stimulation shifted food choice toward lower fat content. Here we explored whether hedonic aspects of an orally sampled food stimulus can be modulated by non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) in humans. In healthy participants (n = 10, five women, 20-32 years old, no obesity) we tested liking and wanting ratings of food samples with varying fat or sugar content with or without tVNS in a sham-controlled within-participants design. To determine effects of tVNS on food intake, we also measured voluntary consumption of milkshake. Spontaneous eye blink rate was measured as a proxy for dopamine tone. Liking of low-fat, but not high-fat puddings, was higher for tVNS relative to sham stimulation. Other outcomes showed no differences. These findings support a role for the vagus nerve promoting post-ingestive reward signals. Our results suggest that tVNS may be used to increase liking of low-calorie foods, which may support healthier food choices.

Since a body of literature implies that olfactory perception and function is hampered in obesity, we here investigate neuroanatomical correlates of this phenomenon. We assessed olfactory bulb (OB) volume with magnetic resonance imaging in 67 healthy participants with a body mass index (BMI) from 18.9 to 45.4 kg/m(2) (mean = 28.58 +/- 6.64). Moreover, we obtained psychophysiological data on olfactory ability (Sniffin' Sticks, Food associated odor test) and self-report measurements on eating behavior. Additionally, we collected parameters associated with metabolic health in obesity (waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio, leptin levels, body fat percentage, fat mass index, insulin resistance) to investigate recently proposed mechanistic explanatory models of why olfaction may be altered in obesity. We showed that OB volume was significantly lower in participants with obesity when compared to those of normal weight. Moreover, we found weak to moderate negative correlations between OB volume and BMI and related measures of metabolic health, especially leptin, body fat percentage, waist-height ratio and insulin resistance. However, neither OB volume nor BMI were related to olfactory function in our young and healthy sample. Nevertheless, our results provide first indications that obesity is associated with brain anatomical changes in the OBs.

Typically, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcutaneous peripheral nerve electrical stimulation (PNS) are often used in spinal PAS. PNS targets superficial nerve branches, by which the number of applicable muscles is limited. Alternatively, a muscle can be activated by positioning the stimulation electrode on the "motor point" (MPS), which is the most sensitive location of a muscle to electrical stimulation. Although this can increase the number of applicable muscles for spinal PAS, nobody has tested whether MPS can be used for the spinal PAS to date. Here we investigated the feasibility of using MPS instead of PNS for spinal PAS. Ten healthy male individuals (26.0 +/- 3.5 yrs) received spinal PAS on two separate days with different stimulation timings expected to induce (1) facilitation of corticospinal excitability (REAL) or (2) no effect (CONTROL) on the soleus. The motor evoked potentials (MEP) response curve in the soleus was measured prior to the spinal PAS, immediately after (0 min) and at 10, 20, 30 min post-intervention as a measure of corticospinal excitability. The post-intervention MEP response curve areas were larger in the REAL condition than the CONTROL conditions. Further, the post-intervention MEP response curve areas were significantly larger than pre-intervention in the REAL condition but not in the CONTROL condition. We conclude that MPS can facilitate corticospinal excitability through spinal PAS.

To better define it, we evaluated their performance on a targeted psychological profile assessment. We designed a case-control study comparing MOH patients and matched healthy controls (HC). Headache frequency, drug consumption, HIT-6, and MIDAS scores were recorded. All participants filled in the following questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory-II Edition (BDI-2), trait subtest of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The primary endpoint was to establish if MOH patients have an altered psychopathological profile. The secondary endpoint was to establish whether the worst profile correlates with the worsening of headache and disability measures. We enrolled 48 consecutive MOH patients and 48 HC. MOH patients showed greater difficulty in recognition/regulation of emotions (DERS, TAS-20), depression (BDI-2), anxiety (STAI-Y), and impulsiveness (BIS-11). We found a positive correlation among DERS, BDI-2, STAI-Y, and BIS scores and MIDAS and HIT-6 scores and among DERS and headache frequency and drug consumption. MOH patients showed a high rate of emotion regulation difficulties, depression, and anxiety, which may negatively affect their headaches. The ability to regulate/recognize emotions may play a central role in sustaining medication overuse.

Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder Show Altered Visuomotor Control During Stair Negotiation Associated With Heightened State Anxiety								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						589502	10.3389/fnhum.2020.589502			NOV 27 2020	2020	Safe stair negotiation is an everyday task that children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are commonly thought to struggle with. Yet, there is currently a paucity of research supporting these claims. We investigated the visuomotor control strategies underpinning stair negotiation in children with (N = 18, age = 10.50 +/- 2.04 years) and without (N = 16, age = 10.94 +/- 2.08 years) DCD by measuring kinematics, gaze behavior and state anxiety as they ascended and descended a staircase. A questionnaire was administered to determine parents' confidence in their child's ability to safely navigate stairs and their child's fall history (within the last year). Kinematics were measured using three-dimensional motion capture (Vicon), whilst gaze was measured using mobile eye-tracking equipment (Pupil labs). The parents of DCD children reported significantly lower confidence in their child's ability to maintain balance on the stairs and significantly more stair-related falls in the previous year compared to the parents of typically developing (TD) children. During both stair ascent and stair descent, the children with DCD took longer to ascend/descend the staircase and displayed greater handrail use, reflecting a more cautious stair negotiation strategy. No differences were observed between groups in their margin of stability, but the DCD children exhibited significantly greater variability in their foot-clearances over the step edge, which may increase the risk of a fall. For stair descent only, the DCD children reported significantly higher levels of state anxiety than the TD children and looked significantly further along the staircase during the initial entry phase, suggesting an anxiety-related response that may bias gaze toward the planning of future stepping actions over the accurate execution of an ongoing step. Taken together, our findings provide the first quantifiable evidence that (a) safe stair negotiation is a significant challenge for children with DCD, and that (b) this challenge is reflected by marked differences in their visuomotor control strategies and state anxiety levels. Whilst it is currently unclear whether these differences are contributing to the frequency of stair-related falls in children with DCD, our findings pave the way for future research to answer these important questions.

Integration of Convergent Sensorimotor Inputs Within Spinal Reflex Circuits in Healthy Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						592013	10.3389/fnhum.2020.592013			NOV 26 2020	2020	The output from motor neuron pools is influenced by the integration of synaptic inputs originating from descending corticomotor and spinal reflex pathways. In this study, using paired non-invasive brain and peripheral nerve stimulation, we investigated how descending corticomotor pathways influence the physiologic recruitment order of the soleus Hoffmann (H-) reflex. Eleven neurologically unimpaired adults (9 females; mean age 25 +/- 3 years) completed an assessment of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-conditioning of the soleus H-reflex over a range of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) intensities. Unconditioned H-reflex recruitment curves were obtained by delivering PNS pulses to the posterior tibial nerve. Subsequently, TMS-conditioned H-reflex recruitment curves were obtained by pairing PNS with subthreshold TMS at short (-1.5 ms) and long (+10 ms) intervals. We evaluated unconditioned and TMS-conditioned H-reflex amplitudes along the ascending limb, peak, and descending limb of the H-reflex recruitment curve. Our results revealed that, for long-interval facilitation, TMS-conditioned H-reflex amplitudes were significantly larger than unconditioned H-reflex amplitudes along the ascending limb and peak of the H-reflex recruitment curve. Additionally, significantly lower PNS intensities were needed to elicit peak H-reflex amplitude (Hmax) for long-interval facilitation compared to unconditioned. These findings suggest that the influence of descending corticomotor pathways, particularly those mediating long-interval facilitation, contribute to changing the recruitment gain of the motor neuron pool, and can inform future methodological protocols for TMS-conditioning of H-reflexes. By characterizing and inducing short-term plasticity in circuitry mediating short- and long-interval TMS-conditioning of H-reflex amplitudes, future studies can investigate supraspinal and spinal circuit contributions to abnormal motor control, as well as develop novel therapeutic targets for neuromodulation.

The objective of this study was to determine whether contact play in sport could alter white matter metabolite levels in female varsity athletes independent of changes induced by long-term exercise. Metabolite levels were measured by single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the prefrontal white matter at the beginning (In-Season) and end (Off-Season) of season in contact (N = 54, rugby players) and non-contact (N = 23, swimmers and rowers) varsity athletes. Sedentary women (N = 23) were scanned once, at a time equivalent to the Off-Season time point. Metabolite levels in non-contact athletes did not change over a season of play, or differ from age matched sedentary women except that non-contact athletes had a slightly lower myo-inositol level. The contact athletes had lower levels of myo-inositol and glutamate, and higher levels of glutamine compared to both sedentary women and non-contact athletes. Lower levels of myo-inositol in non-contact athletes compared to sedentary women indicates long-term exercise may alter glial cell profiles in these athletes. The metabolite differences observed between contact and non-contact athletes suggest that non-contact athletes should not be used as controls in studies of concussion in high-impact sports because repetitive impacts from physical contact can alter white matter metabolite level profiles. It is imperative to use athletes engaged in the same contact sport as controls to ensure a matched metabolite profile at baseline.

J	Yamagishi, Shimpei; Furukawa, Shigeto								Factors Influencing Saccadic Reaction Time: Effect of Task Modality, Stimulus Saliency, Spatial Congruency of Stimuli, and Pupil Size								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						571893	10.3389/fnhum.2020.571893			NOV 26 2020	2020	It is often assumed that the reaction time of a saccade toward visual and/or auditory stimuli reflects the sensitivities of our oculomotor-orienting system to stimulus saliency. Endogenous factors, as well as stimulus-related factors, would also affect the saccadic reaction time (SRT). However, it was not clear how these factors interact and to what extent visual and auditory-targeting saccades are accounted for by common mechanisms. The present study examined the effect of, and the interaction between, stimulus saliency and audiovisual spatial congruency on the SRT for visual- and for auditory-target conditions. We also analyzed pre-target pupil size to examine the relationship between saccade preparation and pupil size. Pupil size is considered to reflect arousal states coupling with locus-coeruleus (LC) activity during a cognitive task. The main findings were that (1) the pattern of the examined effects on the SRT varied between visual- and auditory-auditory target conditions, (2) the effect of stimulus saliency was significant for the visual-target condition, but not significant for the auditory-target condition, (3) Pupil velocity, not absolute pupil size, was sensitive to task set (i.e., visual-targeting saccade vs. auditory-targeting saccade), and (4) there was a significant correlation between the pre-saccade absolute pupil size and the SRTs for the visual-target condition but not for the auditory-target condition. The discrepancy between target modalities for the effect of pupil velocity and between the absolute pupil size and pupil velocity for the correlation with SRT may imply that the pupil effect for the visual-target condition was caused by a modality-specific link between pupil size modulation and the SC rather than by the LC-NE (locus coeruleus-norepinephrine) system. These results support the idea that different threshold mechanisms in the SC may be involved in the initiation of saccades toward visual and auditory targets.

Despite the importance of rehabilitating cognitive difficulties, and the release of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for cognitive rehabilitation, little is known about current clinician practice. This study aimed to explore current international clinician practice of cognitive rehabilitation. One hundred and fifteen English-speaking allied health professionals, including neuropsychologists and occupational therapists, from 29 countries outside Australia, were surveyed online about their current practice and reflections on cognitive rehabilitation. Both cognitive retraining and functional compensation approaches to cognitive rehabilitation were commonly utilized. Clinicians mostly targeted deficits in attention and executive functioning with retraining interventions, whilst memory deficits were mostly targeted with compensatory interventions. Clinicians were aware of and utilized various resources for cognitive rehabilitation, including CPGs. Clinicians considered the client's social support network, client engagement and motivation in rehabilitation, multidisciplinary team collaboration, and goal setting and implementation as highly impactful factors on the success of cognitive rehabilitation interventions. Whilst practice is broadly consistent with current CPG recommendations, addressing facilitating factors can further optimize client outcomes and quality of life following TBI.

Research has focused primarily on the ER strategy of reappraisal for regulating negative emotions, without distinguishing between classes of emotion, and there has been no attempt at exploring these differences in patients with ABI. The present study explored components of reappraisal, across classes of emotion, and their associated neuropsychological mechanisms. Thirty-five patients with ABI and twenty-two matched healthy control participants (HCs) completed two questionnaires, a battery of cognitive tasks, and an emotion regulation task (the Affective Story Recall Reappraisal task). Results suggest that those with ABI take longer, and generate fewer reappraisals than HCs across several discrete emotions. Notably, their ability to decrease emotional intensity did not differ significantly to HCs for negative emotions, but findings suggest that their reappraisals are less effective when up-regulating neutral emotions to positive. Working memory was the only significant predictor of the total number of reappraisals generated, and the time taken to produce a first reappraisal. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of neuropsychological rehabilitation, including the role of the relatives in implementing and reinforcing micro-interventions.

Predictive and mediating relationships among resilience and related variables (personality, coping, self-efficacy, hope, social support) were then tested for their association with burden and psychological adjustment among family members caring for relatives with severe TBI. Family participants (n = 131) from six rehabilitation units from New South Wales and Queensland completed assessments which elicited explanatory (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Ways of Coping Questionnaire), mediating (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Herth Hope Scale, Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey), and caregiver outcome (Caregiver Burden Scale, Mental Health sub-Scale-SF36, General Health Questionnaire, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale) variables. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed that resilience had a direct effect on positive affect in caregivers. Resilience also played a protective role in relation to two variables associated with caregiver vulnerability: an indirect association with caregiver burden mediated through social support; a direct effect on hope, which, in turn, was associated with positive mental health. Positive mental health then played a buffering role in relation to psychological distress and negative affect. Resilience, in combination with other psychological attributes, was associated with reduced morbidity among family caregivers after severe TBI.

We sought to examine the relationship between the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway and depressive-like behavior. Methods: Using a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, a total of 36 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four matched groups: (1) control + vehicle, (2) CMS + vehicle, (3) control + paroxetine, and (4) CMS + paroxetine. We investigated the effects of CMS on depressive-like behavior by using the forced swimming test (FST). Subsequently, the mRNA levels of members of the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway were assessed by qRT-PCR. Results: We found that rats exposed to CMS displayed a significant increase in immobility time and a decrease in climbing time in the FST. Moreover, mRNA levels of IL-6, JAK2, and STAT3 in the hypothalamus were increased following CMS. We also found that mRNA levels of IL-6, JAK2, and STAT3 were normalized by paroxetine administration, which coincided with normalization of the depressive-like behavior. Conclusions: The IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway may be activated in depression, and targeting this pathway may provide a novel effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression.

J	Duffy, Hannah B. D.; Roth, Tania L.								Increases in Bdnf DNA Methylation in the Prefrontal Cortex Following Aversive Caregiving Are Reflected in Blood Tissue								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						594244	10.3389/fnhum.2020.594244			NOV 24 2020	2020	Child maltreatment not only leads to epigenetic changes, but also increases the risk of related behavioral deficits and mental disorders. These issues presumably are most closely associated with epigenetic changes in the brain, but epigenetic changes in peripheral tissues like blood are often examined instead, due to their accessibility. As such, the reliability of using the peripheral epigenome as a proxy for that of the brain is imperative. Previously, our lab has found aberrant methylation at the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene in the prefrontal cortex of rats following aversive caregiving. The current study examined whether aversive caregiving alters Bdnf DNA methylation in the blood compared to the prefrontal cortex. It was revealed that DNA methylation associated with adversity increased in both tissues, but this methylation was not correlated between tissues. These findings indicate that group trends in Bdnf methylation between blood and the brain are comparable, but variation exists among individual subjects.		[Duffy, Hannah B.

Lessons From an Acute Surgical Pain Model								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						558703	10.3389/fnhum.2020.558703			NOV 24 2020	2020	Background: Pain has been associated with structural changes of the brain. However, evidence regarding white matter changes in response to acute pain protocols is still scarce. In the present study, we assess the existence of differences in brain white matter related to pain intensity reported by patients undergoing surgical removal of a mandibular impacted third molar using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis. Methods: 30 participants reported their subjective pain using a visual analog scale at three postsurgical stages: under anesthesia, in pain, and after the administration of an analgesic. The diffusion data were acquired prior to surgery. Results: DTI analysis yielded significant positive associations of fractional anisotropy in white matter areas related to pain processing (corticospinal tract, corona radiata, corpus callosum) with the differences in pain between the three postsurgery stages. Extent and location of these associations depended on the magnitude of the subjective pain differences. Tractography analysis indicated that some pain-tract associations are significant only when pain stage is involved in the contrast (posterior corona radiata), while others (middle cerebellar peduncle, pontine crossing) are only when anesthesia is involved in the contrast. Conclusions: The association of white matter fractional anisotropy and connectivity, measured before the pain stages, with subjective pain depends on the magnitude of the differences in pain scores.

Sexual Orientation, Social Determinants of Health, and Unmet Substance Use Treatment Need: Findings from a National Survey								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	2			205	213		10.1080/10826084.2020.1853775			NOV 24 2020	2020	Background: In 2018, an estimated 89% of individuals who needed treatment for substance use did not have their need met. Compared to heterosexuals, the disparity between needing and receiving treatment is thought to be even higher for sexual minorities. Yet, few studies have investigated sexual orientation and its relationship to unmet treatment need or the association between sexual orientation and specific reasons for the inability to enter treatment. Understanding these reasons is critical to eradicating barriers to treatment for sexual minorities. Obejctives: Using pooled data from the 2015-2018 National Survey of Drug Use and Health and guided by Andersen's behavioral model of health services use, this study examined the relationship between respondents' sexual orientation and their perceptions of reasons for unmet substance use treatment need. Results: Findings indicated that sexual minorities had more than double the odds of having unmet need due to access and insurance barriers. Conclusions: While further research and larger samples are needed to understand the relationships revealed by this study more fully, it is clear is that sexual minorities do not have equitable access to substance use treatment services relative to heterosexuals. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Financial Capability in Addiction Research and Clinical Practice								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	2			214	223		10.1080/10826084.2020.1853776			NOV 24 2020	2020	Background:Substance use disorders (SUDs) impact everything about an individual's life-health, family, employment, education, housing, transportation, and finances. By the time individuals with SUDs begin treatment-especially in publicly funded programs-most have few financial resources. Many have resorted to property crimes, resulting in fines, fees, and restitution costs that compound their financial difficulties. Reestablishing financial functioning is key to recovering from the consequences of addiction. Yet access to cash may also trigger relapses-especially in early recovery. Objective: This paper reports initial results from studies exploring how clients in treatment for SUDs manage their financial responsibilities, assessing their financial capability both in terms of access to financial services and personal financial literacy. Method: Using data collected between June 2017 and October 2019 from almost 5,000 SUD clients as they entered treatment as well as a financial needs assessment study of 70 clients during treatment, we conducted Chi-square testing and logistic regressions to analyze the relationships between client characteristics and financial capability. Results: Our results indicated that over 50% of individuals in addiction treatment did not have access to accounts at insured financial institutions, and that clients' ages and education levels were significantly related to their financial capability. We also found that 78% of clients feel that money management skills are important to their recovery. Conclusions: Many SUD clients in recovery have limited financial capability, and they are interested in developing financial skills. Increasing client financial capability may be an underemphasized, yet important part of recovery capital.

Objective: To assess whether offering patients with panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (PD/A) a choice between 2 psychotherapies yields superior outcomes to random assignment. Methods: In a doubly randomised, controlled preference trial (DRCPT), 221 adults with PD/A were randomly assigned to: choosing panic-focused psychodynamic therapy (PFPP) or panic control treatment (PCT; a form of cognitive behavioural therapy); random assignment to PFPP or PCT; or waiting list control. Primary outcomes were PD/A severity, work status and work absences at post-treatment assessment. Outcomes at post-treatment assessment, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups were assessed using segmented multilevel linear growth models. Results: At post-treatment assessment, the choice and random conditions were superior to the control for panic severity but not work status/absences. The choice and random conditions did not differ during treatment or follow-up for the primary outcomes. For panic severity, PCT was superior to PFPP during treatment (standardised mean difference, SMD, -0.64; 95% confidence interval, CI, -1.02 to -0.25); PFPP was superior to PCT during follow-up (SMD 0.62; 95% CI 0.27-0.98). There was no allocation by treatment type interaction (SMD -0.57; 95% CI -1.31 to 0.17). Conclusions: Previous studies have found that offering patients their preferred treatment yields small to moderate effects but have not employed designs that could rigorously test preference effects. In this first DRCPT of 2 evidence-based psychotherapies, allowing patients with PD/A to choose their preferred treatment was not associated with improved outcomes. Further DRCPTs are needed.

Multidisciplinary experimental studies with international collaborators are hindered by the closing of the national borders, logistic issues due to lockdown, quarantine restrictions, and social distancing requirements. The full impact of this crisis on science is not clear yet, but the above-mentioned issues have most certainly restrained academic research activities. Sharing innovative solutions between researchers is in high demand in this situation. The aim of this paper is to share our successful practice of using web-based communication and remote control software for real-time long-distance control of brain stimulation. This solution may guide and encourage researchers to cope with restrictions and has the potential to help expanding international collaborations by lowering travel time and costs.

Mothers may be particularly focused on cue processing early postpartum, contributing to intense preoccupation with their infant's well-being. Prior reproductive experience, or parity, may also impact the intensity of infant-cue processing and has been found to influence P300 neural responses to infant faces during pregnancy and at 2 months postpartum. However, we do not know whether this parity effect persists. Thus, we examined the P300 to infant faces in 59 mothers at 2 and 7 months postpartum. Our main finding was that primiparous, as compared to multiparous, women showed a significantly higher P300 to infant faces across the postpartum period. Findings further emphasize the importance of studying parity and its impact on the neural processing of infant faces.

An Electrophysiological Study of Aging and Perceptual Letter-Matching								EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH				47	1			92	108		10.1080/0361073X.2020.1848329			JAN 1 2021	2021	Background: Previous studies on perceptual letter-matching have found that younger and older adults showed "fast-same" effects for response time and "false-different" effects for errors but the effects were more pronounced for older adults. According to the Noisy Operator Theory, internal noise in visual processing distorts "same" trials into appearing different whereas distortion for "different" trials does not affect performance. Older adults have a "noisier" representation of items within perceptual processing which can impact perceptual matching. However, EEG measures may provide a more direct measure of letter-matching decisions. Methods: We measured the P300 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude, an index of familiarity in stimulus categorization, and behavioral measures (response time and accuracy) to assess letter-matching performance. Results: Individuals responded faster to "same" trials than to "different" trials but were less accurate. Older adults showed similar P300 amplitudes across trial type whereas younger adults produced a larger amplitude for "same" than "different" trials, suggesting that older adults showed less familiarity for "same" trials than did younger adults - a prediction of the Noisy Operator Theory. Conclusions: These ERP results are consistent with the Noisy Operator Theory - suggesting that an age-related increase in internal noise affected letter-matching performance.

To date, few studies have used neurophysiological measures in combination to subjective measures to assess cognitive workload during a walking task. This combined approach can provide more insights into the amount of cognitive resources in relation with the perceived mental effort involving in a walking task. Research Question: The objective was to examine cognitive workload in young adults during walking conditions varying in complexity. Methods: Twenty-five young adults (mean = 24.4 +/- 5.4) performed four conditions: (1) usual walking, (2) simple DT walking, (3) complex DT walking and (4) standing while subtracting. During the walking task, mean speed, cadence, stride time, stride length, and their respective coefficient of variation (CV) were recorded. Cognitive workload will be measured through changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (Delta HbO(2) and Delta HbR) during walking in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and perceived mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire. Results: In young adults, Delta HbO(2) in the DLPFC increased from usual walking to both DT walking conditions and standing while subtracting condition. Delta HbO(2) did not differ between the simple and complex DT and between the complex DT and standing while subtracting condition. Perceived mental demand gradually increased with walking task complexity. As expected, all mean values of gait parameters were altered according to task complexity. CV of speed, cadence and stride time were significantly higher during DT walking conditions than during usual walking whereas CV of stride length was only higher during complex DT walking than during usual walking. Significance: Young adults had greater cognitive workload in the two DT walking conditions compared to usual walking. However, only the mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire discriminated simple from complex DT walking. Subjective measure provides complementary information to objective one on changes in cognitive workload during challenging walking tasks in young adults. These results may be useful to improve our understanding of cognitive workload during walking.

Although patients with vestibular hypofunction aim to improve their VOR function, some retain dysfunction for a long time. Previous studies have explored the effects of direct current stimulation on vestibular function; however, the effects of random noise stimulation on eye-head coordination have not previously been tested. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the effects of high frequency noisy vestibular stimulation (HF-nVS) on eye-head coordination related to VOR function. Thirteen healthy young adult participants with no serious disease took part in our study. The current amplitude and density used were 0.4 mA and 0.2 mA/cm(2), respectively, with a random noise frequency of 100-640 Hz. The electrodes were located on both mastoid processes. The stimulus duration and fade in/out duration were 600 and 10 s, respectively. Subjects oscillated their head horizontally, gazing at the fixation point, at 1 Hz (0.5 cycles/s) for 30 repetitions. The coordination of eye-head movements was measured by eye-tracking and a motion capture system. Peak-to-peak angles for eye and head movement and deviation of the visual line from the fixation target revealed no significant differences between HF-nVS and sham. The lag time between the eye and head movement with HF-nVS post-stimulation was significantly shorter than that of the sham. We found that HF-nVS can reduce the lag time between eye and head movement and improve coordination, contributing to a clear retinal image. This technique could be applied as a form of VOR training for patients with vestibular hypofunction.

We examined the efficacy and safety of amantadine for treatment of apathy in two individuals with brain injury. Two double-blind, randomized, single-case experimental (baseline-amantadine-placebo-withdrawal) design (SCED) studies. Apathy measures included a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) apathy subscale and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults "Initiate" subscale. Safety measures included a rating scale of possible side effects of amantadine and physical examinations. No difference in apathy symptoms (VAS) between baseline and amantadine phase was found in case 1 (NAP = 0.55). Surprisingly, in case 2, apathy symptoms deteriorated from baseline to amantadine phase (NAP = 0.28, 90% CI = -0.69 to -0.20) and improved from amantadine to placebo phase (NAP = 0.92, 90% CI = 0.60-1.00). This improvement was also found on the NPI apathy subscale. Side effects of amantadine were observed in case 2. In this SCED study, amantadine did not improve apathy symptoms in two individuals with brain injury. However, this study shows that side effects of amantadine can occur which lead to a significant decrease in well-being. More high quality studies are required.

Further, substance use often increases post-TBI and, thus, individuals who chronically use cannabis may unknowingly be exceeding safe or therapeutic doses. The current cross-sectional study explores the prevalence of cannabis use among university students with and without a history of concussion and examines the relationship between concussion and post-concussive symptoms as a function of cannabis use. Eighty-four undergraduates (n = 51 without a prior concussion; n = 33 with a prior concussion) completed a series of questionnaires, capturing their head injury history, current and past substance use, and post-concussive symptomatology. Results indicated that those with a history of concussion were more likely to use cannabis and had higher cannabis use severity scores compared to those without a previous concussion. Further, among cannabis users only, concussion severity demonstrated a significant positive association with post-concussive symptom (e.g., headaches, memory problems) severity (i.e., frequency, intensity, duration). Taken together, the long-term use of cannabis may be detrimental to individuals with a history of concussion, exacerbating, rather than mitigating, post-concussive symptoms.

Given the nature and extent of the damage, cognitive and functional deficits are typically chronic even after standard therapies. Here, we describe a novel treatment approach that used high definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with a 62-year-old male who was 5 years post-anoxic leukoencephalopathy secondary to an accidental drug overdose. HD-tDCS was administered over the left lateral prefrontal cortex across 29 daily sessions at 2 mA (20 min/session) in order to address dysexecutive behaviors. Results demonstrated improved delayed memory and trends for improved visuospatial and semantic fluency performance as well as improved insight and daily functioning, all of which returned to baseline by the end of a 10 week no-contact follow up period. Resting state fMRI connectivity results mirrored these changes by showing increased dorsal attention and cingulo-opercular but reduced ventral attention network connectivity after session 29, all of which returned to baseline at follow-up. These findings suggest HD-tDCS may benefit functioning even following serious and pervasive anoxic injury.

In this study, we explored the use of modified eye tracking and steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI, in combination with the Shuffle Speller typing interface, for this population. Two participants with late-stage ALS, visual impairments, and minimal volitional movement completed a single-case experimental research design comparing copy-spelling performance with three different typing systems: (1) commercially available eye tracking communication software, (2) Shuffle Speller with modified eye tracking, and (3) Shuffle Speller with SSVEP BCI. Participant 1 was unable to type any correct characters with the commercial system, but achieved accuracies of up to 50% with Shuffle Speller eye tracking and 89% with Shuffle Speller BCI. Participant 2 also had higher maximum accuracies with Shuffle Speller, typing with up to 63% accuracy with eye tracking and 100% accuracy with BCI. However, participants' typing accuracy for both Shuffle Speller conditions was highly variable, particularly in the BCI condition. Both the Shuffle Speller interface and SSVEP BCI input show promise for improving typing performance for people with late-stage ALS. Further development of innovative BCI systems for this population is needed.

Think Hard or Think Smart: Network Reconfigurations After Divergent Thinking Associate With Creativity Performance								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						571118	10.3389/fnhum.2020.571118			NOV 20 2020	2020	Evidence suggests divergent thinking is the cognitive basis of creative thoughts. Neuroimaging literature using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has revealed network reorganizations during divergent thinking. Recent studies have revealed the changes of network organizations when performing creativity tasks, but such brain reconfigurations may be prolonged after task and be modulated by the trait of creativity. To investigate the dynamic reconfiguration, 40 young participants were recruited to perform consecutive Alternative Uses Tasks (AUTs) for divergent thinking and two resting-state scans (before and after AUT) were used for mapping the brain reorganizations after AUT. We split participants into high- and low-creative groups based on creative achievement questionnaire (CAQ) and targeted on reconfigurations of the two brain networks: (1) default-mode network (DMN) and (2) the network seeded at the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) because the between-group difference of AUT-induced brain activation located at the left IFG. The changes of post-AUT RSFCs (DMN and IFGN) indicated the prolonged effect of divergent thinking. More specifically, the alterations of RSFCIFG-AG and RSFCIFG-IPL (AG: angular gyrus, IPG: inferior parietal lobule) in the high-creative group had positive relationship with their AUT performances (originality and fluency), but not found in the low-creative group. Furthermore, the RSFC changes of DMN did not present significant relationships with AUT performances. The findings not only confirmed the possibility of brain dynamic reconfiguration following divergent thinking, but also suggested the distinct IFGN reconfiguration between individuals with different creativity levels.

The minority stress model postulates that disparities in AUD stem, in part, from stress specific to sexual minorities (e.g. heterosexism). However, little research has examined psychophysiological markers of minority stress reactivity and how psychophysiological stress reactivity is associated with lifetime minority stress and alcohol use among sexual minorities. Emotion modulation of the startle response is a well-established paradigm for capturing psychophysiological stress reactivity under controlled laboratory conditions. Purpose: This preliminary study is the first to use the startle experimental paradigm to examine psychophysiological reactivity to stigma among sexual minorities. Procedures: Sexual minority participants (N = 20; 55% female), aged 18 to 27 years (M = 21.80, SD = 2.65), were recruited from the community. We compared startle reactivity in response to three types of stimuli (stigma, negative, and neutral) among heavy drinking sexual minority young adults. Although statistically underpowered, we also explored the associations between startle reactivity and self-reported drinking behaviors and lifetime minority stress. Results: Both stigma and general unpleasant stimuli produced more psychophysiological stress reactivity than neutral stimuli among sexual minorities. Psychophysiological stress reactivity was correlated with greater quantity of drinks reported on drinking days in the past month, but not greater frequency. Additionally, lifetime exposure to minority stress was associated with a blunted reactivity to stigma stimuli. Conclusions: These findings provide methodological advances and important implications for minority stress theory and alcohol use among sexual minorities.

Childhood Trauma and Prescription Drug Misuse in a College Population								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	1			140	144		10.1080/10826084.2020.1846056			JAN 2 2021	2021	Introduction Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) predict health-compromising behaviors such as substance use. However, few studies have examined the association between ACE and prescription drug misuse among young adults-a growing public health concern. College students are especially vulnerable to prescription drug misuse due to social and academic stressors. This study investigated associations between ACE and prescription drug misuse (e.g., antidepressants, opiates, sedatives and stimulants) among a diverse college population, as well as gender and racial/ethnic variations in these associations. Methods: Data are from the 2018 American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment II (N = 3899) at a large, diverse university in California. Logistic regression models assessed the association between ACE and prescription drug misuse adjusting for gender and race/ethnicity and explored gender and racial/ethnic differences in the ACE/prescription drug misuse association. Results: ACE was associated with misuse of all prescription drugs. Due to significant effect modification by ethnicity in the relationship between ACE and stimulant misuse (p < 0.05), models were stratified by race/ethnicity. Every additional ACE was associated with an increase in adjusted odds of stimulant use among students identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and Hispanic, but not Whites. Conclusions: This study contributes to the mounting evidence regarding the importance of ACE screening and the use of campus-based prevention programs. This study also suggests programs should be tailored to address cultural variation.

However, end-of-life discussions can alleviate distress and uncertainties in both old and young adults, but only a minority uses this option in palliative care. Even in healthy populations, talking about death is often seen as alleviative and worthwhile, but rarely initiated. Objective: To investigate different psychological interventions (a) encouraging the readiness for end-of-life discussions and (b) changing death attitudes in healthy adults of different ages. Methods: 168 participants were randomized to four different interventions (IG1: value-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG2: motivation-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG3: combination of IG1 and IG2, CG: control group). Primary outcome was the readiness to engage in end-of-life topics. Secondary outcomes were fear of death, fear of dying and death acceptance. Assessments took place before, directly after the intervention and at 2 weeks of follow up. Results: IG2 and IG3 reported significantly more changes in the readiness to engage in end-of-life discussions than the CG (F[5.61, 307] = 4.83, p < 0.001, eta p(2) = 0.081) directly after the intervention. The effect of IG3 remained stable at the follow-up. There were no significant effects of the interventions on end-of-life fears or death acceptance. Acceptability of the interventions was very high. Conclusions: Short interventions can be useful to encourage end-of-life discussions and could be integrated in health care programs. The efficacy and effectiveness of these short interventions in palliative patients are currently examined.

Individualized Responses to Ipsilesional High-Frequency and Contralesional Low-Frequency rTMS in Chronic Stroke: A Pilot Study to Support the Individualization of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						578127	10.3389/fnhum.2020.578127			NOV 19 2020	2020	Background: In this pilot study, we examined the effects of ipsilesional high-frequency rTMS (iHF-rTMS) and contralesional low-frequency rTMS (cLF-rTMS) applied via a double-cone coil on neurophysiological and gait variables in patients with chronic stroke. Objective/Hypothesis: To determine the group and individual level effects of two types of stimulation to better individualize neuromodulation for rehabilitation. Methods: Using a randomized, within-subject, double-blind, sham-controlled trial with 14 chronic stroke participants iHF-rTMS and cLF-rTMS were applied via a double-cone coil to the tibialis anterior cortical representation. Neurophysiological and gait variables were compared pre-post rTMS. Results: A small effect of cLF-rTMS indicated increased MEP amplitudes (Cohen's D; cLF-rTMS, d = -0.30). Group-level analysis via RMANOVA showed no significant group effects of stimulation (P > 0.099). However, secondary analyses of individual data showed a high degree of response variability to rTMS. Individual percent changes in resting motor threshold and normalized MEP latency correlated with changes in gait propulsive forces and walking speed (iHF-rTMS, nLAT:Pp, R = 0.632 P = 0.015; cLF-rTMS, rMT:SSWS, R = -0.557, P = 0.039; rMT:Pp, R = 0.718, P = 0.004). Conclusions: Changes in propulsive forces and walking speed were seen in some individuals that showed neurophysiological changes in response to rTMS. The neurological consequences of stroke are heterogeneous making a "one type fits all" approach to neuromodulation for rehabilitation unlikely. This pilot study suggests that an individual's unique response to rTMS should be considered before the application/selection of neuromodulatory therapies. Before neuromodulatory therapies can be incorporated into standard clinical practice, additional work is needed to identify biomarkers of response and how best to prescribe neuromodulation for rehabilitation for post-stroke gait.

VS patients show cerebral hypermetabolism within the visual cortex, resulting in altered neuronal excitability. We hypothesized to see disease-dependent alterations in functional connectivity and gray matter volume (GMV) in regions associated with visual perception. Methods Nineteen patients with VS and 16 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was applied to examine resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Volume changes were assessed by means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Finally, we assessed associations between MRI indices and clinical parameters. Results Patients with VS showed hyperconnectivity between extrastriate visual and inferior temporal brain regions and also between prefrontal and parietal (angular cortex) brain regions (p < 0.05, corrected for age and migraine occurrence). In addition, patients showed increased GMV in the right lingual gyrus (p < 0.05 corrected). Symptom duration positively correlated with GMV in both lingual gyri (p < 0.01 corrected). Conclusion This study found VS to be associated with both functional and structural changes in the early and higher visual cortex, as well as the temporal cortex. These brain regions are involved in visual processing, memory, spatial attention, and cognitive control. We conclude that VS is not just confined to the visual system and that both functional and structural changes arise in VS patients, be it as an epiphenomenon or a direct contributor to the pathomechanism of VS. These in vivo neuroimaging biomarkers may hold potential as objective outcome measures of this so far purely subjective condition.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if a brief self-guided, online psychological intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated symptoms. Methods: 670 adults from the Swedish general population reporting daily uncontrollable worry about CO-VID-19 and its possible consequences (e.g., illness, death, the economy, one's family) were randomised (1:1 ratio) to a 3-week self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry and associated symptoms, or a waiting list of equal duration. The primary outcome measure was a COVID-19 adapted version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale administered at baseline and weeks 1-3 (primary endpoint). Follow-up assessments were conducted 1 month after treatment completion. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04341922) before inclusion of the first participant. Results: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in COVID-19-related worry for the intervention group compared to the waiting list (beta = 1.14, Z = 9.27, p < 0.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58-0.90]). Improvements were also seen on all secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning, insomnia, and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high. No serious adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: A brief digital and easily scalable self-guided psychological intervention can significantly reduce dysfunctional worry and associated behavioural symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of this study was to examine whether a 10-hour multi-component memory intervention improves the initiation and maintenance of targeted, adaptive behaviour changes. Sixty-seven cognitively-normal, community-dwelling older adults, age 50-91 (72% female) participated in a randomized controlled trial with outcomes assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and six-week follow-up. Participants were allocated to a five-week, in-person, facilitator-led group intervention (n = 34) versus treatment as usual (n = 33). The intervention was associated with significant changes in participant-reported primary outcomes, including increased initiation and maintenance of health-promoting lifestyle behaviours (personal health responsibility, stress management, physical activity, and nutrition) and use of evidence-based behavioural memory strategies in everyday situations. Individualized goals were attained in both the intervention and control conditions. Secondary outcomes replicated prior findings (increased knowledge and improved memory-related confidence, affect, and self-rated ability), but were null with respect to benefits on general health and well-being. Group interventions that target positive adaptation to age-related cognitive decline via behaviour change are a promising avenue to enhance the health and wellness of our aging population.

In this study, we aimed to detect brain and spinal cord hydrogen sulfide levels during different phases of tolerance and dependence to morphine and to determine the effects of inhibition of endogenous hydrogen sulfide production on the development of tolerance and dependence. Methods: Morphine tolerance and dependence was developed by subcutaneous injection of morphine (10 mg/kg) twice daily for 12 days. Physical dependence was determined by counting the jumps for 20 min, which is a withdrawal symptom occurring after a single dose of naloxone (5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Propargylglycine (30 mg/kg, i.p.), a cystathionine-gamma-lyase inhibitor, and hydroxylamine (12.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a cystathionine-beta-synthase inhibitor, were used as hydrogen sulfide synthase inhibitors. The tail-flick and hot-plate tests were used to determine the loss of antinociceptive effects of morphine and development of tolerance. Results: It was found that chronic and acute uses of both propargylglycine and hydroxylamine prevented the development of tolerance to morphine, whereas they had no effect on morphine dependence. Chronic and acute administrations of hydrogen sulfide synthase inhibitors did not exert any difference in hydrogen sulfide levels in brain and spinal cords of both morphine-tolerant and -dependent animals. Conclusion: It has been concluded that hydrogen sulfide synthase inhibitors may have utility in preventing morphine tolerance.

Methods: PWID (n = 404) recruited through five needle and syringe programs in South East Queensland were interviewed about HCV testing, status and treatment, recent injecting drug use, mental health and reasons for not taking up treatment. Predictors of treatment uptake were examined using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses. Proportions were calculated for participants reporting each reason for not taking up treatment. Results: We recruited 404 PWID. Of those tested for HCV (94%), 55% were HCV antibody positive and 31% with active infection. Approximately 36% of eligible participants had begun or completed DAA treatment. In adjusted analyses, injecting drugs three or more times per day was associated with not taking up HCV treatment (p = 0.005). Common reasons for not seeking treatment ("applied a lot") included experiencing no HCV-related symptoms (25%), HCV treatment not being a priority (23%), fear of treatment side effects (18%), and no knowledge of DAA treatments (15%). Conclusions/Importance: HCV education efforts for PWID should target misperceptions and lack of awareness of DAA therapy, and highlight the likely benefits of treatment even when asymptomatic. The use of peer workers and increased investment in integrated treatment facilities will likely aid treatment uptake.

Our aim was to compare levels of cognition, psychosocial functioning, and health-related QoL of CC survivors to healthy controls and examine the associations between these three domains. Seventy-eight CC survivors (age range = 7-16 years, >= one year since cancer treatment) and 56 healthy controls were included. Cognition (i.e., fluid intelligence, executive functions, memory, processing speed, and selective attention), psychosocial functioning, and health-related QoL were assessed using standardized tests and questionnaires. The cognitive performance, parent-reported psychosocial behaviour, and health-related QoL of the CC survivors were within the normative range. However, working memory was significantly poorer in survivors than controls, and visuospatial working memory below the normative range was more commonly observed among survivors than among controls. Processing speed significantly predicted survivors' performance in executive functions. Among survivors, greater peer problems were significantly associated with poorer cognitive functions and health-related QoL. Despite the evidence for good intellectual functioning, which might point towards adequate reserves, in some survivors, domain-specific difficulties may emerge years after cancer relating to psychosocial development and QoL.

However, there is very limited knowledge about whether this depression-relevant negative bias exits during initial attentional allocation, as compared with the converging evidence for the negative bias during sustained attention engagement. This study used both behavioral and electrophysiological measures to examine the initial attention engagement in depressed patients influenced by mood-congruent and mood-incongruent emotions. The dot-probe task was performed with a 100-ms exposure time of the emotional cues (emotional and neutral face pairs). The behavioral results showed that the patients responded faster following valid compared with invalid sad facial cues. Electrophysiological indexes in the frame of the two-stage model of attentional modulation by emotions provided cognitive mechanisms in distinct attention engagement stages: (1) the patients exhibited reduced P1 amplitudes following validly than invalidly happy cues than did the healthy controls, indicating a positive attenuation at an early stage of automatic attention orientation; and (2) the patients exhibited enhanced whereas the controls showed reduced P3 amplitudes following validly than invalidly sad cues, suggesting a mood-congruent negative potentiation in depression at the later stage of top-down voluntary control of attention. Depressed patients show a negative bias in early attentional allocation, reflected by preferred engagement with mood-congruent and diminished engagement with positive emotional cues/stimuli.

Methods: ASL data from 21 RPT patients, 17 LPT patients and 21 HCs were reviewed. Voxel-wise analysis and region of interest analysis were performed to explore differences in CBF among the three groups. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and tinnitus duration were obtained from each patient. Results: Voxel-wise analysis showed that the CBF of the left inferior parietal gyrus was increased in both RPT and LPT patients compared with HCs (P < 0.001). Region of interest analysis revealed that the CBF of the left primary auditory cortex (PAC) was higher than that of the right, while the CBF of the right secondary auditory cortex (SAC) and auditory association cortex was higher than that of the left. These lateralization effects were present in all three groups. Compared with HCs, RPT patients showed increased CBF in the left PAC and SAC (PAC: P = 0.036; SAC: P = 0.012). No significant correlations were found between PT duration or THI score and altered CBF in above regions. Conclusion: Increased CBF in the left inferior parietal gyrus is a common feature in both RPT and LPT patients, regardless of the perceived side of PT. The lateralization effects of auditory cortices may be a physiological characteristic of the normal brain. These findings may provide a new perspective for understanding the neurological pathophysiology of PT.

Growing evidence from structural imaging studies has implicated that stress and trauma exposures have negative effects on brain structural alterations. However, whether stress-related emotional distress and somatic symptoms are related to the structure of brain systems remains unclear. Also, stress-related somatic symptoms have adverse effects on emotional distress. In turn, emotional distress may influence somatic symptom reports via negative cognitive bias. However, whether this relationship is mediated by specific brain morphology remains poorly understood. First, we used voxel-based morphometric approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical basis underlying somatic symptoms and emotional distress in a large sample of healthy subjects (ages 18-27 years). We found that relatively high stress-related somatic symptoms were associated with reduced gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior insula, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Furthermore, a moderator analysis was performed to investigate the impact of recent stressful life events (moderators) on the association between specific GMVs (independent variables) and emotional distress (dependent variables). Interestingly, high levels of emotional distress were associated with small volumes of the vmPFC, anterior insula, hippocampus, and amygdala in participants with experience with more recent stressful life events. Finally, we performed mediation analyses to investigate the specific brain areas that mediate the association between emotional distress and somatic symptoms. The results showed that the effect of emotional distress on somatic symptoms is mediated by reductions in the volume of the hippocampus, the impact of somatic symptoms on emotional distress is mediated by the volume of the vmPFC. These results provided evidence that higher stress-related somatic symptoms are associated with smaller volume in prefrontal, insula, and limbic regions involved in emotion, interoception, and memory processing. The vmPFC and hippocampus play different roles in the relationship between emotional distress and somatic symptoms.

However, cognitive training (CT) provides a promising method to counteract these deficits. In the present randomized controlled study, we examined to what extent CT regimes can improve attention, verbal skills, and inhibition capacities. Over a period of 16 weeks, healthy older adults (65 years and older, mean: 70 years) received a trainer-guided multidomain paper-and-pencil and computerized CT. Pre- and post-training, a battery of psychometric tests was applied that measured the critical functions. This study used two control groups: a passive control and an active control group performing a relaxation training. Compared to a passive control group, the CT led to enhanced performance in the attentional endurance test and the interference list of the Stroop test, whereas no benefits in verbal and crystalized tests were found. Similar effects were found on the attentional endurance compared to the active control group. Additionally, word fluency was enhanced after CT, but the improvement in the Stroop test did not reach significance compared to the active control. The contents of CT were dissimilar to the psychometric tests showing far transfer, whereas no transfer to attentional or memory functions in the daily life assessed by the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire was found. This demonstrates specific gains of multidomain CT on cognitive functions not explicitly trained and lack of transfer to daily activities.

Mounting evidence suggests that the caudate is associated with body weight gain and obesity in adults. In adolescents, however, how caudate-related neural networks are associated with body weight gain is unclear because their central nervous systems are still developing. Objectives The current longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that caudate-related neural networks have a role in weight gain in adolescents. Methods The study included 20 healthy adolescents with a mean age of 17.5 +/- 2.0 years and a mean body mass index of 20.6 +/- 2.1 who underwent baseline rs-fMRI then follow-up rs-fMRI approximately 1 year later. Body mass index (BMI) was measured at both timepoints. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was utilized to analyze caudate-related functional connectivity (FC) using the caudate as a seed. Associations between caudate-related FC and BMI at baseline were assessed, as were associations between change in BMI and caudate-related FC between baseline and follow-up. Results At baseline, greater caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex FC was correlated with lower BMI (family wise error-corrected p < 0.05). Compared to the baseline, increased FC in the caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex at follow up were negatively associated with increased BMI (p < 0.05). Conclusion Given that the lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate are associated with inhibitory control, the caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex FC may have a preventive effect on weight gain in adolescents. The results of the current study suggest that developing inhibitory control would lead to the prevention of childhood obesity.

However, large-scale neural pattern induced by learning has been rarely studied. Here, we investigated whether global connectivity patterns became more reliable as a result of motor learning using a novel analysis of the multivariate pattern of functional connectivity (MVPC). Human participants were trained with a finger-tapping motor task for five consecutive days and went through Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning before and after training. We found that motor learning increased the whole-brain MVPC stability of the primary motor cortex (M1) when participants performed the trained sequence, while no similar effects were observed for the untrained sequence. Moreover, the increase of MVPC stability correlated with participants' improvement in behavioral performance. These findings suggested that the acquisition of motor skills was supported by the increased connectivity pattern stability between the M1 and the rest of the brain. In summary, our study not only suggests global neural pattern stabilization as a neural signature for effective learning but also advocates applying the MVPC analysis to reveal mechanisms of distributed network reorganization supporting various types of learning.

Due to the rising popularity of vaping among adolescents, it is crucial to understand the relationships between vaping and illicit drug use. Objectives: This paper examined the prevalence and trends of using vaping devices, marijuana vaping, marijuana products, synthetic cannabinoids and mist contents among youth. Methods: The study utilized 5 sets of public cross-sectional national data from the "Monitoring the Future" surveys during 2014-2018. It employed logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: There was an increase from 10.5% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018 for the past 30-day use of vaping devices among 12(th) graders. Furthermore, there was an increase from 21.6% in 2017 to 34.5% in 2018 for the past 12-month use of marijuana via vaping device among 12(th)-grade marijuana users. Additionally, there were significant associations between vaping device use and marijuana vaping, between vaping device use and marijuana use, between vaping device use and synthetic cannabinoids use, and between marijuana use and synthetic cannabinoids use from 2016 to 2018. Conclusions: Vaping emerged as another major route of marijuana administration among youth. Adolescent marijuana users had higher odds of using synthetic cannabinoids. This finding highlighted the importance of understanding what adolescent substance consumption pattern would be where marijuana was legalized. It also supported the hypothesis that vaping devices use correlates with, or is associated with, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids use.

However, at a behavioral level, the ability to recognize the intended emotion in both types of nonverbal cues follows a divergent developmental trajectory throughout childhood and adolescence. The current study a) identified regions of common neural activation to facial and vocal stimuli in 8- to 19-year-old typically-developing adolescents, and b) examined age-related changes in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response within these areas. Both modalities elicited activation in an overlapping network of subcortical regions (insula, thalamus, dorsal striatum), visual-motor association areas, prefrontal regions (inferior frontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), and the right superior temporal gyrus. Within these regions, increased age was associated with greater frontal activation to voices, but not faces. Results suggest that processing facial and vocal stimuli elicits activation in common areas of the brain in adolescents, but that age-related changes in response within these regions may vary by modality.

Despite the fundamental role of touch in infancy, the existence of similar visuo-tactile mirroring processes, supporting both felt and seen touch, still needs an in-depth empirical investigation. To this aim, we explored 8-month-olds mu desynchronization over somatosensory sites in response to felt and observed touch in a live experimental setting. EEG desynchronization (6-8 Hz mu frequency range) was measured during three experimental conditions: i) infants were stroked on their right hand by a parent (Touch condition); ii) infants observed a right hand being stroked (Observation Touch condition); iii) infants observed a right hand moving over the left hand without making contact (Action Control condition). Mu desynchronization of somatosensory sites contralateral to the hand being stroked emerged in response to both Touch and Observation Touch conditions, but not in the Action control condition. Further, greater mu desynchronization was found in the Touch and Observation Touch conditions as compared to the Action control condition. Our results highlight the early involvement of a shared somatosensory system, likely supporting infants' understanding of others' tactile sensations.

Method: The study included 675 people aged over 65 years from 8 centers in various geographical regions. The polypharmacy status was categorized as non-polypharmacy (0-4 drugs), polypharmacy (>= 5 drugs). The subjects' physical function was assessed based on their "physical activity levels, Holden ambulation scores, gait speeds, and hand grip strengths"; their nutritional status based on the "Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA)"; and their psychological status based on the "Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale -CES-D". Results: The presence of polypharmacy in this population was found to be 30% (n = 203). A statistically significant difference was found between the groups on the level of physical activity, Holden ambulation score, and nutrition status (p < .05). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups also on hand grip strength, MNA score, Charlson score (p < .05). Conclusion: Polypharmacy was observed to have a significant association with physical function, nutrition, and depression in the elderly aged >= 65 years.

However, remarkable individual variability of cortical structure and function may have partially contributed to these discrepant findings. In this work, we applied the Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-Based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOL) method to identify fine-granularity corresponding functional cortical regions across different subjects based on the shape of a white matter fiber bundle and measured functional connectivities between these cortical regions. Fiber bundle pattern and functional connectivity were compared between ADHD patients and normal controls in two independent samples. Interestingly, four neighboring DICCCOLs located close to the left parietooccipital area consistently exhibited discrepant fiber bundles in both datasets. The left precentral gyrus (DICCCOL 175, BA 6) and the right anterior cingulate gyrus (DICCCOL 321, BA 32) had the highest connection number among 78 pairs of abnormal functional connectivities with good cross-sample consistency. Furthermore, abnormal functional connectivities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. Our studies revealed novel fine-granularity structural and functional alterations in ADHD.

Even during the state of euthymia patients are characterized by suicide risk. The aim of the study is to investigate the baseline brain activity in euthymic bipolar disorder patients in regard to suicide risk. We hypothesized that patients compared to healthy control group will demonstrate altered functional connectivity among resting state networks which will be directly related to current suicide risk. Method 41 subjects were enrolled in the study consisting control group (n = 21) and euthymic bipolar disorder patients group (n = 20). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate resting state brain activity and ROI-ROI functional connectivity analysis was performed. Suicidal risk was estimated using The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised. Results A two sample t-test revealed decreased functional connectivity between regions involved in the salience network in patients compared to the control group. This decrease was negatively correlated with current suicide risk. Conclusion Obtained results suggest the association between risk of suicide and activity of regions responsible for functions such as learning from mistakes, prospective thinking, and sensory integration.

J	Greber, Marielle; Jancke, Lutz								Suppression of Pitch Labeling: No Evidence for an Impact of Absolute Pitch on Behavioral and Neurophysiological Measures of Cognitive Inhibition in an Auditory Go/Nogo Task								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						585505	10.3389/fnhum.2020.585505			NOV 12 2020	2020	Pitch labeling in absolute pitch (AP), the ability to recognize the pitch class of a sound without an external reference, is effortless, fast, and presumably automatic. Previous studies have shown that pitch labeling in AP can interfere with task demands. In the current study, we used a cued auditory Go/Nogo task requiring same/different decisions to investigate both behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of increased inhibitory demands related to automatic pitch labeling. The task comprised two Nogo conditions: a Nogo condition with pitch differences larger than one semitone, and a second Nogo condition with pitch differences of only a quarter semitone. The first Nogo condition tested if auditory-related inhibition processes are generally altered in AP musicians. The second Nogo condition tested the suppressibility of the pitch labeling using a Stroop-like effect: the two tones belonged to the same pitch class but were not identical in terms of tone frequency. If pitch labeling cannot be suppressed, the conflicting information would be expected to increase the inhibitory load in AP musicians. Our data provided no evidence for an increased difficulty to inhibit a prepotent response or to suppress conflicting pitch-labeling information in AP: AP musicians showed similar commission error rates as non-AP musicians in both Nogo conditions. N2d and P3d amplitudes of AP musicians were also comparable to those of non-AP musicians. The event-related potentials (ERPs) were, however, modulated by the Nogo condition, probably indicating an effect of stimulus similarity. It is possible that, depending on the context, pitch labeling in AP musicians is not entirely automatic and can be suppressed.

These treatment decisions can be difficult when the neurological assessment of the patient is limited by unreliable behavioral responses. Reliable objective and quantifiable markers are lacking and there is both (1) a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the brain's ability to reconstitute consciousness and cognition after an injury and (2) the absence of a reliable and clinically feasible method of tracking cognitive recovery in ICU survivors. Our goal is to develop and validate a clinically relevant EEG paradigm that can inform the prognosis of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. This protocol describes a study to develop a point-of-care system intended to accurately predict outcomes of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. We will recruit 200 continuously-sedated brain-injured patients across five ICUs. Between 24 h and 7 days post-ICU admission, high-density EEG will be recorded from behaviorally unresponsive patients before, during and after a brief cessation of pharmacological sedation. Once patients have reached the waking stage, they will be asked to complete an abridged Cambridge Brain Sciences battery, a web-based series of neurocognitive tests. The test series will be repeated every day during acute admission (ICU, ward), or as often as possible given the constraints of ICU and ward care. Following discharge, patients will continue to complete the same test series on weekly, and then monthly basis, for up to 12 months following injury. Functional outcomes will also be assessed up to 12 months post-injury. We anticipate our findings will lead to an increased ability to identify patients, as soon as possible after their brain injury, who are most likely to survive, and to make accurate predictions about their long-term cognitive and functional outcome. In addition to providing critically needed support for clinical decision-making, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of key functional EEG networks associated with consciousness and cognition.

This notion appears to be commonly accepted for all children despite limited empirical evidence. In the present work, we examined whether working memory capacity would predict basic aspects of hearing, pure-tone frequency discrimination and temporal gap detection, in typically-developing, normal-hearing children (7-12 years). Contrary to our expectation, working memory capacity, as measured by digit spans, or intrinsic auditory attention (on- and off-task response variability) did not consistently predict the individual variability in auditory perception. Present results provide no evidence for a role of working memory capacity in basic measures of auditory perception in children. This lack of a relationship may partly explain why some children with perceptual deficits despite normal audiograms (commonly referred to as auditory processing disorders) may have typical cognitive abilities.

A positive influence was reported in elderly and injured individuals, whereas no beneficial effects were observed in young healthy active subjects, which is likely due to the large inter-individual differences in these subjects. Hence, this study investigated the acute effects of compression garments on balance control in young healthy active subjects by addressing the issue of heterogeneity of individuals' responses to the wearing of compression garments. Thirteen young, healthy, active subjects were recruited. They stood on a force plate which recorded the center of foot pressure displacements in a monopedal stance with the eyes closed and on a wobble board with the eyes open, while wearing compression garments or not. Statistics were first calculated with the data from the whole sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed in order to categorize the participants' behaviors into subgroups with similar characteristics. The whole group analysis showed that there were no significant effects attributed to compression garments. The clustering analysis identified distinct and homogeneous subgroups of participants. Only participants who swayed the more at baseline benefited from the wearing of compression garments to improve their balance control. These participants might have either a gravity-dependent preferred sensorimotor strategy with an exploratory postural behavior or poorer balance/proprioceptive abilities. Since poor balance control is a predictor of sports injury risk, wearing compression garments during sports practice could be viewed as a potential prevention strategy for individuals at risk.

Here, with the aim of examining the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control of impulsivity, we compared event-related monetary delay discounting task behavior and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed brain activity as well as resting state (rs)-fMRI activity, between women in the mid-luteal phase (LP) and women in the late follicular phase (FP). The behavioral data were analyzed and related to neural activation data. In the delay discounting task, women in the late FP were more responsive to short-term rewards (i.e., showed a greater discount rate) than women in the mid-LP, while also showing greater activity in the dorsal striatum (DS). Discount rate (transformed k) correlated with functional connectivity between the DS and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), consistent with previous findings indicating that DS-dlPFC circuitry may regulate impulsivity. Our rs-fMRI data further showed that the right dlPFC was significantly more active in the mid-LP than in late FP, and this effect was sensitive to absolute and relative estradiol levels during the mid-LP. DS-dlPFC functional connectivity magnitude correlated negatively with psychometric impulsivity scores during the late FP, consistent with our behavioral data and further indicating that relative estradiol levels may play an important role in augmenting cognitive control. These findings provide new insight into the treatment of conditions characterized by hyper-impulsivity, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In conclusion, our results suggest that cyclical gonadal hormones affect cognitive control of impulsive behavior in a periodic manner, possibility via DS-dlPFC circuitry.

We aimed to investigate the predictive accuracy of the TOPF and examine this word list at an item level against WASI-II scores, using Australian pronunciations. The sample of 219 healthy Australians were aged 18-82 years. Multiple regression analyses were used to replicate the TOPF and simple demographic models based on the US TOPF standardization. Rasch analyses provided a comparison of Australian, US and UK word order from the proportion of words pronounced correctly. The variance explained in WASI-II index scores ranged from R-2=.12 (PRI) to .33 (FSIQ-2), which was approximately half that reported in the US standardization study. The accuracy of predicted WASI-II scores was also slightly less in our sample. Thirty-two words were out of place by five places or more compared with the US word order and 30 compared with the UK. These results add to concerns about the application the TOPF with norms developed in the US and UK in the Australian context. Clinicians are advised not to apply the five error discontinue rule when using the TOPF in the local context. Development of a more accurate word reading task for use in Australia is warranted.

Brain Activity Associated With Regulating Food Cravings Predicts Changes in Self-Reported Food Craving and Consumption Over Time								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						577669	10.3389/fnhum.2020.577669			NOV 12 2020	2020	Neural patterns associated with viewing energy-dense foods can predict changes in eating-related outcomes. However, most research on this topic is limited to one follow-up time point, and single outcome measures. The present study seeks to add to that literature by employing a more refined assessment of food craving and consumption outcomes along with a more detailed neurobiological model of behavior change over several time points. Here, a community sample of 88 individuals (age: M = 39.17, SD = 3.47; baseline BMI: M = 31.5, SD = 3.9, range 24-42) with higher body mass index (BMI) performed a food craving reactivity and regulation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. At that time-and 1, 3, and 6 months later-participants reported craving for and consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods via the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) and ASA24 (N at 6 months = 52-55 depending on the measure). A priori hypotheses that brain activity associated with both viewing and regulating personally desired unhealthy, energy-dense foods would be associated with self-reported craving for and consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline were not supported by the data. Instead, regression models controlling for age, sex, and BMI demonstrated that brain activity across several regions measured while individuals were regulating their desires for unhealthy food was associated with the self-reported craving for and consumption of healthy food. The hypothesis that vmPFC activity would predict patterns of healthier eating was also not supported. Instead, linear mixed models controlling for baseline age and sex, as well as changes in BMI, revealed that more regulation-related activity in the dlPFC, dACC, IFG, and vmPFC at baseline predicted decreases in the craving for and consumption of healthy foods over the course of 6 months.

Previously, we have reported that decreased resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and decreased activations in dorsal attention network (DAN) such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were correlated with selective attention deficits during hyperthermia. However, whether the inherent functionally organized anti-correlation between the DMN and DAN would contribute to the behavioral deficits remains unclear. In this study, we collected the resting-state fMRI data of 25 participants during two simulated thermal conditions: normothermic condition (25 degrees C for 1 h) and hyperthermic condition (50 degrees C for 1 h). Using group independent component analysis (ICA), we investigated the functional connectivity within the DMN and DAN, as well as the anti-correlations between both networks. Paired comparisons revealed that decreased intranetwork functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the DMN contributed to executive control performance during hyperthermia using multivariate linear regression analysis. Paired comparison on the DAN showed that increased one in the posterior part of the middle and inferior temporal gyrus nearby the temporal-parietal junction area contributed to preserved alerting performance. Lastly but most importantly, we found that decreased correlation between mPFC in the DMN and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area in the DAN contributed to the executive control deficit, suggesting a weaker intrinsic anti-correlation between DMN and DAN during hyperthermia. These findings indicated that a functional reorganized architecture of DMN and DAN might provide a potential neural basis of the selective deficits for different cognitive-demand attention tasks in high-temperature environments.

A large neuroethics literature outlines potential ethical concerns about conventional DBS and aDBS systems. Few studies, however, have examined stakeholder perspectives about ethical issues in aDBS research and other next-generation DBS devices. To help fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers involved in aDBS trials (n = 23) to gain insight into the most pressing ethical questions in aDBS research and any concerns about specific features of aDBS devices, including devices' ability to measure brain activity, automatically adjust stimulation, and store neural data. Using thematic content analysis, we identified 8 central themes in researcher responses. The need to measure and store neural data for aDBS raised concerns among researchers about data privacy and security issues (noted by 91% of researchers), including the avoidance of unintended or unwanted third-party access to data. Researchers reflected on the risks and safety (83%) of aDBS due to the experimental nature of automatically modulating then observing stimulation effects outside a controlled clinical setting and in relation to need for surgical battery changes. Researchers also stressed the importance of ensuring informed consent and adequate patient understanding (74%). Concerns related to automaticity and device programming (65%) were discussed, including current uncertainties about biomarker validity. Additionally, researchers discussed the potential impacts of automatic stimulation on patients' autonomy and control over stimulation (57%). Lastly, researchers discussed concerns related to patient selection (defining criteria for candidacy) (39%), challenges of ensuring post-trial access to care and device maintenance (39%), and potential effects on personality and identity (30%). To help address researcher concerns, we discuss the need to minimize cybersecurity vulnerabilities, advance biomarker validity, promote the balance of device control between patients and clinicians, and enhance ongoing informed consent. The findings from this study will help inform policies that will maximize the benefits and minimize potential harms of aDBS and other next-generation DBS devices.

Use of Tobacco for Weight Control across Products among Young Adults in the US Military								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	1			153	161		10.1080/10826084.2020.1846196			JAN 2 2021	2021	Background Approximately 17% of young adults currently use tobacco, most commonly cigarettes and/or electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), followed by other products (i.e., cigarillos, pipe/hookah, smokeless tobacco). Cigarettes have been historically used to control weight. Little is known about use of non-cigarette products for weight control, particularly among non-college young adults. Tobacco use in the military is higher than civilians, and personnel have increased motivation for weight control due to military fitness standards. This population might be vulnerable to use tobacco for this purpose. Purpose: Exploring prevalence, as well as demographic and behavioral correlates, of using tobacco products for weight control, among a large, diverse sample of military young adults. Methods: U.S. Air Force recruits (N = 24,543) completed a questionnaire about tobacco use. Among users of tobacco products, recruits reported if they had ever used that product to maintain their weight. Results: Smokeless tobacco was most commonly used for weight control (12.2%), followed by cigarettes (7.3%), e-cigarettes (5.5%), cigarillos (3.3%), and hookah/pipe (3.2%). Using tobacco for weight control was associated with fewer harm beliefs and more regular use of that product. Among e-cigarette users, having a higher BMI and a lower educational background was associated with ever using this product for weight control. Conclusions: The belief that a tobacco product helps control one's weight might increase the prevalence, and frequency of use, of that product among military young adults. Tobacco cessation programs should assess for this motivation of use and provide education about tobacco harm and alternative strategies for weight maintenance.		[Fahey, M.

J	Wu, Xin; Guo, Jiajia; Wang, Yufeng; Zou, Feng; Guo, Peifang; Lv, Jieyu; Zhang, Meng								The Relationships Between Trait Creativity and Resting-State EEG Microstates Were Modulated by Self-Esteem								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						576114	10.3389/fnhum.2020.576114			NOV 11 2020	2020	Numerous studies find that creativity is not only associated with low effort and flexible processes but also associated with high effort and persistent processes especially when defensive behavior is induced by negative emotions. The important role of self-esteem is to buffer negative emotions, and individuals with low self-esteem are prone to instigating various forms of defensive behaviors. Thus, we thought that the relationships between trait creativity and executive control brain networks might be modulated by self-esteem. The resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates can be divided into four classical types (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), which can reflect the brain networks as well as their dynamic characteristic. Thus, the Williams Creative Tendency Scale (WCTS) and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) were used to investigate the modulating role of self-esteem on the relationships between trait creativity and the RS-EEG microstates. As our results showed, self-esteem consistently modulated the relationships between creativity and the duration and contribution of MS2 related to visual or imagery processing, the occurrence of MS3 related to cingulo-opercular networks, and transitions between MS2 and MS4, which were related to frontoparietal control networks. Based on these results, we thought that trait creativity was related to the executive control of bottom-up processing for individuals with low self-esteem, while the bottom-up information from vision or visual imagery might be related to trait creativity for individuals with high self-esteem.

This study investigated the temporal features of outcome evaluation (evaluation of feedback) and how they influence the processing of facial trustworthiness. A total of 25 college students participated in a decision-making task in which feedback was presented prior to a face stimulus. The decision of participants to continue investing was evaluated. We observed that trustors were more inclined to keep investing in trustworthy trustees or those appearing after positive feedback (gains). Event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that in the face presentation stage, trustworthy faces with losses induced more negative feedback-related negativity (FRN) than did trustworthy faces with gains and untrustworthy faces with losses. Further, faces that did not meet expectations induced more negative FRN. Trustworthy faces with gains induced more positive late positive component (LPC) than did trustworthy faces with losses and generated more motivated attention. Bottom-up and top-down processes were integrated for facial trustworthiness perception at different stages. In sum, top-down processing exerted a greater impact during the early stage of facial trustworthiness perception, both top-down and bottom-up processing were involved in the medium term, and bottom-up processing exerted a greater impact in the later stage.

Intervention programs involving antagonistic exercise tasks are being employed to help prevent falls and reduce the need for nursing care in older populations. Meanwhile, the effects of such tasks on blood flow in the brain remain obscure. This study aimed to clarify the effects of antagonistic tasks on prefrontal cortical cerebral hemodynamics. Materials and Methods: We assessed 13 healthy adults (two men, 11 women; mean age, 21.4 +/- 1.0 years). Participants imitated each of the antagonistic tasks presented on a PC monitor placed at a 120-mm viewing distance. All participants performed six tasks, consisting of upper-limb tasks (non-antagonism, simple antagonism, and complex antagonism) and upper- and lower-limb tasks (tasks combining lower-limb opening and closing movements with each upper-limb task). We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure cerebral blood flow dynamics, with oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration changes as the main outcome. A 10-channel probe was placed on the participants' forehead, focusing on the prefrontal cortex. We first obtained a baseline NIRS measurement for 10 s; the participants then imitated the task presented on the PC monitor for 90 s. We measured the number of errors and the subjective difficulty of each task. Results: The increase in prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb concentration was significantly higher in the complex antagonist conditions than in the non-antagonistic and simple antagonistic conditions. There were no significant prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb differences between the upper limb and upper- and lower-limb conditions (increasing number of motor limbs). Conclusions: The study findings support that an increase in finger-shaped complexity has a greater effect on cerebral blood flow dynamics in the prefrontal cortex than does an increase in the number of motor limbs involved in the task.

The Effect of Object Type on Building Scene Imagery-an MEG Study; The Effect of Object Type on Building Scene Imagery-an MEG Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE; FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						592175	10.3389/fnhum.2020.592175			NOV 10 2020	2020	Previous studies have reported that some objects evoke a sense of local three-dimensional space (space-defining; SD), while others do not (space-ambiguous; SA), despite being imagined or viewed in isolation devoid of a background context. Moreover, people show a strong preference for SD objects when given a choice of objects with which to mentally construct scene imagery. When deconstructing scenes, people retain significantly more SD objects than SA objects. It, therefore, seems that SD objects might enjoy a privileged role in scene construction. In the current study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to compare the neural responses to SD and SA objects while they were being used to build imagined scene representations, as this has not been examined before using neuroimaging. On each trial, participants gradually built a scene image from three successive auditorily-presented object descriptions and an imagined 3D space. We then examined the neural dynamics associated with the points during scene construction when either SD or SA objects were being imagined. We found that SD objects elicited theta changes relative to SA objects in two brain regions, the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we observed that the vmPFC drove STG activity. These findings may indicate that SD objects serve to activate schematic and conceptual knowledge in vmPFC and STG upon which scene representations are then built.

Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in the Self- and Other-Referential Processing								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						579703	10.3389/fnhum.2020.579703			NOV 10 2020	2020	Neuroimaging studies have revealed a multitude of brain regions associated with self- and other-referential processing, but the question how the distinction between self, close other, and distant other is processed in the brain still remains unanswered. The default mode network (DMN) is the primary network associated with the processing of self, whereas task-positive networks (TPN) are indispensable for the processing of external objects. We hypothesize that self- and close-other-processing would engage DMN more than TPN, whereas distant-other-processing would engage TPN to a greater extent. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data obtained in the course of a trait adjective judgment task while subjects evaluated themselves, the best friend, a neutral stranger, and an unpleasant person. A positive association between the degree of self-relatedness and the degree of DMN dominance was revealed in cortical midline structures (CMS) and the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Relative to TPN, DMN showed greater connectivity in me than in friend, in friend than in stranger, and in stranger than in unpleasant conditions. These results show that the less the evaluated person is perceived as self-related, the more the balance of activity in the brain shifts from the DMN to the TPN.

Twenty patients with DED and 23 healthy controls (HCs) were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to analyze the imaging data. Relative to the HCs, the patients with DED showed significantly increased ReHo values in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), left superior temporal gyrus, and right superior medial prefrontal cortex, and significantly decreased ReHo values in the right superior frontal gyrus/middle frontal gyrus and bilateral middle cingulum (MC). SVM results indicated that the combination of ReHo values in the left MC and the left IOG in distinguishing patients with DED from HCs had a sensitivity of 95.00%, a specificity of 91.30%, and an accuracy of 93.02%. The present study found that the patients with DED had abnormal ReHo values in the limbic-cortical circuits. A combination of ReHo values in the left MC and the left IOG could be applied as a potential imaging biomarker to distinguish patients with DED from HCs. The dysfunction of limbic-cortical circuits may play an important role in the pathophysiology of DED.

J	Huang, Jianjun; Xu, Jiahui; Kang, Li; Zhang, Tijiang								Identifying Epilepsy Based on Deep Learning Using DKI Images								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						590815	10.3389/fnhum.2020.590815			NOV 9 2020	2020	Epilepsy is a serious hazard to human health. Minimally invasive surgery is currently an extremely effective treatment to refractory epilepsy. However, it is challenging to localize the lesion for most patients because they are MRI negative. The identification of epileptic foci in local brain region will be helpful to the localization of epileptic foci because we can infer whether there is a lesion from the results of the classification. For the sake of simplicity and the data we collected, only the hippocampus was segmented as a local brain region and classified in this paper. We recruited 59 children with hippocampus epilepsy and 70 age- and sex-matched normal controls, and diffusion kurtosis images (DKI) for all subjects were collected because DKI can understand the pathological changes of local tissues and other regions of epileptic foci at the molecular level. Then, a mask of hippocampus was made to segment the hippocampus of FA, MD, and MK images for all subjects, which are the parameter images of DKI and were used to perform the independent-sample t-test and the classification task. At last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique was developed to extract features of FA, MD, MK, and the fusion of FA and MK, and support vector machine was employed to classify epilepsy and normal control. Finally, the classifier produced 90.8% accuracy for patient vs. normal controls. Experimental results showed that the features extraction based on CNN is very effective, and the high accuracy of classification means that FA and MK are two remarkable features to identify epilepsy, which indicates that DKI images can act as an important biomarker for epilepsy from the point of view of clinical diagnosis.

Case Report: Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) Deep Brain Stimulation Induced Keyboard Typing Dysfunction								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						583441	10.3389/fnhum.2020.583441			NOV 9 2020	2020	Introduction:Typing on a keyboard requires complex collaboration between visuospatial/procedural memory, language, and motor function. The impaired ability to type, independent of motor deficits, apraxia, or aphasia has been coined "dystypia." Case Presentation: A 68-year-old woman with a history of blepharospasm, oromandibular, and segmental dystonia underwent bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of a waning response to botulinum toxin therapy. Following DBS, she discovered she no longer "remembered" how to type fluidly and had to "hunt and peck" for letters on the keyboard. This issue persisted at a 2-year follow-up. The patient underwent serial typing tests with the DBS ON vs. OFF. Post-operative lead reconstruction was performed using Lead-DBS. The volume of tissue activation (VTA) modeling was combined with whole-brain tractography. Results: Typing improved when the device was switched to the DBS OFF state. Cortical mapping revealed strong modulation of the right angular gyrus, left calcarine fissure, and left cuneus. There was also activation of bilateral supplemental motor areas and superior parietal gyri. Discussion: Shared lesion topography analysis of dystypia cases in the literature has suggested the involvement of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The SLF involves the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and arcuate fasciculus. Our patient's connectivity pattern suggested SLF involvement. The improvement in OFF state typing and her imaging together suggested that the dystypia in her case was a stimulation-induced side effect. Conclusion: Dystypia is a rare side effect of Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) DBS therapy and may be associated with SLF involvement.

However, few studies have been designed to investigate the difference between responding to emotional female vs. male faces, nor gender differences in responses. The present experiment investigated startle EMG responses to a startle probe while viewing pictures of neutral, happy, angry, fearful, and sad facial expressions presented by female and male models. Participants were divided into female and male groups. Results showed that emotional facial expressions interact with model gender to produce startle potentiation to a probe: greater responses were found while viewing angry expressions by male models, and while viewing happy faces by female models. There were no differences in responses between male and female participants. We argue that these findings underline theimportance of controlling for model gender in research using facial expressions as stimuli.

J	Alm, Per A.								Streptococcal Infection as a Major Historical Cause of Stuttering: Data, Mechanisms, and Current Importance								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						569519	10.3389/fnhum.2020.569519			NOV 9 2020	2020	Stuttering is one of the most well-known speech disorders, but the underlying neurological mechanisms are debated. In addition to genetic factors, there are also major non-genetic contributions. It is here proposed that infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) was a major underlying cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s when penicillin was introduced in 1943. The main mechanism proposed is an autoimmune reaction from tonsillitis, targeting specific molecules, for example within the basal ganglia. It is here also proposed that GAS infections may have continued to cause stuttering to some extent, to the present date, though more rarely. If so, early diagnosis of such cases would be of importance. Childhood cases with sudden onset of stuttering after throat infection may be particularly important to assess for possible GAS infection. The support for this hypothesis primarily comes from three lines of argument. First, medical record data from the 1930s strongly indicates that there was one type of medical event in particular that preceded the onset of childhood stuttering with unexpected frequency: diseases related to GAS throat infections. In particular, this included tonsillitis and scarlet fever, but also rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a childhood autoimmune sequela of GAS infection, which was a relatively widespread medical problem until the early 1960s. Second, available reports of changes of the childhood prevalence of stuttering indicate striking parallels between stuttering and the incidence of rheumatic fever, with: (1) decline from the early 1900s; (2) marked decline from the introduction of penicillin in the mid 1940s; and (3) reaching a more stable level in the 1960s. The correlations between the data for stuttering and rheumatic fever after the introduction of penicillin are very high, at about 0.95. Third, there are established biological mechanisms linking GAS tonsillitis to immunological effects on the brain. Also, a small number of more recent case reports have provided further support for the hypothesis linking stuttering to GAS infection. Overall, it is proposed that the available data provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that GAS infection was a major cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s, interacting with genetic predisposition.

Methods: Therapy impedance and current measurements were retrospectively collected from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or essential tremor (ET) undergoing ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). Baseline and follow-up measurements were obtained for intervals of at least 6 months without changes in stimulation settings. The single longest interval of constant stimulation for each electrode was included. Temporal trends in impedance and current were analyzed as absolute and relative differences and as the rate of change. Results: Impedance and current data from 79 electrodes (60 in STN, 19 in VIM) in 44 patients (32 with PD, 12 with ET) met inclusion criteria. The duration between baseline and follow-up measurements with constant stimulation settings was 17 months (median, with an interquartile range of 12-26 months) in the mixed group. Therapy impedance decreased by 27 +/- 12 omega/year (mean +/- 2 standard errors; p < 0.0001), and therapy current increased at a rate of 0.142 +/- 0.063 mA/year (p < 0.0001). Similar results were observed in the STN and VIM subgroups. Conclusions: Impedance decreases gradually over time, even when stimulation settings are kept constant. The rate of decrease is smaller than previously reported, suggesting that changes in stimulation settings contribute to impedance drift. Stimulation-independent impedance drift is gradual but relevant to constant-current programming.

Along with changes in muscular mechanisms, T1D is also linked to structural changes in the brain. How the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying muscle fatigue is altered with T1D and sex related differences of these mechanisms are still not well investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of T1D on the neural correlates of handgrip fatigue and examine sex and T1D related differences in neuromuscular performance parameters, neural activation and functional connectivity patterns between the motor regions of the brain. Forty-two adults, balanced by condition (healthy vs T1D) and sex (male vs female), and performed submaximal isometric handgrip contractions until voluntary exhaustion. Initial strength, endurance time, strength loss, force variability, and complexity measures were collected. Additionally, hemodynamic responses from motor-function related cortical regions, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), were obtained. Overall, females exhibited lower initial strength (p < 0.0001), and greater strength loss (p = 0.023) than males. While initial strength was significantly lower in the T1D group (p = 0.012) compared to the healthy group, endurance times and strength loss were comparable between the two groups. Force complexity, measured as approximate entropy, was found to be lower throughout the experiment for the T1D group (p = 0.0378), indicating lower online motor adaptability. Although, T1D and healthy groups fatigued similarly, only the T1D group exhibited increased neural activation in the left (p = 0.095) and right (p = 0.072) supplementary motor areas (SMA) over time. A sex x condition x fatigue interaction effect (p = 0.044) showed that while increased activation was observed in both T1D females and healthy males from the Early to Middle phase, this was not observed in healthy females or T1D males. These findings demonstrate that T1D adults had lower adaptability to fatigue which they compensated for by increasing neural effort. This study highlights the importance of examining both neural and motor performance signatures when investigating the impact of chronic conditions on neuromuscular fatigue. Additionally, the findings have implications for developing intervention strategies for training, rehabilitation, and ergonomics considerations for individuals with chronic conditions.

This study identifies distinct patterns (classes) of substance use among 30- to 80-year olds, identifies demographic subgroups with the highest probability of class memberships, and compares classes on key indicators of functioning. Method: Participants (n = 1,877) were from the RAND American Life Panel. Online survey measures included current alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and nonmedical prescription drug use, as well as mental, physical, and social functioning. Results: Latent class analysis identified four classes: "Lighter Drinking" (46.6%), "Abstaining" (33.7%), "Heavy Drinking with Cigarette/Cannabis Use" (17.1%), and "Cigarette Smoking with Prescription Drug/Cannabis Use" (2.6%). Of these classes, "Cigarette Smoking with Prescription Drug/Cannabis Use" reported the worst mental and physical functioning, and greater loneliness than the "Lighter Drinking" class. "Heavy Drinking with Cigarette/Cannabis Use" reported worse mental and physical functioning than the "Lighter Drinking" class and less social support than the "Lighter Drinking" and "Abstaining" classes. The "Abstaining" class reported consistently worse functioning than the "Lighter Drinking" class. Both polysubstance use classes were associated with younger age, less education, and lower income, and heavy drinking polysubstance use was associated with being male and unmarried. Conclusions: Although lighter drinking was the most common pattern, 20% of adults were classified into two polysubstance use classes associated with poorer functioning.

Older adults usually remember positive stimuli better than negative stimuli. However, studies examining the effects of discrete emotions on the elderly are still limited. The present study examined the effects of negative and positive discrete emotions (fear, disgust, and happiness) on recognition memory of older and younger adults. Method: In the encoding phase, participants studied happiness-, disgust-, fear-, and neutral- related photos while doing a line discrimination task that assessed their attention. After 45 minutes, they completed an old/new recognition memory test on a confidence rating scale and also rated self-relevance of photos. Results: Younger participants showed a more liberal response bias for disgust- and fear-related stimuli, and were also more accurate in recognizing disgust-related photos compared to others. Older adults showed a more liberal bias only for disgust-related stimuli, however, their recognition accuracy did not differ across emotion categories. Conclusion: These results suggested that the effect of disgust-related stimuli on recognition memory may decrease with age and emotion effects cannot solely be accounted for by the valence/arousal dimensions.

SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	6			630	640		10.1080/17470919.2020.1834449			NOV 1 2020	2020	In multiple sclerosis, conflicting results have been reported between social impairment and relatively preserved moral judgments, mainly tested with moral dilemmas. Some results even yet suggest signs of "ultra-morality" in these patients. The objective of the present study was to test this hypothesis with the moral/conventional distinction task, investigating the knowledge of social norms and the judgment of moral versus conventional transgressions. In the first condition, the permissibility of social situations was estimated. If the participant judged the situation as wrong, he had to estimate the seriousness of the transgression, to give verbal justifications and to re-estimate the permissibility when the law authorizes the act (generalization condition) and when a social authority recommends the act (dependency condition). Forty-six multiple sclerosis patients matched to healthy controls completed this task. Contrary to our hypotheses, patients showed less permissibility for moral transgressions or a higher seriousness but, unexpectedly, for conventional transgressions. Most importantly, abnormal justifications were observed (strictly moral arguments for conventional transgressions and vice versa). This suggests a lack of distinction between conventional and moral judgment in multiple sclerosis. This confusion may explain the "ultra-morality" sometimes reported, if patients base their judgment mainly on social knowledge and not on emotional processing.

At the same time, a data conversion method of modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) with partial pathlength (PPL) is proposed. In the experiment, three kinds of tasks, grip of left hand, grip of right hand, and rest, are performed with eight healthy subjects. First, with a typical single-distance probe configuration (30 mm, 24 channels), the feasibility of the proposed MBLL with PPL is preliminarily validated. Further, the characteristic of the proposed method is evaluated with the multi-distance probe configuration. Compared with MBLL with differential pathlength factor (DPF), the proposed MBLL with PPL is able to acquire more obvious concentration change and can achieve higher classification accuracy of the three tasks. Then, with the proposed method, the performance of the multi-distance probe configuration is discussed. Results show that, compared with a single distance, the combination of the three distances has better spatial resolution and could explore more accurate brain activation information. Besides, the classification accuracy of the three tasks obtained with the combination of three distances is higher than that of any combination of two distances. Also, with the combination of the three distances, the two-class classification between different tasks is carried out. Both theory and experimental results demonstrate that, using multi-distance probe configuration and the MBLL with PPL method, the performance of brain function detected by NIRS can be improved.

In adaptive DBS (aDBS) systems, online tuning of stimulation parameters as a function of neural signals may improve treatment efficacy and reduce side-effects. State-of-the-art aDBS systems use symptom surrogates derived from neural signals-so-called neural markers (NMs)-defined on the patient-group level, and control strategies assuming stationarity of symptoms and NMs. We aim at improving these aDBS systems with (1) a data-driven approach for identifying patient- and session-specific NMs and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. The two building blocks are implemented as follows: (1) The data-driven NMs are based on a machine learning model estimating tremor intensity from electrocorticographic signals. (2) The control strategy accounts for local variability of tremor statistics. Our study with three chronically implanted ET patients amounted to five online sessions. Tremor quantified from accelerometer data shows that symptom suppression is at least equivalent to that of a continuous DBS strategy in 3 out-of 4 online tests, while considerably reducing net stimulation (at least 24%). In the remaining online test, symptom suppression was not significantly different from either the continuous strategy or the no treatment condition. We introduce a novel aDBS system for ET. It is the first aDBS system based on (1) a machine learning model to identify session-specific NMs, and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. We show the suitability of our aDBS approach for ET, which opens the door to its further study in a larger patient population.

Methods: A total of 22 young healthy male adults (mean age, 23.8 +/- 2.05 years; height, 1.75 +/- 0.06 m; weight, 71.4 +/- 8.80 kg) participated in a crossover design study that involved two experimental exercise conditions: momentum dumbbell and conventional dumbbell. Performance tasks included 10, 10-s sets of single-arm dumbbell exercise, with a rest interval of 60 s between sets and a 5-min washout period between conditions. The primary outcome was the cerebral concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)) in the frontal cortex and parietal lobe assessed during performance of both exercises using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The secondary outcome was upper-limb muscle activation measured using surface electromyography (sEMG). Outcome data were ascertained during exercise. Results: A significant between-condition difference in HbO(2) was observed in the frontal and parietal regions with an increase in HbO(2) during momentum, relative to conventional, dumbbell exercise (p < 0.05). Compared to conventional dumbbell exercise, performing a momentum dumbbell exercise led to a higher level of muscle activation in the anterior and posterior deltoids of the upper arm and in the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis longus of the forearm (p < 0.05). However, no between-condition differences were found in the biceps and triceps brachii (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Dynamic, compared with conventional, dumbbell exercise resulted in higher hemodynamic responses and greater upper-limb muscle activation in young healthy adults. The findings of this study showed differential cortical hemodynamic responses during performance of the two types of dumbbell exercise with a higher activation level produced during momentum-based dumbbell exercise.

J	Wobrock, Dennis; Finke, Andrea; Schack, Thomas; Ritter, Helge								Using Fixation-Related Potentials for Inspecting Natural Interactions								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						579505	10.3389/fnhum.2020.579505			NOV 5 2020	2020	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer unique windows into the cognitive processes underlying human-machine interaction. Identifying and analyzing the appropriate brain activity to have access to such windows is often difficult due to technical or psycho-physiological constraints. Indeed, studying interactions through this approach frequently requires adapting them to accommodate specific BCI-related paradigms which change the functioning of their interface on both the human-side and the machine-side. The combined examination of Electroencephalography and Eyetracking recordings, mainly by means of studying Fixation-Related Potentials, can help to circumvent the necessity for these adaptations by determining interaction-relevant moments during natural manipulation. In this contribution, we examine how properties contained within the bi-modal recordings can be used to assess valuable information about the interaction. Practically, three properties are studied which can be obtained solely through data obtained from analysis of the recorded biosignals. Namely, these properties consist of relative gaze metrics, being abstractions of the gaze patterns, the amplitude variations in the early brain activity potentials and the brain activity frequency band differences between fixations. Through their observation, information about three different aspects of the explored interface are obtained. Respectively, the properties provide insights about general perceived task difficulty, locate moments of higher attentional effort and discriminate between moments of exploration and moments of active interaction.

Although functional neuroimaging studies have investigated human brain responses to different types of tactile inputs, the neural mechanisms underlying high-frequency vibrotactile perception are still relatively unknown. Our aim was to investigate neuromagnetic brain responses to high-frequency vibrotactile stimulation, using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods: We measured 152-channel whole-head MEG in 30 healthy, right-handed volunteers (aged 20-28 years, 15 females). A total of 300 vibrotactile stimuli were presented at the tip of either the left index finger or the right index finger in two separate sessions. Sinusoidal vibrations at 150 Hz for 200 ms were generated with random inter-stimulus intervals between 1.6 and 2.4 s. Both time-locked analysis and time-frequency analysis were performed to identify peak responses and oscillatory modulations elicited by high-frequency vibrations. The significance of the evoked and induced responses for dominant and non-dominant hand stimulation conditions was statistically tested, respectively. The difference in responses between stimulation conditions was also statistically evaluated. Results: Prominent peak responses were observed at 56 ms (M50) and at 100 ms (M100) for both stimulation conditions. The M50 response revealed clear dipolar field patterns in the contralateral side with significant cortical activations in the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, whereas the M100 response was not as prominent as the M50. Vibrotactile stimulation induced significant suppression of both alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (20-30 Hz) band activity during the mid-latency period (0.2-0.4 s), primarily in sensorimotor areas contralateral to the stimulation side. In addition, a significant alpha enhancement effect in posterior regions was accompanied with alpha suppressions in sensorimotor regions. The alpha suppression was observed in a broader distribution of cortical areas for the non-dominant hand stimulation. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that high-frequency tactile vibrations, which is known to primarily activate Pacinian corpuscles, elicit somatosensory M50 and M100 responses in the evoked fields and induce modulations of alpha and beta band oscillations during mid-latency periods. Our study is also consistent with that the primary sensorimotor area is significantly involved in the processing of high-frequency vibrotactile information with contralateral dominance.

J	Young, David R.; Parikh, Pranav J.; Layne, Charles S.								The Posterior Parietal Cortex Is Involved in Gait Adaptation: A Bilateral Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						581026	10.3389/fnhum.2020.581026			NOV 5 2020	2020	Gait is one of the fundamental behaviors we use to interact with the world. The functionality of the locomotor system is thus related to enriching interactions with our environment. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been found to contribute to motor adaptation during both visuomotor and postural adaptation tasks. Additionally, structural or functional deficits of the PPC lead to impairments in gaits such as shortened steps and increased step width. Based on the aforementioned roles of the PPC, and the importance of gait adaptability, the current investigation sought to identify the role of the PPC in gait adaptation. To achieve this, we performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the bilateral PPC before performing a split-belt treadmill gait adaptation paradigm. We used three stimulation conditions in a within-subject design. tDCS was administered in a randomized and double-blinded order. Following each stimulation session, subjects first performed baseline walking with both belts running at the same speed. Then, subjects walked for 15 min on an uncoupled treadmill, with the belts being driven at a 3:1 speed ratio. Last, they returned to normal (i.e., tied-belt) walking for 5 min. Results from 15 young and healthy subjects identified that subjects required more steps to adapt to split-belt walking following the suppression of the left hemisphere PPC, contralateral to the fast belt. Furthermore, while suppression of the left hemisphere PPC did not increase the number of steps required to re-adapt to tied-belt walking, this condition did lead to increased magnitude of after-effects. Together, these findings indicate that the PPC is involved in locomotor adaptation. These results support previous literature regarding the upper body or postural adaptation and extend these findings to the realm of gait. Results highlight the PPC as a potential target for neurorehabilitation designed to improve gait adaptability.

Objective: During the reopening of society, medical and nonmedical workers were compared in terms of allostatic load. Methods: An online study was performed; 3,590 Chinese subjects were analyzed. Socio-demographic variables, allostatic load, stress, abnormal illness behavior, global well-being, mental status, and social support were assessed. Results: There was no difference in allostatic load in medical workers compared to nonmedical workers (15.8 vs. 17.8%; p = 0.22). Multivariate conditional logistic regression revealed that anxiety (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.31; p < 0.01), depression (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.17-1.29; p < 0.01), somatization (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.14-1.25; p < 0.01), hostility (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.30; p < 0.01), and abnormal illness behavior (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.66; p < 0.01) were positively associated with allostatic load, while objective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.89; p < 0.01), subjective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.80-0.88; p < 0.01), utilization of support (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.72-0.88; p < 0.01), social support (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.87-0.93; p < 0.01), and global well-being (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.41; p < 0.01) were negatively associated. Conclusions: In the post-COVID-19 epidemic time, medical and nonmedical workers had similar allostatic load.

The process was trained via the eGAS app, designed to facilitate motivational interviewing and goal attainment scaling. The study utilized a single-case, nonconcurrent, multiple-baseline design replicated across three clinicians and their 27 respective clients. We observed client-clinician dyads engaged in setting rehabilitation goals pre and post eGAS training. The clients had neurogenic conditions and were being treated for cognitive, communication and/or swallowing challenges in an outpatient setting. Two measures were used to collect data on the clinician's interviewing and goal-setting behaviors: (1) Assessment of Client-Centeredness when Interviewing and Goal Setting (ACIG) scale, and (2) a task analysis, i.e., the Clinician Interview Behavior scale (CIB). Training with eGAS had a strong effect on clinicians' collaborative interviewing behaviors, an inconsistent effect on their ability to adhere to a three-phase interview structure, and a strong effect on their ability to generate valid goal attainment scales. This study provides preliminary support that the eGAS process provides a feasible framework for training hospital-based SLPs engaged in neurorehabilitation to use collaborative interviewing behaviors and produce valid person-centered rehabilitation goals.

Therefore, this investigation examined sex and racial/ethnic differences in alcohol, cigarette, and cannabis co-use in a large and ethnically diverse. Methods: Participants were drawn from a large, multi-site study of adolescents from three regions in the United States (N = 4,129; M-age=16.10 years, SD = 0.59; 51% female, 49% male; 37% Black, 37% Hispanic, 25% White). Participants were categorized into eight mutually exclusive groups based on their self-reported use of alcohol, cannabis, and cigarettes in the last 30 days. Results: Unadjusted multinomial logistic regression revealed that males were more likely than females to use cannabis-only and to co-use all three substances. Additionally, Black and Hispanic adolescents were more likely to use cannabis-only, while White adolescents were more likely than Black and Hispanic adolescents to co-use alcohol and cigarettes. After adjusting for other sociodemographic variables (age, household income, parental education, and parent marital status), males were more likely to use cannabis-only than females; White youth were more likely than Hispanic youth to use cigarettes only and co-use cigarettes and alcohol. White youth were more likely than Black youth to co-use alcohol and cigarettes and co-use all three substances. Discussion: These results indicate sex and racial/ethnic differences in substance co-use that were not explained by socioeconomic factors. Results of this work suggest potential strategies for targeted prevention efforts and underscore the importance of continued efforts to better understand patterns of alcohol and substance co-use.

Drug and Alcohol Use and Misuse among HIV-Vulnerable Men, Trans Men, and Trans Women Who Have Sex with Men in the United States								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	1			111	122		10.1080/10826084.2020.1843057			JAN 2 2021	2021	Background Substance use (SU) and misuse are disproportionately more common among sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals compared to their heterosexual peers. Yet, little is known about regional and demographic differences in use and misuse among SGM. In this study, we investigated regional and demographic differences in SU and misuse in a U.S. national, internet-based cohort (n = 6,280) of men and trans persons who have sex with men. Methods: Data collected included the WHO ASSIST (substance) and AUDIT (alcohol) SU scales to estimate recent (<= 3 months) non-problematic use (<= 3 ASSIST, <= 10 AUDIT) and misuse (>= 4 ASSIST, >= 11 AUDIT). We used bivariate and multivariable logistic models to examine demographic and regional factors associated with SU and misuse. Results: Participants reported using alcohol (85.6%), cannabis (53.9%), and inhalants (39.1%) in the past three months. More than one-third self-reported misuse of cannabis, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), inhalants, methamphetamines, and prescription sedatives. We observed regional differences in substance use for cannabis (Southeast aOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.93; West aOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59, ref. Northeast) and prescription Stimulants (Midwest aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.00-1.93), as well as for cannabis misuse (Southeast aOR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69-0.99). We also observed significant associations between socioeconomic factors with use and misuse. Conclusions: Findings suggest geographic differences in misuse of certain substances among men and trans persons who have sex with men in the US, and that socio-economic factors, also play a key role in indicating risk.

Capturing Human Interaction in the Virtual Age: A Perspective on the Future of fNIRS Hyperscanning								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						588494	10.3389/fnhum.2020.588494			NOV 3 2020	2020	Advances in video conferencing capabilities combined with dramatic socio-dynamic shifts brought about by COVID-19, have redefined the ways in which humans interact in modern society. From business meetings to medical exams, or from classroom instruction to yoga class, virtual interfacing has permeated nearly every aspect of our daily lives. A seemingly endless stream of technological advances combined with our newfound reliance on virtual interfacing makes it likely that humans will continue to use this modern form of social interaction into the future. However, emergent evidence suggests that virtual interfacing may not be equivalent to face-to-face interactions. Ultimately, too little is currently understood about the mechanisms that underlie human interactions over the virtual divide, including how these mechanisms differ from traditional face-to-face interaction. Here, we propose functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning-simultaneous measurement of two or more brains-as an optimal approach to quantify potential neurocognitive differences between virtual and in-person interactions. We argue that increased focus on this understudied domain will help elucidate the reasons why virtual conferencing doesn't always stack up to in-person meetings and will also serve to spur new technologies designed to improve the virtual interaction experience. On the basis of existing fNIRS hyperscanning literature, we highlight the current gaps in research regarding virtual interactions. Furthermore, we provide insight into current hurdles regarding fNIRS hyperscanning hardware and methodology that should be addressed in order to shed light on this newly critical element of everyday life.

Replicating the Dimensional Structure of Cannabis Problems: A Taxometric Analysis								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	1			81	86		10.1080/10826084.2020.1840589			JAN 2 2021	2021	Objective This study employed taxometric procedures to replicate a previous report of the dimensional structure of problems related to cannabis consumption. Method: Over 4,000 cannabis users completed an assessment of psychological, social, occupational, and physical harms (the Marijuana Problems Scale). Three taxometric procedures (MAMBAC, MAXEIG, and L-Mode) compared the current data to simulations with a base rate of problematic cannabis use derived from representative, large-scale data estimates. Results: All three procedures confirmed the continuous, dimensional nature of these cannabis problems and suggested no underlying taxon or category. Conclusions: Psychopathological disorders, including some substance use problems, have fit categorical models suggesting that they differ in kind (rather than intensity) from the behavior of the rest of the population. Cannabis problems, however, appeared to lie along a continuum with other forms of use. Given heightened awareness for the necessity of replication and a changing legal landscape for cannabis, a second look at the dimensionality of these problems seemed warranted. New data with a larger sample and different indices of problematic use confirmed the dimensionality of cannabis problems. This replication can inform predictions about the etiology, prevention, and treatment of cannabis use disorder. Researchers should expect cannabis problems to range along a continuum without categorical distinctions. Dividing users into groups of problematic and non-problematic users likely sacrifices meaningful variance. Harm reduction strategies likely can benefit all users rather than a targeted taxon with troubles. In addition, interventions will likely progress by small, incremental steps rather than dramatic, categorical jumps in progress.

Method: The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, 2012-2013, sampled, recruited, and assessed 36,309 adults, with interviews on drug use and other characteristics. The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule DSM-5 Version (AUDADIS-5) was used to identify psychiatric conditions. Latent class models were developed based on various psychiatric diagnoses. Multinomial logistic regression estimated the significance of covariates in predicting class membership. Results: Four latent classes optimally distinguished the population: no comorbid conditions (63%), comorbid affective disorders (16%), those with alcohol use disorder (AUD; 17%), and a highly comorbid subgroup (i.e., co-occurring affective and drug use disorders; 4%). Current smoking was about twice as prevalent in the classes defined by psychiatric conditions compared to the group with no comorbid conditions. The highly comorbid class was more likely to be current smokers than the comorbid affective disorders class and the AUD class. Furthermore, the highly comorbid class was younger and had lower income, and the AUD class had a higher proportion of males than the other classes. Conclusions: Cigarette smoking was higher in the nearly 40% of respondents characterized by psychiatric disorders, particularly those with drug use disorders. Correlates of membership in these classes were consistent with known vulnerabilities for smoking, highlighting the need for mental health interventions and future research to explicitly address tobacco cessation in clinical settings based on psychiatric diagnoses.

This study aims to clarify the effects of latent toxoplasmosis on infected mice's behavior and to assess the dopamine neurotransmitter in their brains. Experimental infection with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and monitoring of behavioral alterations in mice using open field and hole-board tests were carried. Mice were sacrificed, then brains histo-pathologically and neuro-chemically assessed. Open field test revealed a decrease in locomotion in both infected mice genders, whereas the hole-board test displayed an increased level of exploration only by infected female mice. Significant changes in the dopamine concentration in the brain with regard to status of infection were detected. The results suggest an association between T. gondii infection and changes in the behavior. Neuromodulators may represent an ideal mechanism by which T. gondii, at least in part of the expression, can influence the behavior of the infected animal or even human host.

There is a paucity of systematic studies in India examining the efficacy of self-management programs for diabetes. The study examined the impact of a brief self-management intervention (SMI) on primary outcome of HbA1c and secondary outcomes of quality of life (QOL), self-care, perceived barriers to self-care (BSC), perceptions regarding illness and mood in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and materials: Eighty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly allocated to either a 4-session SMI or treatment as usual (TAU) and were assessed on HbA1c levels, QOL, self-care, BSC, illness perceptions, anxiety, and depression at baseline, postintervention , and at three-month postintervention follow-up. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated significant improvement in the SMI group from baseline to follow-up on HbA1c (P = 0.001), impact of diabetes on QOL (P = 0.006), self-care with respect to diet and exercise (Ps = 0.001), perceived barriers in adherence to diet, exercise, (P = 0.001), medication (P < 0.01), glucose testing (P = 0.04), general BSC (P = 0.001), total barriers (P = 0.001), illness perceptions-timeline or chronicity of illness (P = 0.002), personal control over illness, (P = 0.001), belief in effectiveness of treatment (P = 0.002), understanding of one's illness (P = 0.001), and emotional representations regarding illness (P =0.001), depression, (P = 0.001), and anxiety (P = 0.001). In the SMI group, large effect sizes were obtained at the postintervention assessment and the three-month follow-up on most outcome measures.

The current study aimed to assess psychological distress, coping, and perceived social support of spouses of women with postpartum onset severe mental illness. Methodology: A cross-sectional descriptive research design was used, and 30 spouses of the women admitted to the mother-baby unit (MBU) for psychiatric inpatient care were included in the study. The assessments included sociodemographic details, Kessler psychological distress scale (K10), brief coping orientation to problems experienced scale (brief COPE), and Zimets' multidimensional scale of perceived social support. Results: Around 50% of the spouses experienced severe psychological distress. Nearly 40% of spouses reported poor coping and 56.7% of spouses had moderate social support from family and friends.

Feasibility, Acceptability and Usage Patterns of a 24-Hour Mobile Phone Helpline Service for Women Discharged from a Mother-Baby Psychiatry Unit (MBU) in India								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	6			530	534		10.1177/0253717620954148			NOV 2020	2020	Background: For women with perinatal mental illness, phone helplines may be a useful way of accessing help. This study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, limitations, and usage patterns of a helpline service for mothers discharged from a mother-baby psychiatry unit. Methods: Mothers discharged from a mother baby unit during an 18-month period were provided with a helpline number. A social worker answered the calls. Details of the calls, including the reasons and the interventions provided, were recorded. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by calling all users and nonusers. Satisfaction with the helpline was recorded among users, and reasons for not calling were assessed among nonusers. Results: Among 113 mothers, 51 (45%) made 248 calls. Calls were regarding medication, sleep problems, planning pregnancies, symptom exacerbation, appointments, and suicidal ideation. Some calls were related to domestic violence (n = 13, 5.24%), and infant health and breastfeeding (n = 11, 4.44%). Seventy-six (67%, 44 callers and 32 noncallers) were contacted. The majority (41/44) of the callers found it useful: 91% said they got help, and 95% said they would recommend it to others. However, language difficulties (9%) and technical problems (5%) were reported. Among the noncallers, the majority reported having experienced no problem related to mental health or had contacted a doctor. However, of the noncallers, one woman died of suicide, did not have access to a phone, and the family did not choose to call. Conclusions: Helpline phone service appears to be feasible and acceptable and can be adapted in other mother-baby psychiatry units in low and middle-income countries. However, in some women, the nonavailability of a phone may be a limiting factor.

Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure self-reported depressive symptoms. The multivariate approach of the general linear model was used to evaluate the mean differences of depression scores among the trimesters. To investigate the associated factors of depressive symptoms, generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to take into account the clustering effect. Results: More than half (58.13%) of the pregnant women had antenatal depressive symptoms in at least one trimester. Depressive symptoms decreased throughout the pregnancy; they were higher in the first trimester and declined toward the third trimester. Significant mean differences were found in depression scores among the three trimesters. GEE showed that trimester, education, family income, and body mass index (BMI) are significantly associated with antenatal depressive symptoms. Conclusions: First trimester is the most critical period for identification of depressive symptoms. At-risk women need to be treated. Proper education achievement, economic solvency, and adequate nutrition could reduce the depressive symptoms.

This article focuses on the use of structural family therapy with a client diagnosed with Dissociative Disorder. An in-dept analysis of the case was done by using case study design. The Case Study is presented with client's background, individual assessment, family assessment, the treatment plan with techniques and outcome of interventions. Individual assessment showed that client had low self-esteem, poor problem-solving skills, insecure attachment and inter-personal conflict with the father. Family assessment revealed that client was never allowed to explore and develop according to his individual and unique characteristics. As he grew older the mother became more enmeshed and father became too rigid in terms of his expectation from the client. In order to reduce tensions between parents and cope up with stressful situation client started dissociating. Individual therapy focused on enhancing client's current level of functioning, improving his coping skills and learning to be more assertive in a relationship. Therapy with family emphasized on restructuring unhealthy boundaries by regulating power dynamics within relationship and correcting dysfunctional hierarchies. The outcome of interventions was improvement in family's functioning, interaction pattern and changes in power dynamics within relationship.

Methods: Patients presenting for routine and sick visits were asked to participate in electronic suicide risk screening using the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions tool; screen positive individuals were assessed with the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions Brief Suicide Safety Assessment. Screening program feasibility was evaluated by the proportion of patients consenting to participate, participant Ask Suicide-Screening Questions and Brief Suicide Safety Assessment completion rates, and response to a question asking whether primary care providers should ask about suicide. Screening impact was evaluated quasi-experimentally by comparing electronic medical record documentation of suicide risk screening, assessment, and risk determination in practice patients before and after implementing the screening program. Results: Over half of the patients approached agreed to participate in a research study about suicide (N = 196; 57.7%). Feasibility of the screening program was demonstrated by the high completion rates for the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (99.0%) and the Brief Suicide Safety Assessment (100.0%) among study participants. Additionally, 95.4% (N = 187) of participants agreed primary care providers should screen patients for suicide. Suicide screening rates rose significantly between the baseline and intervention phases (5.8% to 61.0%; X-2 = 200.61, P < 0.001), as did suicide risk detection rates (0.7% to 6.2%; X-2 = 12.58, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Suicide risk screening was feasible and well accepted by adult patients in rural primary care and has potential to improve suicide risk detection in this setting.

Strategies to Mitigate Clinician Implicit Bias Against Sexual and Gender Minority Patients								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	6			655	661					NOV-DEC 2020	2020	Background: Implicit bias is an ingrained, unconscious cultural stereotype that can negatively affect a person's interactions with members of stigmatized groups, including sexual and gender minorities. Clinician implicit biases may negatively impact the quality of patient care. Methods: This article uses 4 case scenarios to illustrate how implicit bias among psychiatrists and other clinicians can affect patient-clinician communication and diminish the quality of health care provided to sexual and gender minority people. We offer strategies for clinicians to recognize, challenge, and address implicit bias. Discussion: Through continuing education, self-reflection, and practice, psychiatrists and other clinicians can improve communication and foster more affirming care experiences for their sexual and gender minority patients, with the goal of addressing and ultimately eliminating sexual and gender minority health disparities.

Optimizing Fit: Targeting a Residency Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Rotation to Various Levels of Training								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	6			645	654					NOV-DEC 2020	2020	Background: Determining the optimal timing and structure for a core residency rotation in consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) remains a key challenge for program directors and rotation leaders. Previous surveys have been conducted regarding these questions, and guidelines from national organizations have been issued, but practices remain varied among institutions. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the literature related to the timing of CLP rotations and generated consensus recommendations based on our experience as program directors, rotation leaders, and residents. Results: Explicit goals of CLP training in residency include identifying and treating psychiatric manifestation of medical illness and communicating effectively with primary teams. Implicit goals of training may includeconflict management, limit setting, and "thinking dirty." Discussion: Although CLP rotations earlier in residency often create a better fit within the overarching curriculum and allow for generating early interest in the field, significant amounts of supervision are required, and consultees may look to attendings as the primary consultant. Conversely, while later rotations are sometimes challenging to structure with other outpatient responsibilities, they allow for greater autonomy and may map better onto the informal curriculum. A hybrid model, with training spread across multiple years, is another approach that may mitigate some of the disadvantages of confining consultation-liaison training to a single year. Compelling arguments can be made for placing the core CLP rotation in postgraduate year 2 or 3 or using a hybrid model. Regardless of placement, program directors and rotation leaders should be mindful of tailoring the rotation to the trainees' developmental stage.

Objective: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the creation of a multidisciplinary consultation-liaison (C-L) team, integrated with a psychiatric C-L team, together can decrease sitter use and improve outcomes using nonpharmacologic interventions. Methods: This retrospective study describes the planning, implementation, and data collection using in creating an multidisciplinary C-L team to collaborate with the psychiatric C-L team and outcomes to support the approach. The multidisciplinary C-L team was composed of advanced practice registered nurses and creative art therapists. The teams worked closely with the medical units to develop and monitor criteria for sitter use. The key outcomes of the intervention improved patient safety and reduced overall cost. Results: In the first year of implementation of a multidisciplinary C-L approach, sitter use decreased by 72%. Nonpharmacologic interventions improved patient outcomes by providing education to medical staff that enhanced the assessment and implementation of enhanced observer use across all the medical units. Subsequent data also reflect a sustained reduction in cost over the next 2-year period, saving the institution nearly $70K a month. Conclusion: An multidisciplinary C-L and psychiatric C-L team collaborated on the need for psychiatric medications, or nonpharmacologic interventions to address behaviors and decrease the need for an enhanced observer. The teams worked together to make policy revisions and algorithms and provide education, the result of which was significant financial savings and improved patient safety.

Design and Implementation of a Regional Inpatient Psychiatry Unit for Patients who are Positive for Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	6			662	671					NOV-DEC 2020	2020	Background: Patients with psychiatric illnesses are particularly vulnerable to highly contagious, droplet-spread organisms such as SARS-CoV-2. Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces, with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion. Objective: With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and share key points for consideration in implementing future units elsewhere. Conclusion: A major takeaway point of the analysis is the particular expertise of trained experts in psychosomatic medicine for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Addiction Management in Hospitalized Patients With Intravenous Drug Use-Associated Infective Endocarditis								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	6			678	687		10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.019			NOV-DEC 2020	2020	Background: Infections related to intravenous drug use and opioid use disorders (OUDs) are increasing nationwide. Endocarditis is a recognized complication of intravenous drug use, and inpatient treatment typically focuses on infection management without attention to underlying addiction. Objective: A comprehensive intervention for inpatients with infective endocarditis and intravenous drug use was implemented by a multidisciplinary team at a large midwestern hospital. The team included behavioral health/addiction medicine, infectious disease, pain medicine, cardiothoracic surgery, pharmacy, and nursing to address the OUD while managing the infection. The intervention was assessed by measuring the initiation of medication-assisted treatment and endocarditis-related readmissions. Methods: Patients were identified from the medical records using discharge diagnosis codes for OUDs and infective endocarditis. In addition to medical management of infective endocarditis, the multidisciplinary intervention included early involvement of addiction medicine and the pain management at the time of admission. Patient interventions included education, motivational interviewing, behavioral health engagement, collaborative pain management, individual/family therapy, medication evaluation, and initiation of medication-assisted treatment. Caregivers were also educated on OUDs and ways to support patients undergoing interventions. Results: Both the historical control group (N = 37) and the intervention group (N = 33) were comparable in age, gender, race, marital status, psychiatric history, and smoking but differed by employment status, religious affiliation, and use of psychiatric medications. At discharge, 18.9% of the control group and 54.5% in the intervention group were initiated on medication-assisted treatment for OUDs. No differences in readmission rates were found. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary teams for treating inpatients with intravenous drug use and infective endocarditis are feasible and can increase the uptake of OUD-specific treatment.

J	Allen, Nicole; Mishkin, Adrienne								The Incapacitated Surrogate: What is the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist's Role?								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	6			672	677					NOV-DEC 2020	2020	Background: When a patient is found to be lacking capacity to make a medical decision, the medical team is advised to turn to the patient's most appropriate surrogate decision maker (hereafter, surrogate) to make a choice on behalf of the patient. The assumption made by the medical team is that the surrogate will have the capacity to make appropriate medical decisions on behalf of the patient. At times though, the capacity of the surrogate himself may be called into question, leading to uncertainty in terms of how best to proceed in the care of the patient. Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are commonly consulted to assess a patient's capacity to make a particular medical decision, but their role assisting in cases of incapacitated surrogates is less clear. Objective: In this article, we summarize the existing literature and current state laws regarding incapacitated surrogates and propose guidelines for the role the consultation-liaison psychiatrist can take when the surrogate may be incapacitated.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of a proactive model on LOS, consult rate, and consultation latency in a nonacademic community hospital. Methods: We implemented a modified proactive consultation-liaison service (PCS) in a 32-bed acute care medical-surgical unit in a community hospital. We compared outcomes during a 90-day PCS intervention period to preintervention and postintervention cohorts receiving consultation-as-usual in the same unit. During the intervention, a psychiatrist reviewed the electronic medical record of patients admitted to the study unit to guide recommendations and collaborated with existing unit staff. Primary outcomes were LOS, consultation rate, and consultation latency. Secondary outcomes included restraint utilization, 1:1 companion utilization, and a survey completed by unit nursing staff. Results: Half of patients on the study unit had psychiatric comorbidity. Median LOS in the PCS cohort was 3.0 days versus 5.0 days in the preintervention and postintervention cohorts. The consultation rate was higher in the PCS cohort (1.4% before intervention; 33% intervention; 6.5% after intervention), and median consultation latency was also reduced during the intervention (57.6 h before intervention; 19.2 h intervention; 48 h after intervention). Conclusions: Implementation of a modified PCS model is feasible in a community hospital setting and can reduce LOS, enhance psychiatric service utilization, and reduce consultation latency. This study demonstrates that proactive consultation-liaison may offer the same benefits to nonacademic community hospitals as it does to large academic centers.

Using the pediatric Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) development study as a model, this study aimed to determine whether the ASQ is a valid suicide risk-screening instrument for use among adults medical patients, as well as to evaluate a set of other potential screening questions for use in adults. Methods: Adult patients hospitalized on inpatient medical/surgical units from 4 hospitals were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional instrument-validation study. The 4-item ASQ and other candidate items were compared against the 25-item, previously validated Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire as the criterion standard. Results: A total of 727 adult medical inpatients completed the screening process. Compared with the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, the ASQ performed best among the full set of candidate items, demonstrating strong psychometric properties, with a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval=90%-100%), a specificity of 89%(95% confidence interval = 86%-91%), and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% confidence interval = 99%-100%). A total of 4.8% (35/727) of the participants screened positive for suicide risk based on the standard criterion Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire. Conclusions: The ASQ is a valid and brief suicide risk-screening tool for use among adults. Screening medical/surgical inpatients for suicide risk can be performed effectively for both adult and pediatric patients using this brief, primary screener.

J	Oh, Sehun; Salas-Wright, Christopher P.; Vaughn, Michael G.; Zapcic, Ian								Substance Misuse Profiles of Women in Families Receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Benefits: Findings from a National Sample								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			798	807					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: Women in families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance are twice as likely to have a substance use disorder (SUD) than their non-TANF counterparts in the past year. However, evidence is limited about substance misuse patterns and comorbid mental health problems among women in TANF families. Method: Data from the 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health were used to examine the prevalence of substance misuse and use disorders among women age 18 or older in TANF families. We used latent class analysis to identify subgroups of distinctive substance misuse behaviors and tested the associations between SUD/serious psychological distress (SPD) and the group classification. Results: Despite higher odds of having an SUD in all substance categories than their non-TANF counterparts, more than 84% of the women in TANF families were considered to have low substance misuse risks. Of the three identified at-risk groups, the polysubstance and the prescription pain reliever and alcohol misuse groups reported higher risks of having an SUD and SPD than the low-risk group. Individuals at risk of marijuana and alcohol misuse, represented by young, Black mothers, reported the lowest rates of treatment receipt despite having past-year SUD, SPD, or both. Conclusions: Although special attention needs to be paid to integrated care for those at risk of multiple substance misuse, additional efforts are required to increase substance abuse and mental health treatment among women at risk of marijuana and alcohol misuse.

J	Stuart, Geoffrey W.; Yip, Dominic; Hogendoorn, Hinze								The role of hue in visual search for texture differences: Implications for camouflage design								VISION RESEARCH				176				16	26		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.008			NOV 2020	2020	The purpose of camouflage is to be inconspicuous against a given background. Colour is an important component of camouflage, and the task of designing a single camouflage pattern for use against multiple different backgrounds is particularly challenging. As it is impossible to match the colour gamut of each background exactly, the question arises which colours from the different backgrounds should be incorporated in a camouflage pattern to achieve optimal concealment. Here, we used a visual search paradigm to address this question. Observers searched multi-coloured continuous textures for target regions defined by either the presence or absence of additional hues. Targets could be either a combination of five hues against a four-hued background ("patches"), or a combination of four hues against a five-hued background ("holes"). In Experiment 1, a search asymmetry was observed for the different targets, as observers were less accurate and slower at detecting holes than patches. Additionally, we observed a linear separability effect: search for a target was more difficult when the hue that defined the target was within the gamut of distractor colours (e.g. orange amongst reds and yellows). In Experiment 2, we further investigated "hole" targets designed for two different backgrounds and found that optimal concealment against both backgrounds was achieved by including intermediate colours that represented a compromise between the common colours and the unique colours of each background. The findings provide insights into how search asymmetries can be extended to complex texture properties and help inform the design process of camouflage for multiple backgrounds.

J	Wendt, Gunnar; Faul, Franz								The role of contrast polarities in binocular luster: Low-level and high-level processes								VISION RESEARCH				176				141	155		10.1016/j.visres.2020.08.006			NOV 2020	2020	The binocular fusion of two center-surround configurations, where one center is brighter, the other darker than the common surround, leads to a strong impression of luster in the central patch. Without reversed contrast polarities of the center patches, this impression is much weaker or even absent. However, we observed that in the latter case the perceived luster can be considerably enhanced by enclosing both centers with a thin ring of fixed luminance. Compared to the standard stimulus, this center-ring-surround configuration shows much less binocular rivalry and the luster has also a different, more glass-like material quality. In a psychophysical experiment, we examined how the magnitude of the lustrous response depends on the width of the ring, both in stimuli with reversed and consistent contrast polarities. It has been proposed that binocular luster results from a neuronal conflict between ON and OFF visual pathways. To test this hypothesis with respect to our data, we developed a simple model to estimate the amount of interocular conflict resulting from a given binocular stimulus pair and applied it to all stimuli used in the experiment. We found strong correlations between the interocular conflict measure and the strength of luster observed in the experiment, suggesting that a common low-level mechanism determines the magnitude of the lustrous response. Regarding the differences in the perceived material quality of the lustrous impressions, we discuss evidence indicating that high-level processes are involved that promote the visual system's interpretation of the ring-stimuli as a certain depth-segmented 3D scene.

How the rest of the visual space is affected by this size adaptation, however, has not been systematically studied before. Here, to fill this gap in literature, we tested size adaptation at the adapter location as well as the rest of the visual space. We used peripherally presented solid discs (Experiment 1) and rings (Experiment 2) as adapter and target (test) stimuli. Observers adapted to a mid-sized stimulus and judged the size of the subsequently presented smaller or larger target stimuli. Results showed that the perceived sizes of target stimuli were repelled away from the adapter size, not only at the adapter location but also at other locations. These findings demonstrate that size adaptation causes widespread distortion of the visual space and alters perceived size. We discuss possible computational models that may underpin the perceptual effect.

Method: We obtained survey data from 1,037 married, cohabiting, or partnered patients (53% female; 50% Hispanic; 29% African American) at a Northern California safety-net hospital. Past-year physical IPV was measured with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. We asked patients about frequency of drinking and usual number of drinks consumed at bars, restaurants, homes of friends or relatives, own home, public places such as street corners or parking lots, and community centers or large events. Gender-stratified dose-response models were estimated for frequencies of IPV perpetration and victimization, with adjustment for sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, marijuana use, and spouse/partner problem drinking. Results: None of the women's context-based frequency and volume measures were associated with frequency of IPV victimization. Women's volume of alcohol consumed at home was associated positively with frequency of their IPV perpetration (beta = .008, SE = .003, p < .01), and volume consumed in public places was associated negatively with this outcome (beta = -.023, SE = .010, p < .05). Among men, none of the context-based frequency and volume measures were associated with frequency of either IPV outcome. Spouse/partner's problem drinking was associated with each gender's IPV victimization, and with IPV perpetration by men. Conclusions: Frequency of drinking and volume consumed in specific contexts do not substantively contribute to frequency of IPV perpetration or victimization in this sample of urban ED patients.

The Relationship Between Polysubstance Injection Drug Use, HIV Risk Behaviors, and Interest in Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Among People Who Inject Drugs in Rural West Virginia								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			740	749					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: The opioid crisis has increased risks for injection drug use (IDU)-associated HIV outbreaks throughout the United States. Polysubstance use and syringe sharing are common among rural people who inject drugs (PWID). However, little is known about how polysubstance IDU affects engagement in HIV prevention efforts among non-urban PWID. This study assesses the associations between profiles of polysubstance injection, injection-related HIV risk, acquiring syringes from a syringe services program (SSP), HIV testing, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and interest among PWID in rural Appalachia. Method: We used survey data from 392 respondents in Cabell County, West Virginia who had injected drugs in the past 6 months. We conducted a latent class analysis using seven measures of IDU and tested for associations with injection-related HIV risk, receiving syringes from an SSP, having been tested for HIV, and PrEP awareness and interest. Results: We identified three classes of polysubstance IDU in our sample: polysubstance use, heroin and crystal methamphetamine use, and crystal methamphetamine and buprenorphine/suboxone use. The polysubstance use class had the highest injection-related HIV risk (81.8% at risk), high syringe acquisition at an SSP (67.7%), and highest rate of HIV testing (60.0%). PrEP awareness was low across the sample (30.0%), but most PWID expressed interest in using PrEP (57.7%). Conclusions: Patterns of polysubstance IDU have unique relationships with key HIV risk factors and protective behaviors. The expansion of harm reduction services in rural settings is warranted to prevent incident HIV infections.

J	Dyar, Christina; Bradley, Heather; Morgan, Ethan; Sullivan, Patrick S.; Mustanski, Brian								Reduction and Cessation of Alcohol, Cannabis, and Stimulant Use: Prospective Associations With Changes in Depressive Symptoms Across Two Cohort Studies of Sexual and Gender Minorities								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			790	797					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are at increased risk for substance use and depression. However, little research has examined the directionality of associations between substance use and depression in this high-risk population, and we are not aware of any to parse associations between depression and changes in the frequency of substance use versus substance use cessation. Such research can help to inform the development of future interventions to address health disparities affecting SGM. Method: We used data from two longitudinal cohorts of SGM assigned male at birth (SGM-AMAB; N = 1,418) to examine associations between changes in frequency of alcohol, cannabis, and stimulant use and depressive symptoms. Multilevel models tested whether changes in substance use predicted changes in depressive symptoms and vice versa. Results: Results indicate that when SGM-AMAB decreased their alcohol use or ceased alcohol, cannabis, or stimulant use, they experienced concurrent decreases in depressive symptoms. Only reducing stimulant use (not alcohol or cannabis use) was associated with decreases in depressive symptoms over the subsequent 6 months. Depressive symptoms did not prospectively predict cessation or reduction in the use of any substance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that clinical interventions targeting substance use may simultaneously reduce depressive symptoms and that reductions in alcohol use (even in the absence of cessation) may simultaneously benefit mental health among SGM-AMAB. The limited evidence of prospective effects over 6 months suggests that studies with shorter lags may be better equipped to examine the directionality of the association between depressive symptoms and substance use/reduction.

J	Stafford, Julia; Kypri, Kypros; Pettigrew, Simone								Industry Actor Use of Research Evidence: Critical Analysis of Australian Alcohol Policy Submissions								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			710	718					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: Governments' limited adoption of evidence-based policies to reduce alcohol-related harm has been partly attributed to alcohol industry influence. A better understanding of industry political strategy may help protect public policy against vested interests. We examined how industry actors used scientific evidence in their submissions to government alcohol policy consultations. Method: We conducted a content analysis of 214 submissions from industry actors in 21 Australian public consultations between 2013 and 2017. Represented industry actors included alcohol producers and retailers, trade associations, licensees, and associated entities that derive commercial benefit from alcohol (e.g., advertising companies). Adapting an existing framework, we classified industry practices into two categories: (a) misuse of evidence and (b) denial of the effectiveness of evidence-based strategies. Results: Almost all submissions (91%) denied the effectiveness of evidence-based strategies; the most common denial practices were making unsubstantiated claims about adverse effects of policies (76%) and promoting alternatives without evidence (71%). The misuse of scientific evidence was apparent in 66% of submissions. Trade associations, producers, and retailers were most likely to use such practices. Conclusions: The extent to which the examined industry actors misused scientific evidence in their submissions to a wide range of alcohol policy consultations in Australia suggests the need for governments to consider excluding the industry from consultation on the regulation of alcohol.

A Swedish National Study								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			816	823					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether ease of access to alcohol at the neighborhood level moderates the impact of familial liability and marital status on risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Method: Individuals in Sweden were divided into those residing in a neighborhood with (n = 14.1%) versus without (n = 85.9%) an alcohol outlet (bars/nightclubs or government stores). AUD was detected through national medical, legal, and pharmacy registries. Using an additive model predicting AUD registration over 5 years in 1,624,814 individuals, we tested for interactions between the presence of outlets in the individuals' neighborhoods and familial risk for externalizing syndromes and marital status. Results: In both males and females, we found positive and significant interactions in the prediction of AUD between the presence versus absence of a nearby alcohol outlet with (a) familial risk and (b) single and divorced versus married status. Similar but nonsignificant interactions were seen between nearby outlets and widowed versus married status. These results changed little when all cases with prior AUD were removed from the sample. For males, most of the interaction arose from the proximity of bars/nightclubs, whereas for females the results varied across different kinds of outlets. Conclusions: Environments that provide easy access to alcohol augment the impact of a range of risk factors for AUD, especially familial vulnerability and the reduced social constraints associated with single, divorced, and widowed marital status.

Modelling binocular disparity processing from statistics in natural scenes								VISION RESEARCH				176				27	39		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.009			NOV 2020	2020	The statistics of our environment impact not only our behavior, but also the selectivity and connectivity of the early sensory cortices. Over the last fifty years, powerful theories such as efficient coding, sparse coding, and the infomax principle have been proposed to explain the nature of this influence. Numerous computational and theoretical studies have since demonstrated solid, testable evidence in support of these theories, especially in the visual domain. However, most such work has concentrated on monocular, luminance-field descriptions of natural scenes, and studies that systematically focus on binocular processing of realistic visual input have only been conducted over the past two decades. In this review, we discuss the most recent of these binocular computational studies, with particular emphasis on disparity selectivity. We begin with a report of the relevant literature demonstrating concrete evidence for the relationship between natural disparity statistics, neural selectivity, and behavior. This is followed by a discussion of supervised and unsupervised computational studies. For each study, we include a description of the input data, theoretical principles employed in the models, and the contribution of the results in explaining biological data (neural and behavioral). In the discussion, we compare these models to the binocular energy model, and examine their application to the modelling of normal and abnormal development of vision. We conclude with a short description of what we believe are the most important limitations of the current state-of-the-art, and directions for future work which could address these shortcomings and enrich current and future models.

VISION RESEARCH				176				80	90		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.013			NOV 2020	2020	When remembering an object at a given location, participants tend to return their gaze to that location even after the object has disappeared, known as Looking-at-Nothing (LAN). However, it is unclear whether LAN is associated with better memory performance. Previous studies reporting beneficial effects of LAN have often not systematically manipulated or assessed eye movements. We asked 20 participants to remember the location and identity of eight objects arranged in a circle, shown for 5 s. Participants were prompted to judge whether a location statement (e.g., "Star Right") was correct or incorrect, or referred to a previously unseen object. During memory retrieval, participants either fixated in the screen center or were free to move their eyes. Results reveal no difference in memory accuracy and response time between free-viewing and fixation while a LAN effect was found for saccades during free viewing, but not for microsaccades during fixation. Memory performance was better in those free-viewing trials in which participants made a saccade to the critical location, and scaled with saccade accuracy. These results indicate that saccade kinematics might be related to both memory performance and memory retrieval processes, but the strength of their link would differ between individuals and task demands.

J	Simhi, Noa; Yovel, Galit								Can we recognize people based on their body-alone? The roles of body motion and whole person context								VISION RESEARCH				176				91	99		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.012			NOV 2020	2020	While most studies on person recognition examine the face alone, recent studies have shown evidence for the contribution of the body and gait to person recognition beyond the face. Nevertheless, little is known on whether person recognition can be performed based on the body alone. In this study, we examined two sources of information that may enhance body-based person recognition: body motion and whole person context. Body motion has been shown to contribute to person recognition especially when facial information is unclear. Additionally, generating whole person context, by attaching faceless heads to bodies, has been shown to activate face processing mechanisms and may therefore enhance body-based person recognition. To assess body-based person recognition, participants performed a sequential matching task in which they studied a video of a person walking followed by a headless image of the same or different identity. The role of body motion was examined by comparing recognition from dynamic vs. static headless bodies. The role of whole person context was examined by comparing bodies with and without faceless heads. Our findings show that person recognition from the body alone was better in dynamic vs. static displays indicating that body motion contributed to body-based person recognition. In addition, whole person context contributed to body-based person recognition when recognition was performed in static displays. Overall these findings show that recognizing people based on their body alone is challenging but can be performed under certain circumstances that enhance the processing of the body when seeing the whole dynamic person.

Changes in Alcohol Consumption Among College Students Due to COVID-19: Effects of Campus Closure and Residential Change								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			725	730					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: It is well established that college students increase their drinking when they leave home. This study examined changes in drinking as a result of campus closure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), focusing on the influence of living situation. Method: A sample of 312 college students (mean age = 21.2 years; 62% female; 67% White) responded to an online survey regarding their drinking behavior before and after university closures because of COVID-19. Those participants who lived with peers pre-closure and moved home to live with parents post-closure were compared with those who remained living with peers or remained living with parents in terms of changes in frequency and quantity of drinking. Results: A comparison of pre- to post-closure drinking indicated significant decreases in the typical num- ber of drinks per week (from 11.5 to 9.9) and maximum drinks per day (from 4.9 to 3.3) and a slight increase in typical drinking days per week (from 3 to 3.2). Patterns of change significantly varied across groups. Those who moved from peers to parents showed significantly greater reductions in drinking days (from 3.1 to 2.7), number of drinks per week (from 13.9 to 8.5), and maximum drinks in one day (from 5.4 to 2.9) than those who remained living with peers or with parents. In contrast, the latter two groups significantly increased their frequency (from 3.0 to 3.7 days and 2.0 to 3.3 days, respectively). Conclusions: Participants reduced their quantity of drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Returning to live with parents during emerging adulthood may be protective for heavy drinking.

J	Asher, Jordi M.; Hibbard, Paul B.								No effect of feedback, level of processing or stimulus presentation protocol on perceptual learning when easy and difficult trials are interleaved								VISION RESEARCH				176				100	117		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.011			NOV 2020	2020	The role of feedback during training is a topic of great theoretical importance in perceptual learning. Feedback can be provided externally by the environment or internally by the observer. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of learning with internal versus external feedback, we performed a large multi-level experiment, varying the type of training task (Motion or Form), the level of processing (Local or Global), the presence of feedback (With or Without) and finally the method of stimulus presentation (Adaptive staircase or Method of constant stimuli). 140 participants were randomly assigned to one of ten groups and undertook 3 days of training in one condition only. Detection thresholds were measured daily before and after training with a pre- and post-assessment. A 75% detection threshold was calculated and used to estimate that day's training levels (65% and 85% accuracy for difficult and easy trials respectively). The group trained with MOCS were presented with predefined randomly interleaved easy and difficult trials ranging from 50% to 95% stimulus intensity. Our findings indicate that improvement was generally robust across training-tasks, processing levels and feedback conditions. This suggests that internal reinforcement is as effective as external feedback in a discrete-noise-paradigm for local and global tasks when easy and difficult trials are interleaved.

J	Kilian, Carolin; Manthey, Jakob; Rehm, Juergen								Gender Differences and the Role of Social Inequality in Alcohol's Harm to Others in Europe								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			762	769					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: The harm caused to individuals because of the consumption of alcohol by others has been shown to be a significant problem in Europe. The current study investigates gender differences in the experience of alcohol's harm to others (AHTO), taking the victim-perpetrator relationship and social inequality (gender and income inequality) into account. Method: Data were obtained from the Standardized European Alcohol Survey in 2015, which comprised 28,182 individuals from 17 jurisdictions. AHTO was indicated by the experience of at least one harmful event in the past year because of another person's drinking. Multinomial logistic regression models were run to examine AHTO (a) by a known person's drinking, (b) by a stranger's drinking, and (c) by both a known person's and a stranger's drinking. Surveyweighted regressions were performed for gender, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Gini index, and the respective Gender x Inequality interactions. Results: Women were more likely than men to experience AHTO because of a known person's drinking, whereas men were at a higher risk of harm resulting from a stranger's drinking, or by both a known person's and a stranger's drinking. Independent of the victim-perpetrator relationship, AHTO was related to higher levels of gender and income inequality. With increasing income inequality, gender differences in the experience of harm because of a known person's drinking or a stranger's drinking declined as the risk of reporting the former among men and the latter among women increases more steeply than by the opposite gender. Conclusions: As higher levels of AHTO were observed in jurisdictions with greater social inequality, reducing alcohol consumption and social inequalities should be key interventions in attempting to reduce AHTO in Europe.

Neighborhood Context and Drug Use Among Mexican Americans on and off the US-Mexico Border								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			770	779					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: Prior research has suggested that drug use rates may be high at the U.S.-Mexico border, but in more recent research rates varied significantly between border communities. This study reports findings on the mediating influence of neighborhood-level variables on the observed difference in past-year drug use rates between two border sites and an interior site, focusing on Mexican Americans. Method: Data were analyzed from the U.S.-Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (UMSARC) on 1,345 Mexican-origin respondents ages 18-40 from the border sites of Laredo and Brownsville/McAllen compared with the nonborder site of San Antonio, separately for men and women. Neighborhood-level variables (based on census tracts and block groups) included drug availability, neighborhood insecurity, crime victimization, crime witnessing, off-premise alcohol outlet density, on-premise alcohol outlet density, percentage crossing the border more than 100 times, neighborhood disadvantage, residential stability, and percentage of White/non-Hispanic. Results: When individual sociodemographic characteristics were controlled for, lower drug use among men in Brownsville/McAllen (vs. San Antonio) was partially mediated by lower drug availability and lower perceived neighborhood insecurity whereas increased drug use among women in both Laredo and Brownsville/McAllen was partially mediated by the lower proportion of White/non-Hispanic residents compared with San Antonio. Conclusions: Neighborhood-level variables partially explain the heterogeneity in drug use across sites at the U.S.-Mexico border, but different factors appear to be operating for men compared with women. These findings suggest the potential importance of addressing neighborhood factors in reducing drug-related harm at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Watchers do not follow the eye movements of Walkers								VISION RESEARCH				176				130	140		10.1016/j.visres.2020.08.001			NOV 2020	2020	Eye movements are a functional signature of how the visual system effectively decodes and adapts to the environment. However, scientific knowledge in eye movements mostly arises from studies conducted in laboratories, with well-controlled stimuli presented in constrained unnatural settings. Only a few studies have attempted to directly compare and assess whether eye movement data acquired in the real world generalize with those in laboratory settings, with same visual inputs. However, none of these studies controlled for both the auditory signals typical of real-world settings and the top-down task effects across conditions, leaving this question unresolved. To minimize this inherent gap across conditions, we compared the eye movements recorded from observers during ecological spatial navigation in the wild (the Walkers) with those recorded in laboratory (the Watchers) on the same visual and auditory inputs, with both groups performing the very same active cognitive task. We derived robust data-driven statistical saliency and motion maps. The Walkers and Watchers differed in terms of eye movement characteristics: fixation number and duration, saccade amplitude. The Watchers relied significantly more on saliency and motion than the Walkers. Interestingly, both groups exhibited similar fixation patterns towards social agents and objects. Altogether, our data show that eye movements patterns obtained in laboratory do not fully generalize to real world, even when task and auditory information is controlled. These observations invite to caution when generalizing the eye movements obtained in laboratory with those of ecological spatial navigation.

Integration of contours defined by second-order contrast-modulation of texture								VISION RESEARCH				176				1	15		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.003			NOV 2020	2020	Boundaries in the visual world can be defined by changes in luminance and texture in the input image. A "contour integration" process joins together local changes into percepts of lines or edges. A previous study tested the integration of contours defined by second-order contrast-modulation. Their contours were placed in a background of random wavelets. Participants performed near chance. We re-visited second-order contour integration with a different task. Participants distinguished contours with "good continuation" from distractors. We measured thresholds in different amounts of external orientation or position noise. This gave two noise-masking functions. We also measured thresholds for contours with a baseline curvature to assess performance with more curvy targets. Our participants were able to discriminate the good continuation of second-order contours. Thresholds were higher than for first-order contours. In our modelling, we found this was due to multiple factors. There was a doubling of equivalent internal noise between first- and second-order contour integration. There was also a reduction in efficiency. The efficiency difference was only significant in our orientation noise condition. For both first- and second-order stimuli, participants were also able to perform our task with more curved contours. We conclude that humans can integrate second-order contours, even when they are curved. There is however reduced performance compared to first-order contours. We find both an impaired input to the integrating mechanism, and reduced efficiency seem responsible. Second-order contour integration may be more affected by the noise background used in the previous study. Difficulty segregating that background may explain their result.

I discuss working with Stanley Schachter and Murray Jarvik. Although I note the importance of Michael Russell (as do many colleagues), I draw attention to the considerable effect on my work of Edward Brecher through his 1972 book, Licit and Illicit Drugs. I give examples of the influence of the makers and sellers of nicotine-containing gum on my career in Canada and the United States as well as on the careers of several important colleagues.

VISION RESEARCH				176				60	71		10.1016/j.visres.2020.06.007			NOV 2020	2020	Various methods of measuring unit selectivity have been developed with the aim of better understanding how neural networks work. But the different measures provide divergent estimates of selectivity, and this has led to different conclusions regarding the conditions in which selective object representations are learned and the functional relevance of these representations. In an attempt to better characterize object selectivity, we undertake a comparison of various selectivity measures on a large set of units in AlexNet, including localist selectivity, precision, class-conditional mean activity selectivity (CCMAS), the human interpretation of activation maximization (AM) images, and standard signal-detection measures. We find that the different measures provide different estimates of object selectivity, with precision and CCMAS measures providing misleadingly high estimates. Indeed, the most selective units had a poor hit-rate or a high false-alarm rate (or both) in object classification, making them poor object detectors. We fail to find any units that are even remotely as selective as the 'grandmother cell' units reported in recurrent neural networks. In order to generalize these results, we compared selectivity measures on units in VGG-16 and GoogLeNet trained on the ImageNet or Places-365 datasets that have been described as 'object detectors'. Again, we find poor hit-rates and high false-alarm rates for object classification. We conclude that signal-detection measures provide a better assessment of single-unit selectivity compared to common alternative approaches, and that deep convolutional networks of image classification do not learn object detectors in their hidden layers.

The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effects of low intensity ambient lighting (dim light) on normal refractive development in macaque monkeys. Seven infant rhesus monkeys were reared under dim light (room illumination level: similar to 55 lx) from 24 to similar to 310 days of age with otherwise unrestricted vision. Refractive error, corneal power, ocular axial dimensions, and choroidal thickness were measured in anesthetized animals at the onset of the experiment and periodically throughout the dim-light-rearing period, and were compared with those of normal-light-reared monkeys. We found that dim light did not produce myopia; instead, dim-light monkeys were hyperopic relative to normal-light monkeys (median refractive errors at similar to 155 days, OD: + 3.13 D vs. + 2.31 D; OS: +3.31D vs. + 2.44 D; at similar to 310 days, OD: + 2.75D vs. + 1.78D, OS: +3.00D vs. + 1.75D). In addition, dim-light rearing caused sustained thickening in the choroid, but it did not alter corneal power development, nor did it change the axial nature of the refractive errors. These results showed that, for rhesus monkeys and possibly other primates, low ambient lighting by itself is not necessarily myopiagenic, but might compromise the efficiency of emmetropization.

To be used as such, sufficient test-retest reliability needs to be demonstrated. However, test-retest reliability is underinvestigated for event-related alpha asymmetry. The objective of this study was to examine both short-term within-session and long-term between-session reliability of stimulus-related medial and lateral frontal as well as parietal alpha EEG asymmetry in healthy subjects during a simple emotional face processing task. Twenty-three healthy adults participated in two sessions with a test-retest interval of about 1 week. Reliability was estimated with Pearson's correlation coefficient and paired t test. Results revealed moderate to high within-session reliability of stimulus-related alpha asymmetry for all electrode sites and both conditions. Alpha asymmetry mean values did not change significantly within sessions. Between-session reliability was fair for frontomedial and moderate for frontolateral stimulus-related asymmetry. Exploratory exclusion of subjects with unstable between-session self-rating scores of emotional state and empathy toward stimuli resulted in some higher reliability values. Our results indicate that stimulus-related alpha asymmetry may serve as a useful electrophysiological tool given its adequate within-session reliability. However, long-term stability of stimulus-related frontal alpha asymmetry over 1 week was comparatively low and varied depending on electrode position. Influencing state factors during EEG recording, such as current mood or stimulus engagement, should be considered in future study designs and analyses. Further, we recommend to analyze alpha asymmetry from both frontomedial and frontolateral sites.

J	Grossman, Daniel; Hamman, Mary								Changes in Opioid Overdose Emergency Encounters Associated with Expansion of Wisconsin Medicaid to Childless Adults in Poverty								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	6			750	759					NOV 2020	2020	Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure changes in the payer mix and incidence of emergency department (ED) opioid-related overdose encounters after an April 2014 expansion of Medicaid to childless adults led to a 43% increase in Medicaid coverage for men and 8% for women statewide. Method: We explored two competing hypotheses using data visualization and comparative interrupted time-series analysis (CITS): (a) expanded eligibility for Medicaid is associated with a change in payer mix only and (b) sociodemographic groups that gained Medicaid eligibility were more likely to use ED services for opioid overdose. Data included encounters at all Wisconsin nonfederal hospitals over 23 quarters from 2010 to 2015 and American Community Survey estimates of pre- and post-policy Medicaid eligibility by sex and age. Results: We found an increase in the share of opioid-related ED visits covered by Medicaid for men and women ages 19-29 and for men ages 30-49 following the expansion. The number of visits increased substantially in April 2014 for men ages 30-49, with Medicaid-covered visits driving this result. We found little evidence of an increase in overall visits for other age groups for either men or women. Conclusions: The relationship between Medicaid expansion and opioid ED use is complex. Changes in case mix and increased access to care likely both play a role in the overall increase in these ED visits. Being uninsured may be an important barrier to seeking emergency care for opioid-related overdoses.

Methods: Male Wistar rats (170 +/- 10 g) were injected with bi-daily doses (10 mg/kg, 12-h intervals) of morphine for 14 days. Rats receiving MMT were reared in the standard environment (SE) or EE during 30 days of morphine withdrawal. Then, the rats were tested for object recognition (the object recognition memory test, ORMT) and spatial learning and memory (the water maze) and then challenged with morphine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and evaluated for locomotor activity (open-field box). Results: The results revealed that the dependent/saline/EE (D/Sal/EE) and D/methadone/EE (D/Meth/EE) rats exhibited significant preference for the new object (p = 0.006 and p = 0.049), spent more time in the target zone (p = 0.045 and p = 0.005) on the water maze, and displayed a lower level of distance traveled (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0001) compared to their control groups reared in SE. Conclusions: We conclude that exposure to EE could ameliorate the object recognition and spatial memory deficits and also decrease locomotor sensitivity in morphine-withdrawn rats receiving MMT. Thus, EE may be beneficial in the treatment of addiction during MMT.

Orientation-dependency of perceptual surround suppression and orientation decoding of centre-surround stimuli are preserved with healthy ageing								VISION RESEARCH				176				72	79		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.015			NOV 2020	2020	A key visual neuronal property that is mirrored in human behaviour is centre-surround contrast suppression, which is orientation-dependent. When a target is embedded in a high-contrast surround, the centre appears reduced in contrast, the magnitude of which depends on the relative orientation between centre and surround. Previous reports demonstrate changes in perceptual surround suppression with ageing; however, whether the orientation-dependency of surround suppression is impacted by ageing has not been explored. Here, we tested 18 younger (aged 19-33) and 18 older (aged 60-77) adults. Perceptual surround suppression was stronger for parallel than orthogonal stimuli; however contrary to previous work, here we found no difference in perceptual suppression strength between age-groups. In the same participants, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and conducted multivariate pattern analysis to confirm that parallel and orthogonal centre-surround stimuli elicit distinguishable brain activity, predominantly over occipital areas. Despite a delay in the first prominent ERP component (P1) in response to each pattern, older adults showed similar decoding of orientation information (i.e. distinguish between parallel and orthogonal centre-surround stimuli from 70 ms post-stimulus onset) as younger adults. This suggests that sufficient information to distinguish orientation in centre-surround stimuli becomes available to the older human brain as early as in younger adults.

Despite the well-documented salience of peer environmental influences on adolescent drinking, it is not known whether peer environments moderate polygenic risks for trajectories of alcohol use. The current theoretically based investigation aimed to test developmental gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects across adolescence. Method: Latent growth curve models tested interactive associations of polygenic risk scores and adolescents' perceived friend drinking and disruptive behavior with adolescents' initial level of alcohol use frequency at age 16 years old and change in alcohol frequency from ages 16 to 20. The sample comprised 8,941 White adolescents (49% female) from Great Britain within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Results: Greater polygenic risk was associated with more frequent initial drinking as well as escalations in drinking frequency over the subsequent 5 years in latent growth curve models. Contrary to study hypotheses, no significant GxE effects were identified after controlling for confounding main and interaction effects. Conclusions: Adolescents at heightened genetic risk may accelerate their alcohol use across adolescence, although not significantly more so in the presence of these alcohol-promoting peer environments. Future well-powered, theoretically driven replication efforts are needed to examine generalizability of these findings across diverse samples.

A solution is to optimize the efforts of enforcement officers by prioritizing ways in which they regulate commercial alcohol availability. This could increase compliance by sellers, curbing commercial availability. The objective of this study is to present the development of a commercial alcohol availability estimate (CAAE) for all vendor types selling alcohol and to propose a priority ranking. Method: A multi-method design was used, combining data (collected in 2015) from national studies reporting behavior of minors purchasing alcohol themselves and the success rate (noncompliance) of alcohol vendors (interviewing 510 minors by telephone and conducting 1,373 purchase attempts of alcohol by minors, respectively). Descriptive data and the development of the CAAE are presented. Results: Compared with other vendor types (e.g., sports bars or supermarkets), bars/cafes/discos scored highest on the CAAE, indicating that 7.7% of 16- to 17-year-olds in the survey reported successfully purchasing their own alcohol at this vendor type. Conclusions: To control commercial alcohol availability efficiently for minors in the Netherlands, our estimates suggest that enforcement and prevention efforts should prioritize bars/cafes/discos. However, local authorities should also consider local circumstances and maintain a base amount of attention for all vendor types. Ultimately, the CAAE has the potential to improve enforcer capacity and efficiency in policing commercial alcohol regulation, and prevention workers could align their interventions or campaigns to high-ranked vendor types.

Color illusions also deceive CNNs for low-level vision tasks: Analysis and implications								VISION RESEARCH				176				156	174		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.010			NOV 2020	2020	The study of visual illusions has proven to be a very useful approach in vision science. In this work we start by showing that, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for low-level visual tasks in natural images may be deceived by brightness and color illusions, some network illusions can be inconsistent with the perception of humans. Next, we analyze where these similarities and differences may come from. On one hand, the proposed linear eigenanalysis explains the overall similarities: in simple CNNs trained for tasks like denoising or deblurring, the linear version of the network has center-surround receptive fields, and global transfer functions are very similar to the human achromatic and chromatic contrast sensitivity functions in human-like opponent color spaces. These similarities are consistent with the long-standing hypothesis that considers low-level visual illusions as a by-product of the optimization to natural environments. Specifically, here human-like features emerge from error minimization. On the other hand, the observed differences must be due to the behavior of the human visual system not explained by the linear approximation. However, our study also shows that more 'flexible' network architectures, with more layers and a higher degree of nonlinearity, may actually have a worse capability of reproducing visual illusions. This implies, in line with other works in the vision science literature, a word of caution on using CNNs to study human vision: on top of the intrinsic limitations of the L + NL formulation of artificial networks to model vision, the nonlinear behavior of flexible architectures may easily be markedly different from that of the visual system.

J	Levi, Dennis M.								Rethinking amblyopia 2020								VISION RESEARCH				176				118	129		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.014			NOV 2020	2020	Recent work has transformed our ideas about the neural mechanisms, behavioral consequences and effective therapies for amblyopia. Since the 1700's, the clinical treatment for amblyopia has consisted of patching or penalizing the strong eye, to force the "lazy" amblyopic eye, to work. This treatment has generally been limited to infants and young children during a sensitive period of development. Over the last 20 years we have learned much about the nature and neural mechanisms underlying the loss of spatial and binocular vision in amblyopia, and that a degree of neural plasticity persists well beyond the sensitive period. Importantly, the last decade has seen a resurgence of research into new approaches to the treatment of amblyopia both in children and adults, which emphasize that monocular therapies may not be the most effective for the fundamentally binocular disorder that is amblyopia. These approaches include perceptual learning, video game play and binocular methods aimed at reducing inhibition of the amblyopic eye by the strong fellow eye, and enhancing binocular fusion and stereopsis. This review focuses on the what we've learned over the past 20 years or so, and will highlight both the successes of these new treatment approaches in labs around the world, and their failures in clinical trials. Reconciling these results raises important new questions that may help to focus future directions.

The present research documents how the concept of time influences the preferences and behavioral intentions of older and younger adults in a consumer behavior context. Methods Study 1 had 99 young adults (under 25) and 82 seniors (over 65) rate persuasive advertisements varying in their temporal focus (past vs future vs control). Using a forced-choice paradigm, Study 2 had 98 young adults and 74 seniors choose between a product being advertised using a past versus future frame. Results Study 1 indicated that seniors responded more favorably to advertisements presented with a past-focus compared to future-focused and control ads, while younger adults rated the control ads higher than both the past- and future-focused ones. Study 2 reported that seniors opted for a past-focused product more frequently (68%) than a future-focused alternative (32%), with younger adults showing no pattern in their choices. Conclusions Seniors may respond more favorably to persuasive messages framed with a past temporal focus, in turn influencing their preferences and decision-making across several domains including consumer behavior, health promotion, and leadership.

Here, however, we report data from two experiments challenging this assumption. In the first experiment (N = 48), real-word deviants did not elicit more negative MMNs than pseudoword deviants; the acoustic difference between standard and deviant was identical across these comparisons. In this experiment, the pseudoword deviant [p(h)a] differed from a real-word [p(h)a(1)] in tone only; therefore, to test the possibility that the lexicality effect is real but is restricted to pseudowords that differ from real words by at least one segment, we ran a second experiment which included different items and participants, and also included a control comparison in which the pseudoword ([ts(h)ei]) differs from all real words by at least one segment (there is no existing Mandarin morpheme pronounced [tshei] in any tone). In the second experiment (N = 36), both types of pseudowords failed to elicit less negative MMNs than real words. These findings, together with other recent studies failing to show lexicality effects in MMN, challenge the assumption that wordhood reliably influences MMN amplitude.

However, the question of where the stimulation should be applied is still unresolved. In a preliminary survey for an effective and feasible solution to this problem, we identified three representative rTMS targets using cortico-hippocampal connectivity, calculated using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from 80 young, healthy subjects: (1) the cortical area with the strongest connectivity across the whole cerebral cortical area; (2) the whole lateral parietal cortical area; and (3) the whole medial prefrontal cortical area. We then compared the short-term effects on associative memory, which was tested using face-cued word recall by applying rTMS to three identified targets in a single population of eight healthy adults. Each treatment lasted for 2 days. Associative memory performance was measured at four time points: before and after stimulation on the first day (baseline and post 1) and before and after stimulation on the second day (post 2 and post 3). Compared with baseline levels, 20 min of high-frequency rTMS delivered to target 2 or target 3 produced a significant increase in the mean accuracy of associative memory performance at the post 3 time point alone (target 2, P = 0.0035; target 3, P = 0.0012). Compared with the sham conditions, significant increases in the mean associative memory performance were observed when high-frequency rTMS was delivered to target 2 (P = 0.02) and target 3 (P = 0.012), but not when delivered to target 1 (P = 0.1). Compared with baseline levels, 20 min of high-frequency rTMS delivered to target 3 produced a significant reduction in the mean reaction time of associative memory only at time points post 1 (P = 0.0464) and post 3 (P = 0.0477). Compared with the sham conditions, significant reductions in the mean reaction time of associative memory were observed when high-frequency rTMS was delivered to target 3 (P = 0.006), but not when delivered to target 1 (P = 0.471) or target 2 (P = 0.365). Our findings indicate that stimulation of the locations with the strongest cortico-hippocampal connectivity within the lateral parietal cortical or medial prefrontal cortical areas is effective in enhancing face-word recall-based associative memory in the short term.

The discrepancy between functional impairment and brain imaging findings in patients with MS (PwMS) might be attributed to differential adaptive and consolidation capacities. Modulating those abilities could contribute to a favorable clinical course of the disease. Objectives: We examined the effect of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) on locomotor adaptation and consolidation in PwMS using a split-belt treadmill (SBT) paradigm. Methods: 40 PwMS and 30 matched healthy controls performed a locomotor adaptation task on a SBT. First, we assessed locomotor adaptation in PwMS. In a second investigation, this training was followed by cerebellar anodal tDCS applied immediately after the task ipsilateral to the fast leg (T0). The SBT paradigm was repeated 24 h (T1) and 78 h (T2) post-stimulation to evaluate consolidation. Results: The gait dynamics and adaptation on the SBT were comparable between PwMS and controls. We found no effects of offline cerebellar anodal tDCS on locomotor adaptation and consolidation. Participants who received the active stimulation showed the same retention index than sham-stimulated subjects at T1 (p = 0.33) and T2 (p = 0.46). Conclusion: Locomotor adaptation is preserved in people with mild-to-moderate MS. However, cerebellar anodal tDCS applied immediately post-training does not further enhance this ability. Future studies should define the neurobiological substrates of maintained plasticity in PwMS and how these substrates can be manipulated to improve compensation. Systematic assessments of methodological variables for cerebellar tDCS are urgently needed to increase the consistency and replicability of the results across experiments in various settings.

More concretely, we investigated event-related desynchronization/synchronization patterns during sports MI (playing tennis) compared with simple MI (squeezing a ball) and discovered high variability across participants. Thirty healthy volunteers were divided in two groups; the experimental group (EG) performed a physical exercise between two imagery sessions, and the control group (CG) watched a landscape movie without physical activity. We computed inter-individual differences by assessing the dissimilarities among subjects for each group, condition, time period, and frequency band. In the alpha band, we observe some clustering in the ranking of the subjects, therefore showing smaller distances than others. Moreover, in our statistical evaluation, we observed a consistency in ranking across time periods both for the EG and for the CG. For the latter, we also observed similar rankings across conditions. On the contrary, in the beta band, the ranking of the subjects was more similar for the EG across conditions and time periods than for the subjects of the CG. With this study, we would like to draw attention to variability measures instead of primarily focusing on the identification of common patterns across participants, which often do not reflect the whole neurophysiological reality.

Different visual configurations of the widely studied P300-based BCI speller had been assessed with healthy and motor-disabled users. However, the speller size (in terms of cm) had only been assessed for healthy subjects. We think that the speller size might be limiting for some severely motor-disabled patients with restricted head and eye movements. The usability of three speller sizes was assessed for seven patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a participant diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This is the first usability evaluation of speller size with severely motor-disabled participants. Effectiveness (in the online results) and efficiency (in the workload test) of the medium speller was remarkably better. Satisfaction was significantly the highest with the medium size speller and the lowest with the small size. These results correlate with previously described findings in healthy subjects. In conclusion, the speller size should be considered when designing a speller paradigm, especially for motor-disabled individuals, since it might affect their performance and user experience while controlling a BCI speller.

Trait impulsivity may influence substance dependence by impacting its neurobiological underpinnings in the frontostriatal circuit. However, little is known about the trait impulsivity and its neural correlates in individuals with BQD. Methods: Forty-eight participants with BQD and 22 normal controls (NCs) were recruited and scanned on a 3T MRI scanner. Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS) was used to measure trait impulsivity: motor, attention, and no plan impulsivity. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess the relationship between trait impulsivity and gray matter volumes. The relevant clusters identified were served as regions of interest (ROI) seeds. The whole-volume psycho-physiological interactions (PPI) analysis was used to investigate the changes of functional connectivity related to ROI seeds in the cue-reactivity task condition (BQ and control images). Results: Behaviorally, the BQD group showed significantly higher trait impulsivity including motor and no plan impulsivity than the NCs group. VBM analyses showed that motor impulsivity was negatively associated with gray matter volume of right caudate in the whole sample. No difference in gray matter volume between the two groups was observed. PPI analyses showed that there was a significantly decreased functional connectivity between the right caudate and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when watching BQ related images than control images in individuals with BQD. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the right caudate and right DLPFC was negatively correlated with BQ dependency scores. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the structural basis of trait impulsivity in the caudate and provided evidence for abnormal interactions within frontostriatal circuitsin individuals with BQD, which may provide insight into the selection of potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of BQ dependency.

This repetition-attenuation has not previously been investigated in response to variable auditory stimuli, nor has the relative impact of acoustic vs. perceptual category repetition been studied. In the present study, N1 repetition-attenuation was investigated for speech and spectrally rotated speech with varying degrees of acoustic and perceptual category variation. In the speech condition, participants (n = 19) listened to stimulus trains consisting of either the same vowel exemplar (no variability condition), different exemplars of the same vowel (low variability condition), or different exemplars of two different vowels (high variability condition). In the rotated speech condition, the spectrally rotated counterparts of the vowels were presented. Findings show N1 repetition-attenuation in the face of acoustic and perceptual category variability, but no impact of the degree of variability on the degree of N1 attenuation. Speech stimuli resulted in less attenuation than the acoustically matched non-speech stimuli, which is in line with previous findings. It remains unclear if the attenuation of the N1 wave is reduced as a result of stimuli being perceived as belonging to perceptual categories or as a result of some other characteristic of speech.

J	Ramanoel, Stephen; Durteste, Marion; Becu, Marcia; Habas, Christophe; Arleo, Angelo								Differential Brain Activity in Regions Linked to Visuospatial Processing During Landmark-Based Navigation in Young and Healthy Older Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						552111	10.3389/fnhum.2020.552111			OCT 29 2020	2020	Older adults have difficulties in navigating unfamiliar environments and updating their wayfinding behavior when faced with blocked routes. This decline in navigational capabilities has traditionally been ascribed to memory impairments and dysexecutive function, whereas the impact of visual aging has often been overlooked. The ability to perceive visuospatial information such as salient landmarks is essential to navigating efficiently. To date, the functional and neurobiological factors underpinning landmark processing in aging remain insufficiently characterized. To address this issue, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the brain activity associated with landmark-based navigation in young and healthy older participants. The performances of 25 young adults (mu = 25.4 years, sigma = 2.7; seven females) and 17 older adults (mu = 73.0 years, sigma = 3.9; 10 females) were assessed in a virtual-navigation task in which they had to orient using salient landmarks. The underlying whole-brain patterns of activity as well as the functional roles of specific cerebral regions involved in landmark processing, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), were analyzed. Older adults' navigational abilities were overall diminished compared to young adults. Also, the two age groups relied on distinct navigational strategies to solve the task. Better performances during landmark-based navigation were associated with increased neural activity in an extended neural network comprising several cortical and cerebellar regions. Direct comparisons between age groups revealed that young participants had greater anterior temporal activity. Also, only young adults showed significant activity in occipital areas corresponding to the cortical projection of the central visual field during landmark-based navigation. The region-of-interest analysis revealed an increased OPA activation in older adult participants during the landmark condition. There were no significant between-group differences in PPA and RSC activations. These preliminary results hint at the possibility that aging diminishes fine-grained information processing in occipital and temporal regions, thus hindering the capacity to use landmarks adequately for navigation. Keeping sight of its exploratory nature, this work helps towards a better comprehension of the neural dynamics subtending landmark-based navigation and it provides new insights on the impact of age-related visuospatial processing differences on navigation capabilities.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						569614	10.3389/fnhum.2020.569614			OCT 29 2020	2020	We studied whether, due to deteriorating inhibitory functions, older people are more likely to process irrelevant stimuli; and if so, could they later use this information better than young adults. In the study phase of our experiment, a Posner-type gaze-cued version of a Simon task was performed in which we presented task-irrelevant cues, where faces or patches with either left- or right-looking dots for the pupil of the eye preceded the task to press a button congruent or incongruent with the presentation side of the target stimulus. In the follow-up test phase, participants completed an unexpected facial recognition test. In the study phase not only a decreased P1, but also an increased N170 amplitude of the event-related potentials (ERPs) were found in older, compared to younger adults, and also for faces compared to patches. Even though in the test phase both age-groups could recognize the faces better than statistically by chance, neither the older nor the younger participants could discriminate them effectively. The late positive component (LPC)-the ERP correlates of the old/new effect, being the higher amplitude for the earlier presented stimuli when compared with the unseen stimuli during the recognition test-was not evolved in the older group, while a reversed old/new effect was seen in younger participants: higher amplitude was found in New-Right and Old-Wrong conditions (for faces they did not recognize independent of seeing them before) compared to Old-Right and New-Wrong conditions (for faces they thought they recognized from the study phase). In conclusion, although older adults showed enhanced processing of task-irrelevant stimuli compared to younger adults, as indicated by the N170 amplitude, however, they were not able to utilize this information in a later task, as was suggested by the recognition rate and LPC amplitude results.

Eyetracking during picture naming predicts future vocabulary dropout in progressive anomia								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	4			560	578		10.1080/09602011.2020.1835676			APR 21 2022	2022	The dynamic and unpredictable nature of expressive vocabulary dropout in progressive anomia presents a challenge for language intervention. We evaluated whether eye gaze patterns during naming could predict anomia for the same items in the near future. We tracked naming accuracy and gaze patterns as patients with semantic (n = 7) or logopenic (n = 2) variants of Primary Progressive Aphasia or amnestic Alzheimer's Disease (n = 1), named photographs of people and objects. Patients were tested three or more times spaced roughly evenly over an average duration of 19.1 months. Target words named accurately at baseline were retrospectively coded as either known (i.e., consistently named) or vulnerable (i.e., inaccurately or inconsistently named) based on naming accuracy over the study interval. We extracted gaze data corresponding to successful naming attempts and implemented logistic mixed effects models to determine whether common gaze measures could predict each word's naming status as known or vulnerable. More visual fixations and greater visual fixation dispersion predicted later anomia. These findings suggest that eye tracking may yield a biomarker of the robustness of particular target words to future expressive vocabulary dropout.

An fMRI Investigation								EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH				47	1			1	20		10.1080/0361073X.2020.1839310			JAN 1 2021	2021	How prospective memory (PM) weakens with increasing age has been largely debated. We hypothesized that automatic and strategic PM processes, respectively mediated by focal and non-focal cues, are differently affected by aging, even starting from 50-60 years of age. We investigated this issue using a 2 x 2 design in which focal and non-focal experimental conditions were created by varying the conjoint nature of the ongoing task (lexical decision vs. syllable matching tasks) and the PM cue (words vs. syllables). In the whole-brain analysis we found that the left inferior frontal gyrus and the middle cingulate cortex were more activated when young compared to older individuals performed a PM task; moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex was selectively activated during non-focal PM when the cues were words. In a region-of-interest analysis we observed that the medial and the lateral portions of the rostral prefrontal cortex were associated with the focal and non-focal conditions respectively, more in young than in older adults. Our findings provide evidence in support of early age-related differences in automatic/strategic PM functioning.

Positive Economic, Psychosocial, and Physiological Ecologies Predict Brain Structure and Cognitive Performance in 9-10-Year-Old Children; Positive Economic								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE; FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						578822	10.3389/fnhum.2020.578822			OCT 28 2020	2020	While low socioeconomic status (SES) introduces risk for developmental outcomes among children, there are an array of proximal processes that determine the ecologies and thus the lived experiences of children. This study examined interrelations between 22 proximal measures in the economic, psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal ecologies of children, in association with brain structure and cognitive performance in a diverse sample of 8,158 9-10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. SES was measured by the income-to-needs ratio (INR), a measure used by federal poverty guidelines. Within the ABCD study, in what is one of the largest and most diverse cohorts of children studied in the United States, we replicate associations of low SES with lower total cortical surface area and worse cognitive performance. Associations between low SES (<200% INR) and measures of development showed the steepest increases with INR, with apparent increases still visible beyond the level of economic disadvantage in the range of 200-400% INR. Notably, we found three latent factors encompassing positive ecologies for children across the areas of economic, psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal well-being in association with better cognitive performance and the higher total cortical surface area beyond the effects of SES. Specifically, latent factors encompassing youth perceived social support and perinatal well-being were positive predictors of developmental measures for all children, regardless of SES. Further, we found a general latent factor that explained relationships between 20 of the proximal measures and encompassed a joint ecology of higher social and economic resources relative to low adversity across psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal domains. The association between the resource-to-adversity latent factor and cognitive performance was moderated by SES, such that for children in higher SES households, cognitive performance progressively increased with these latent factor scores, while for lower SES, cognitive performance increased only among children with the highest latent factor scores. Our findings suggest that both positive ecologies of increased access to resources and lower adversity are mutually critical for promoting better cognitive development in children from low SES households. Our findings inform future studies aiming to examine positive factors that influence healthier development in children.

N-Back Related ERPs Depend on Stimulus Type, Task Structure, Pre-processing, and Lab Factors								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						549966	10.3389/fnhum.2020.549966			OCT 28 2020	2020	The N-Back, a common working memory (WM) updating task, is increasingly used in basic and applied psychological research. As such, an increasing number of electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have sought to identify the electrophysiological signatures of N-Back task performance. However, stimulus type, task structure, pre-processing methods, and differences in the laboratory environment, including the EEG recording setup employed, greatly vary across studies, which in turn may introduce inconsistencies in the obtained results. Here we address this issue by conducting nine different variations of an N-Back task manipulating stimulus type and task structure. Furthermore, we explored the effect of the pre-processing method used and differences in the laboratory environment. Results reveal significant differences in behavioral and electrophysiological signatures in response to N-Back stimulus type, task structure, pre-processing method, and laboratory environment. In conclusion, we suggest that experimental factors, analysis pipeline, and laboratory differences, which are often ignored in the literature, need to be accounted for when interpreting findings and making comparisons across studies.

Herein we investigate whether the positivity effect is present in Korean older adults. Moreover, we examined individual indifferences alongside age differences in the positivity effect because not all older adults display the positivity effect. Method Forty older adults and 40 undergraduate students completed a series of self-report questionnaires and a dot probe task for 500 ms and 1000 ms. Next, we divided the subjects into groups who showed and did not show the positivity effect. Results In the dot probe task, older adults were more positive at the presentation duration of 500 ms and less negative at presentation times of 1000 ms, suggesting that the positivity effect is present in the attentional process. On the other hand, older adults who do show the positivity effect exhibit less negative affect, are less anxious, have fewer difficulties in emotion regulation, and achieve higher scores in a digit span task. Discussion These results suggest that the positivity effect emerges during more controlled stages of informational processing, and it is important to consider individual differences when investigating age-related differences in the positivity effect.

Studies have found that exposure to childhood abuse is associated with chronic pain in adulthood; however, few studies have examined this association in people with SUDs. Objectives: This study aimed to characterize the association between childhood abuse and chronic pain presence and severity in adults with SUDs. Methods: Data were obtained from 672 treatment-seeking participants with SUDs on an inpatient detoxification unit. Regression models evaluated whether childhood physical or sexual abuse was associated with the likelihood of chronic pain and severity of several pain-related characteristics: pain catastrophizing, pain severity, and pain interference. Results: Childhood physical and sexual abuse were significantly associated with a greater likelihood of chronic pain in adulthood. In the adjusted analyses, childhood physical abuse was associated with worse pain severity, whereas childhood sexual abuse was associated with greater pain catastrophizing and worse pain interference. Conclusions: Childhood physical and sexual abuse were associated with a greater likelihood of chronic pain in adults with SUDs. Among those with chronic pain, exposure to childhood abuse was associated with a more severe symptom profile, characterized by greater pain severity, more catastrophic interpretations of pain, and more pain-related interference with daily life. People with SUDs and a history of childhood abuse may benefit from screening for pain and interventions to reduce pain catastrophizing. These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal research to understand mechanisms linking childhood abuse exposure to later pain and substance misuse.		[Taghian, Nadine R.; McHugh, R.

Fourteen services were interviewed, including eight medical rehabilitation services, three community-based rehabilitation services, two insurance services, and one state-wide education service provider. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis in NVivo. Compared to the number of services supporting children and youth with traumatic brain injury, a very limited number supported those with spinal cord injury. Although valued and often included in the model of care, family-centred care was rarely systematically evaluated by the services. Most services provided psychosocial and transition support to children and youth, and their families in the short-term post-injury, but not in the long-term. Several challenges also hindered the smooth delivery of these support services, including poor communication between service providers. These findings show that services aimed to provide the best possible care to these children and youth, and their families; guided by rehabilitation models of care. However, challenges persist with regards to delivering family-centred care, coordinating return to school, and providing long-term support for psychosocial problems and transition.

They received personalized interdisciplinary rehabilitation. At discharge, IR was evaluated. The association between IR and demographic/clinical data was investigated using a logistic regression analysis, both in the Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and Minimal Consciousness State (MCS) group, divided according to their Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score at admission. In the UWS group (N = 107), only decannulation was associated with IR at discharge (OR: 5.94, CI: 2.08-16.91, p = .001). In the MCS group (N = 129) time post-injury (OR: 0.983, CI: 0.97-0.99, p = .012) and decannulation were associated with IR at discharge (OR: 17.9, CI: 6.39-50.13, p .001). Decannulation and IR were found to be strongly related, independently from the initial clinical state. While the retrospective nature of the study could not exclude that decannulation may be a consequence of a spontaneous recovery, the obtained results may disclose its potential influence on the clinical history of patients with DoC.

During face-to-face conversations, visemic information is used to predict upcoming auditory input. Recent studies suggest that the speech motor system plays a role in these cross-modal predictions, however, usually only audio-visual paradigms are employed. Here we tested whether speech sounds can be predicted on the basis of visemic information only, and to what extent interfering with orofacial articulatory effectors can affect these predictions. We registered EEG and employed N400 as an index of such predictions. Our results show that N400's amplitude was strongly modulated by visemic salience, coherent with cross-modal speech predictions. Additionally, N400 ceased to be evoked when syllables' visemes were presented backwards, suggesting that predictions occur only when the observed viseme matched an existing articuleme in the observer's speech motor system (i.e., the articulatory neural sequence required to produce a particular phoneme/viseme). Importantly, we found that interfering with the motor articulatory system strongly disrupted cross-modal predictions. We also observed a late P1000 that was evoked only for syllable-related visual stimuli, but whose amplitude was not modulated by interfering with the motor system. The present study provides further evidence of the importance of the speech production system for speech sounds predictions based on visemic information at the pre-lexical level. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of a hypothesized trimodal repertoire for speech, in which speech perception is conceived as a highly interactive process that involves not only your ears but also your eyes, lips and tongue.

Dependence and Use Characteristics of Adult JUUL Electronic Cigarette Users								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	1			61	66		10.1080/10826084.2020.1834582			JAN 2 2021	2021	Background: JUUL is a popular electronic cigarette (e-cig) that is capable of delivering nicotine similarly to a cigarette. While known to deliver high doses of nicotine, there is little systematic evidence to show how the nicotine delivery of JUUL translates to user dependence. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate self-reported dependence of JUUL users and examine the relationship of dependence to user behaviors. Methods: Current JUUL users were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete an online survey about their use of JUUL. Participants were asked to complete the Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index (PSECDI) and to answer questions about their use patterns and other tobacco use. Means and frequencies were used to describe the sample. A linear regression model was used to predict user dependence. Results: Participants (n = 76) were 65.4% male with a mean age of 31.9 (SD = 8.3) years. The mean PSECDI score was 7.8 (SD = 4.2) and ranged from no (15.8%) to high (14.5%) dependence. Overall predictors of a greater PSECDI score included reporting ever stealth vaping (beta = 2.8, p < .01) and reporting greater use days in the past 30 (beta = 3.5, p < .01). Conclusions: On average, JUUL users reported low to medium nicotine dependence on the PSECDI. JUUL user dependence may be more similar to e-cig user dependence than cigarette smoker dependence. These preliminary findings should be followed up in studies of larger samples of Juul users, collecting multiple measures of dependence, as well as biomarkers of nicotine intake (e.g. cotinine).

In this study, we conducted an attention bias modification task in conjunction with event-related potential measurements for individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP) and investigated the relationship between attention bias and psychological assessment. Methods: Eleven women and two men with chronic LBP participated in the study. Results: The Japanese version of the STarT Back Screening Tool (J-SBST) total score was significantly correlated with the N1 amplitude of Cz. The J-SBST psychological score was significantly correlated with the N1 amplitude of Cz and with reaction time (RT). The Japanese version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Japanese version of the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) scores were significantly correlated with the P2 amplitude at Fz (only PCS), Cz, and Pz. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that J-SBST, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of psychological factors, PCN with measuring of catastrophizing in the context of actual or anticipated pain, and BDI-II, can likely help identify chronic LBP patients with attention bias. For chronic LBP patients who are classified according to J-SBST or PCN pain-related outcome improvement with ABM training can be expected.

White Matter Neuroplasticity: Motor Learning Activates the Internal Capsule and Reduces Hemodynamic Response Variability								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						509258	10.3389/fnhum.2020.509258			OCT 26 2020	2020	Numerous studies have noted the importance of white matter changes in motor learning, but existing literature only focuses on structural and microstructural MRI changes, as there are limited tools available for in vivo investigations of white matter function. One method that has gained recent prominence is the application of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI to white matter, with high-field scanners now being able to better detect the smaller hemodynamic changes present in this tissue type compared to those in the gray matter. However, fMRI techniques have yet to be applied to investigations of neuroplastic change with motor learning in white matter. White matter function represents an unexplored component of neuroplasticity and is essential for gaining a complete understanding of learning-based changes occurring throughout the whole brain. Twelve healthy, right-handed participants completed fine motor and gross motor tasks with both hands, using an MRI compatible computer mouse. Using a crossover design along with a prior analysis approach to establish WM activation, participants received a baseline scan followed by 2 weeks of training, returning for a midpoint and endpoint scan. The motor tasks were designed to be selectively difficult for the left hand, leading to a training effect only in that condition. Analysis targeted the comparison and detection of training-associated right vs left hand changes. A statistically significant improvement in motor task score was only noted for the left-hand motor condition. A corresponding change in the temporal characteristics of the white matter hemodynamic response was shown within only the right corticospinal tract. The hemodynamic response exhibited a reduction in the dispersion characteristics after the training period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MRI detectable functional neuroplasticity in white matter, suggesting that modifications in temporal characteristics of white matter hemodynamics may underlie functional neuroplasticity in this tissue.

Objectives: This study tested components of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Readiness to Change, based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), to identify useful constructs for developing alcohol use interventions for youth. Methods: A sample of 825 Thai student drinkers (65% female), between the ages of 14 and 19, were recruited in Bangkok, Thailand. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test components of the TPB and Readiness to Change as predictors of intention to reduce/stop alcohol use while controlling for age, gender and alcohol use. Results: The model accounted for 58% of the variance of intentions. The TPB components accounted for a significant increase in variance beyond that explained by age, gender and alcohol use, Delta R (2) = .23, p < .001; Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) was the strongest predictor (beta =.41, p < .001), followed by Attitudes (beta=.13, p < .001), and Subjective Norms (beta =.09, p = .002). Readiness to Change composite scores (beta=.54, p < .001) were added last and accounted for a further significant increase, Delta R (2) = .24, p < .001. Conclusions: The findings suggest that interventions should assess Readiness to Change and utilize effective processes in facilitating change at each stage. Other suggestions are to improve participants' PBC and to further examine the role of specific social norms and attitudes regarding perceived benefits and disadvantages of alcohol use.

Feasibility and user-experience of virtual reality in neuropsychological assessment following stroke								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	4			499	519		10.1080/09602011.2020.1831935			APR 21 2022	2022	Virtual Reality (VR) offers the possibility to assess cognitive functioning in a dynamic environment resembling daily life. In this cross-sectional study, we used two user interfaces, namely non-immersive VR by using a computer monitor (CM) and immersive VR by using a head-mounted display (HMD). We investigated (1) potential differences in feasibility, user-experience, and a potential preference for one user interface over another between stroke patients and healthy controls; (2) potential differences in feasibility, user-experience, and preference between patients referred for inpatient rehabilitation care and patients referred for outpatient rehabilitation care; and (3) potential demographic and clinical characteristics that were related to patients' preference for one user interface over another. Stroke patients (n = 88) and healthy controls (n = 66) performed a VR-task with a CM and HMD. Both user interfaces were feasible to use, irrespective of clinical referral (in- or outpatient rehabilitation care). Patients reported an enhanced feeling of engagement, transportation, flow, and presence, but more negative side effects when tested with a HMD, compared to a CM. The majority of stroke patients had no preference for one user interface over the other, yet younger patients tended to prefer a HMD. VR seems highly feasible in stroke patients.

Case Report of Dual-Site Neurostimulation and Chronic Recording of Cortico-Striatal Circuitry in a Patient With Treatment Refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						569973	10.3389/fnhum.2020.569973			OCT 23 2020	2020	Psychiatric disorders are increasingly understood as dysfunctions of hyper- or hypoconnectivity in distributed brain circuits. A prototypical example is obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which has been repeatedly linked to hyper-connectivity of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesions of CSTC structures have shown promise for treating both OCD and related disorders involving over-expression of automatic/habitual behaviors. Physiologically, we propose that this CSTC hyper-connectivity may be reflected in high synchrony of neural firing between loop structures, which could be measured as coherent oscillations in the local field potential (LFP). Here we report the results from the pilot patient in an Early Feasibility study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03184454) in which we use the Medtronic Activa PC+ S device to simultaneously record and stimulate in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS). We hypothesized that frequency-mismatched stimulation should disrupt coherence and reduce compulsive symptoms. The patient reported subjective improvement in OCD symptoms and showed evidence of improved cognitive control with the addition of cortical stimulation, but these changes were not reflected in primary rating scales specific to OCD and depression, or during blinded cortical stimulation. This subjective improvement was correlated with increased SMA and VC/VS coherence in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands, signals which persisted after correcting for stimulation artifacts. We discuss the implications of this research, and propose future directions for research in network modulation in OCD and more broadly across psychiatric disorders.

Crossed Corticospinal Facilitation Between Arm and Trunk Muscles Correlates With Trunk Control After Spinal Cord Injury								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						583579	10.3389/fnhum.2020.583579			OCT 23 2020	2020	Objective: To investigate whether crossed corticospinal facilitation between arm and trunk muscles is preserved following spinal cord injury (SCI) and to elucidate these neural interactions for postural control during functional arm movements. Methods: Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 subjects with incomplete SCI motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the erector spinae (ES) muscle were examined when the contralateral arm was at rest or performed 20% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of biceps brachii (BB) or triceps brachii (TB). Trunk function was assessed with rapid shoulder flexion and forward-reaching tasks. Results: MEP amplitudes in ES were increased during elbow flexion in some subjects and this facilitatory effect was more prominent in subjects with thoracic SCI than in the subjects with cervical SCI. Those who showed the increased MEPs during elbow flexion had faster reaction times and quicker anticipatory postural adjustments of the trunk in the rapid shoulder flexion task. The onset of EMG activity in ES during the rapid shoulder flexion task correlated with the trunk excursion in forward-reaching. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that crossed corticospinal facilitation in the trunk muscles can be preserved after SCI and is reflected in trunk control during functional arm movements.

Differences in metamemory monitoring accuracy in predementia conditions, which could inform treatment effectiveness, have not been systematically investigated. We utilized a retrospective confidence judgment (RCJ) task for general knowledge recognition in community-dwelling older adults: 106 cognitively healthy (HC), 68 subjective cognitive decline (SCD) despite intact neuropsychological function, 14 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 31 non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI). Participants gave confidence ratings after making recognition responses to general knowledge questions. Recognition accuracy, confidence levels, and absolute and relative RCJ accuracy (i.e., metamemory monitoring accuracy) were analysed. Compared to HC and SCD, absolute RCJ accuracy was significantly poorer in both MCI groups but relative RCJ accuracy was significantly poorer in naMCI, but not aMCI. This novel result may be driven by lower confidence for correct recognition responses in naMCI and suggests that poorer RCJ accuracy in naMCI may be attributable to poorer performance monitoring. We discuss results in relation to the possibility that individuals in distinct preclinical dementia conditions, who have different levels of memory/cognitive awareness, may differentially benefit from cognitive remediation strategies tailored to their levels of memory/cognitive awareness.

Randomized DBS studies have reported marked benefit in tremor with both GPi and STN and DBS, however, there is a paucity of information available on AT vs RT when separated by the surgical target. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the 1-year clinical outcome of PD patients treated with STN and GPi DBS at the University of Florida. We specifically selected patients with moderate to severe AT. Eighty-eight patients (57 STN and 31 GPi) were evaluated at 6 and 12 months for changes in AT and RT in the OFF-medication/ON stimulation state. A comparison of "response" was performed and defined as greater than or equal to a 2-point decrease in tremor score. Results: STN and GPi DBS both improved AT at 6-and 12-months post-implantation (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The STN DBS group experienced a greater improvement in AT at 6 months compared to the GPi group (p = 0.005) but not at the 12 months follow-up (p = 0.301). Both STN and GPi DBS also improved RT at 6-and 12-months post-implantation (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). There was no difference in RT scores between the two groups at 6 months (p = 0.23) or 12 months (p = 0.74). The STN group had a larger proportion of patients who achieved a "response" in AT at 6 months (p < 0.01), however, this finding was not present at 12 months (p = 0.23). A subanalysis revealed that in RT, the STN group had a larger percentage of "responders" when followed through 12 months (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Both STN and GPi DBS reduced PD associated AT and RT at 12 months follow-up. There was no advantage of either brain target in the management of RT or AT. One nuance of the study was that STN DBS was more effective in suppressing AT in the early postoperative period, however, this effect diminished over time. Clinicians should be aware that it may take longer to achieve a similar tremor outcome when utilizing the GPi target.

However, the specific relationship between mindfulness and impulsivity has been little explored in the literature, especially in people with AUD. This study aims to investigate the relationship between different facets of dispositional mindfulness and impulsivity among people with AUD in an inpatient setting in Brazil. Methods: Participants (n = 165) completed the following self-report measures: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-SF), and the Short UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (SUPPS-P). Multiple imputation techniques and linear models were employed to assess the relationships between dispositional mindfulness and impulsivity. Results: In complete case analysis, the UPPS-P facet "lack of premeditation" was inversely related to the FFMQ facet "non-reactivity" (B = -0.17; p = 0.01); and "positive urgency" was inversely related to "act with awareness" (B = -0.27, p = 0.02) and "non-reactivity" (B = -0.17, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Relationships of varying magnitudes between dispositional mindfulness and impulsivity domains among people with AUD were found, suggesting that higher mindfulness skills are related to less impulsive traits. Our results encourage further longitudinal studies evaluating the potential of specific mindfulness components to decrease impulsivity among AUD inpatients, including its underlying mechanisms.

Widely accepted criteria for diagnosing Substance Use Disorder (SUD) suggest parallels between narcissistic traits (e.g. invulnerability to consequences and lack of empathy for others) and the characteristics of drug abusers. Because narcissism as a concept has a long and somewhat confusing history, we first reviewed its origins in the psychoanalytic tradition of psychiatry and its exegesis into current clinical concepts in order to arrive at a set of attributes that may be useful when applied to problems of drug abuse. This process required extensive review of the literature on narcissism and its interactions with the literature on drug abuse. This process led to an understanding that positive self-concept may exemplify a variety of socially beneficial narcissism, but that at the other end of narcissism's continuum of traits may be found exploitative and non-empathetic traits. Furthermore, the negative traits of narcissism, as they may arise in adolescence along with drug use, can support an individual's ongoing dependence on drugs, especially if narcissism and drug use persist into adulthood. Our investigation of narcissism and drug use revealed, through in-depth interviewing, that some drug users employ drugs and alcohol to feed their self-concepts of superiority over other people. Our findings suggest that treatment for drug abuse cannot proceed assuming that drug users have low self-concepts. Rather, their continued use of drugs may emanate from a narcissistic sense of superiority.

Objectives: The aim was to characterize MDMA use in a sample of French medical students. Methods: Cross-sectional study of Paris VII medical students (N = 592) with an online self-reporting questionnaire. Results: 592 students completed the online questionnaire. 21.5% (n = 127) had experimented with MDMA. Use of MDMA was associated with male sex (p < 0.001), older age (p < 0.001), left the parent's home (p < 0.01), and belonging to a fraternity (p < 0.05). Most experimenters (90.7%) used MDMA in a club or during a music festival. Among users, 42.5% used it more than once a year and less than once a month. During the use, users drank alcohol (90.6%), smoked tobacco (70.9%), smoked cannabis (42.0%) or used cocaine (20.5%). In the days after the use, some smoked tobacco (40.9%), smoked cannabis (29.1%), drank alcohol (22.0%), used cocaine (1.6%) and also took benzodiazepines (5.5%). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, criteria, the prevalence of MDMA use disorder was 8.5% in our sample and 40.9% among MDMA users. As compared with students who never experienced MDMA, fewer users thought that occasional intake could be dangerous (66.9% vs 83.9%, p < 0.001) and that MDMA could be addictive (74.0% vs 90.3%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Other studies focusing on drug consumption among students are necessary to define specific public health strategies of prevention and harmful reduction.

Purpose/Objectives: To examine gender differences in triggers of methamphetamine use Methods: We provided a questionnaire survey to 699 inmates who were incarcerated because of violation of the Stimulants Control Act. Results: The results of DAST-20 (the severity of drug dependence) moderately correlated with the applicable numbers of the 37 situational triggers and 34 emotional triggers for stimulant use, respectively. Regarding gender differences, items including "when having sex" [46.3% (men) vs. 25.3% (women)], "when I have some money" (39.4% vs. 25.3%), and "after getting paid from work" (22.1% vs. 11.4%) were applicable in a significantly higher proportion in males (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively), whereas items including "worried about the body shape" (3.5% vs. 31.2%) and "after quarreling with someone" (11.7% vs. 29.1%) were applicable in a significantly higher proportion in females (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Further, most trigger (emotions) items that exhibited gender differences were significantly higher in females. Many females answered that they had used drugs to relieve discomfort symptoms associated with menstrual periods. Conclusions/Importance: Thus, the awareness of important factors including learning how to deal with negative emotions (e.g. depression), repairing self-image, and recognizing physical and emotional changes associated with the menstrual cycle is helpful in providing proper care and treatment of drug addiction in females.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						585086	10.3389/fnhum.2020.585086			OCT 22 2020	2020	Impaired decision-making is well documented in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and a range of electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging measures have begun to reveal the pathological mechanisms that underlie the decision-making process. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) has core symptoms that often overlap with OCD, but similarities between these disorders at the behavioral and neurological levels are often unclear, including whether OCPD exhibits similar decision-making deficits and shared neurological dysfunction. To address these issues, we examined 24 cases of OCD, 19 cases of OCPD, and 26 matched normal control (NC) subjects during the revised Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) using event-related potentials (ERPs). The net IGT scores were lower for OCD subjects than for OCPD or NC subjects, thus indicating that OCD subjects chose more disadvantageous options and were "short-sighted" with regards to information. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) waveform (lose-win) was larger in both OCD and OCPD subjects, which suggested that obstacles exist in the feedback process. Consequently, these subjects might share similar neural mechanisms under ambiguous decision-making circumstances. Furthermore, IGT net scores were significantly and negatively correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scales. This implies that more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms inspired more negative emotions that led to worse decision-making ability. Therefore, although similar neural mechanisms might exist, this led to different behaviors in which OCPD is associated with better behavioral performance compared to OCD patients.

J	Nobukawa, Sou; Yamanishi, Teruya; Ueno, Kanji; Mizukami, Kimiko; Nishimura, Haruhiko; Takahashi, Tetsuya								High Phase Synchronization in Alpha Band Activity in Older Subjects With High Creativity								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						583049	10.3389/fnhum.2020.583049			OCT 22 2020	2020	Despite growing evidence that high creativity leads to mental well-being in older individuals, the neurophysiological bases of creativity remain elusive. Creativity reportedly involves multiple brain areas and their functional interconnections. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to investigate the role of patterns of functional connectivity between the default network and other networks in creative activity. These interactions among networks play the role of integrating various neural processes to support creative activity and involve attention, cognitive control, and memory. The electroencephalogram (EEG) enables researchers to capture a pattern of band-specific functional connectivity, as well as moment-to-moment dynamics of brain activity; this can be accomplished even in the resting-state by exploiting the excellent temporal resolution of the EEG. Furthermore, the recent advent of functional connectivity analysis in EEG studies has focused on the phase-difference variable because of its fine spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combining method of EEG signals having high-temporal resolution and the phase synchronization analysis having high-spatio-temporal resolutions brings a new insight of functional connectivity regarding high creative activity of older participants. In this study, we examined the resting-state EEG signal in 20 healthy older participants and estimated functional connectivities using the phase lag index (PLI), which evaluates the phase synchronization of EEG signals. Individual creativity was assessed using the S-A creativity test in a separate session before the EEG recording. In the analysis of associations of EEG measures with the S-A test scores, the covariate effect of the intelligence quotient was evaluated. As a result, higher individual S-A scores were significantly associated with higher node degrees, defined as the average PLI of a node (electrode) across all links with the remaining nodes, across all nodes at the alpha band. A conventional power spectrum analysis revealed no significant association with S-A scores in any frequency band. Older participants with high creativity exhibited high functional connectivity even in the resting-state, irrespective of intelligence quotient, which supports the theory that creativity entails widespread brain connectivity. Thus, PLIs derived from EEG data may provide new insights into the relationship between functional connectivity and creativity in healthy older people.

This study investigated the relationship between Visual Matching and reading and their shared neuroanatomical basis. Two hundred and ninety-three typically developing Mandarin-speaking children were followed in a longitudinal study from ages 4 to 11 years old. A subsample of 79 children was further followed up at 14 years old when the MRI data were collected. Results showed that the development of Visual Matching from ages 6 to 8 predicted reading accuracy at age 11. In addition, both the development of Visual Matching and reading accuracy were associated with cortical surface area of a cluster located in fusiform gyrus. These findings suggested that the mapping from visual codes to phonological codes is important in learning to read and that left fusiform gyrus provided neural basis for such mapping. Implications of these findings in light of a new approach toward the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying reading development are discussed.

Previous research suggests that people upregulate the relationship value of a specific friend in response to the friend's commitment signals. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study (Study 1), participants imagined receiving high-cost commitment signals, low-cost commitment signals, or no signals from a particular friend. Participants' subjective rating of the relationship value upregulation was positively correlated with medial OFC activity. Subtraction analyses showed that high-cost commitment signals engaged the medial OFC more than did signal failures. An auxiliary analysis revealed that medial OFC activity in response to low-cost commitment signals was negatively correlated with loneliness. To follow-up these findings, we conducted an online vignette study (Study 2), in which participants rated the relationship value of a real friend before and after imagining receiving a series of low-cost commitment signals from that friend. Corroborating the upregulation hypothesis, perceived relationship value significantly increased after imagining a series of commitment signals. This effect was weaker among individuals high in loneliness.

Can behaviour support interventions successfully treat inappropriate sexual behaviour after acquired brain injury in community settings? A case series (N =24)								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	3			407	428		10.1080/09602011.2020.1830807			MAR 16 2022	2022	Inappropriate sexual behaviours (ISX) are challenging clinical sequelae of acquired brain injury (ABI). Limited evidence exists about treatment approaches, with few case studies published to date. This study reports an exploratory clinical trial of community-based behaviour support interventions as a treatment approach to ISX after ABI. From routine referrals to a state-wide service specializing in challenging behaviours after ABI, a cohort (n = 24) displaying ISXs were selected. The interventions addressed multiple behavioural domains, and used a variety of approaches including environmental change, psychoeducation, and specific behavioural techniques. These approaches targetted change in the person with ABI, support personnel, or other environmental domains. Behaviour data were collected using the Overt Behaviour Scale (OBS) at baseline, closure and follow-up. Visual inspection and multilevel models were used to analyse the data. For the sample as a whole, there was a significant decline in ISXs from baseline to closure that was maintained at follow-up. Results at an individual level are also presented. Specificity of the intervention was demonstrated by comparison with concurrent challenging behaviours (aggression, perseveration, absconding) which showed no significant change over the same three time points. The results demonstrate the potential efficacy of community-based behaviour support interventions in treating ISXs after ABI.

In total, 96 patients with DOC (vegetative state, minimally conscious state, or emergence from minimally conscious state) were enrolled (69 males; mean age 43.6 +/- 20.8 years) and the improvement of the degree of disability, as assessed by the Disability Rating Scale, was considered the main outcome measure. To define the best predictor, a series of demographical and clinical factors were modeled using a twofold approach: (1) logistic regression to evaluate a possible causal effect among variables; and (2) machine learning algorithms (ML), to define the best predictive model. Univariate analysis demonstrated that disability in DOC patients statistically decreased at the discharge with respect to admission. Genitourinary was the most frequent medical complication (MC) emerging during the neurorehabilitation period. The logistic model revealed that the total amount of MCs is a risk factor for lack of functional improvement. ML discloses that the most important prognostic factors are the respiratory and hepatic complications together with the presence of the upper gastrointestinal comorbidities. Our study provides new evidence on the most adverse short-term factors predicting a functional recovery in DOC patients after severe TBI. The occurrence of medical complications during neurorehabilitation stay should be considered to avoid poor outcomes.

This study investigates whether a simultaneous motor reaction of the other hand advances the associative plasticity in M1. Methods: Twenty-four right-handed subjects received conventional paired associative stimulation (PAS) and PAS with simultaneous motor reaction (PASmr) with at least a 1-week interval. The PASmr protocol additionally included left abductor pollicis brevis muscle movement responding to a digital sound. The motor reaction time was individually measured. The M1 excitability was examined by the motor evoked potential (MEP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) before and after the PAS protocols. Results: The conventional PAS protocol significantly facilitated MEP and suppressed SICI. A negative correlation between the reaction time and the MEP change, and a positive correlation between the reaction time and the ICF change were found in the PASmr protocol. By subgrouping analysis, we further found significant facilitation of MEP and a reduction of ICF in the subjects with fast reaction times but not in those with slow reaction times. Conclusion: Synchronized motor reaction ipsilateral to the stimulated M1 induces associative M1 motor plasticity through the spike-timing dependent principle. MEP and ICF change could represent this kind of plasticity. The current findings provide a novel insight into designing rehabilitation programs concerning motor function.

Much of the focus of interventions is upon narcotics, stimulants, hallucinogens, central nervous system depressants, and alcohol. However, inhalants are also commonly used in an unhealthy manner and are under-recognized. The purpose of this study is to describe incident emergency department visits for volatile substance use to induce euphoria (VSUIE) injuries in the U.S. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) for the years 2015 to 2018. Descriptive frequencies, bivariate analyses using Rao-Scott Chi-Square, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to describe and examine the association between ED visits and VSUIE. Results: The estimated (weighted) number of VSUIE ED visits during 2015-2018 was 13,130 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 8,383-17876; Coefficient of variation, CV = 0.18) and accounted for 0.02% of all ED visits. Males were more likely than females (p < .0001), and young adults (ages >= 18 to <= 35 years) were more likely than older adults to have a VSUIE ED visit (p <.0001). Conclusion: VSUIE ED visits occur more commonly in young adults than older adults and adolescents. The widespread use of volatile substances to induce euphoria is an under-reported public health issue with life-threatening consequences. Use of volatile substances by adolescents is a particular concern which needs attention and interventions to prevent its initiation.		[Wiener, R.

This study examined whether self-reported disengagement from previous goals and reengagement towards new, more feasible goals, are associated with higher quality of life (QOL) and life satisfaction. We also examined whether acceptance mediated these relationships. Methods: Eighty-two individuals (18-68 years of age) with an ABI completed a battery of questionnaires. We investigated the relations between goal disengagement and reengagement on the one hand, and general QOL, disease-specific QOL, life satisfaction and acceptance, on the other hand. Rehabilitation psychologists provided estimates of self-awareness and the extent of motor, communicative and cognitive impairment. Results: Goal reengagement, but not goal disengagement, was positively associated with mental QOL and life satisfaction, after statistically controlling for demographic and impairments. Acceptance mediated the relationship between goal reengagement on the one hand, and mental QOL and life satisfaction, on the other hand. Conclusion: After an ABI, reengagement in feasible goals is more important in explaining mental well-being and life satisfaction than disengagement from unattainable goals. Interventions aimed at identifying and pursuing new, feasible goals may be more helpful than strategies focusing on the loss of blocked goals.

Participants were 445 SMVs divided into four groups: 158 uncomplicated mild TBI ("unMTBI" group), 105 penetrating, severe, moderate, or complicated mild TBI ("smcTBI" group), 101 injured controls (IC), and 81 non-injured controls (NIC). Two independent cohorts were examined that included participants 5-years or 10-year post-injury. Participants completed the TBI-Quality of Life, Neurobehavioural Symptom Inventory, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. At 5-years and 10-years post-injury, there were significant main effects for the majority of measures (all p's < .005). At 10-years post-injury, the NIC group had consistently better scores compared to the IC, unMTBI, and smcTBI groups. At 5-years post-injury, either (a) the IC and NIC group had better scores compared to both TBI groups, or (b) the NIC group had better scores compared to the IC, unMTBI, and smcTBI groups. A high proportion of SMVs reported poor long-term neurobehavioural symptoms following TBI or bodily injury without TBI. Injured SMVs (regardless of injury type) can have long-term symptoms that impact mental health and overall quality of life requiring long-term follow-up and care.

The clinical picture may shed light on both the pathological characteristics of reaching and grasping actions, and potential rehabilitation strategies for optic ataxia. First, M.B. demonstrated a dissociation between severely impaired reaching and relatively spared grasping and tool use skills and knowledge, which confirms that grasping may be more intermingled with non-motoric cognitive mechanisms than reaching. Besides, M.B.'s reaching performance was sensitive to movement repetition. We observed a substitution effect: Reaching time decreased if M.B. repeatedly reached toward the same object but increased when object identity changed. This may imply that not only object localization but also object identity, is integrated into movement programming in reach-to-grasp tasks. Second, studying M.B.'s spontaneous compensation strategies ascertained that the mere repetition of reaching movements had a positive effect, to the point M.B. almost recovered to normal level after an intensive one-day repetitive training session. This case study seems to provide one of the first examples of optic ataxia rehabilitation. Reaching skills can be trained by repetitive training even two years post-stroke and despite the presence of visuo-imitative apraxia.

Objectives: In this article we examine engagement in HIV and HCV risk-related smoking practices, and experiences accessing safer inhalation supplies with the objective of identifying potential intervention points and associated harm reduction interventions to initiate and support safer inhalation practices. Methods: The study comprised four sequential components - formation and facilitation of a Youth Project team, qualitative interviews, and member checking workshops - each component building on the preceding and all contributing to the final and fourth component of the interviewer-administered quantitative survey from which data for this article are drawn. Eligibility criteria: capable of informed consent; aged between 16 and 25 years; had ever injected drugs or had ever tried crack or had used two or more hard drugs in the three months preceding their interview. Recruitment cards distributed by community agencies, honoraria and debriefing offered. Separate consent obtained for collection of finger prick blood samples for HIV and HCV laboratory testing. Results: 125 young people completed personal interviews in November 2013. This article is restricted to those 97 participants who had smoked crack. High rates of engagement in documented HIV- and HCV-related crack smoking practices were reported including nonuse of mouthpieces, use of non-recommended smoking devices and frequent engagement in equipment sharing; engagement compounded by the heightened confirmed prevalence of HCV. Conclusion: The youth in our study explained the utility of crack in their lives. Given the mental health drivers of engagement, ease of accessibility and availability, engagement in smoking crack is clearly likely to continue, firmly indicating the urgent necessity to ensure its safer use through gender neutral, youth-specific enhanced programming and resource distribution.

TIGER is the first study to examine the effects of peripheral inflammation on neurodevelopmental trajectories by assessing changes in cortical glutamate in depressed adolescents. Here, we describe the scientific rationale, design, and methods for the TIGER project. This article is intended to serve as an introduction to this project and to provide details for investigators who may be seeking to replicate or extend these methods for other related research endeavors.

J	Schaper, Selina Johanna; Hofmann, Tobias; Woelk, Ellen; Weibert, Elena; Rose, Matthias; Stengel, Andreas								Pancreatic Polypeptide but Not Other Members of the Neuropeptide Y Family Shows a Moderate Association With Perceived Anxiety in Obese Men								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						578578	10.3389/fnhum.2020.578578			OCT 19 2020	2020	Neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are important mediators in the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain-axis. Best known for their role in the regulation of appetite and food intake they are considered to play a crucial role in the development of obesity. Additionally, mounting evidence indicates a regulatory function in anxiety, mood and stress resilience with potential sex differences. In the present study, we examined the associations of NPY, PYY, and PP plasma levels with anxiety, depressiveness and perceived stress in obese patients. We analyzed 144 inpatients (90 female, 54 male, BMI mean: 49.4 kg/m(2)) in a naturalistic treatment setting for obesity and its somatic and mental comorbidities. Fasting blood samples were taken, and patients completed psychometric self-assessment questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQ-20) within the first week after admission and before discharge. Plasma concentrations of the peptides were measured by ELISA. Women showed significant higher anxiety (GAD-7: 8.13 +/- 5.67 vs. 5.93 +/- 5.42, p = 0.04) and stress scores (PSQ-20: 52.62 +/- 23.5 vs. 41.23 +/- 22.53, p = 0.01) than men. In the longitudinal analysis women with a clinically relevant improvement of anxiety (>= 5 points on GAD-7, p < 0.001) also showed significant improvements in depression (PHQ-9: 38%, p = 0.002) and PSQ-20 scores (23%, p = 0.005) while anxiety-improved male patients only improved in the subscale tension of the PSQ-20 (34%, p = 0.02). In men we observed a positive correlation of PP with anxiety scores (GAD-7: r = 0.41, p = 0.007) and with age (r = 0.49, p = 0.001) on admission while NPY negatively correlated with age (r = -0.38, p = 0.01). In contrast, there were no significant associations (p > 0.05) in female subjects in the cross-sectional as well as in the longitudinal analysis. In conclusion, women suffering from morbid obesity showed greater psychological comorbidity and considerable interactions among them. Despite that we solely observed associations of PP with anxiety and age with NPY and PP in men, suggesting a possible influence of sex hormones on the NPY system. However, improvement of anxiety scores did not lead to significant changes in NPY.

Hierarchical linear regression assessed whether egocentric network variables uniquely predicted personal alcohol use, controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and Greek-life affiliation.Results: Students with higher AUDIT scores were more likely to nominate persons close to them that engaged in more frequent, higher quantity drinking, and were also likely to mirror drinking behaviors to that of their close ties.Conclusion: Future studies should utilize SNA to capture the nuance associated with individuals' perceptions of close others' alcohol use and their own drinking behaviors. Interventions aimed at reducing collegiate drinking should consider the interpersonal nature of drinking behaviors among college student networks.

Unknown, however, is how polyvictimization-experiencing multiple types of violent victimization-affects substance use among SMCW.Purpose/Objectives:This study explores the relationship between polyvictimization and substance use among a small sample of SMCW.Methods:An exploratory secondary data analysis was conducted on data from a convenience sample of 115 SMCW currently in relationships (70.4% lesbian, 73.9% non-Hispanic white)viaa cross-sectional survey. Lifetime physical, sexual, and crime-related violent victimization were measured via the Trauma History Questionnaire. Past-year substance use was measuredviathe Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10). Mann-Whitney U testing and linear regression modeling were used to examine differences in substance use by victimization status (victimized/non-victimized) and the association between polyvictimization and substance use.Results:Lifetime prevalence of violent victimization was high with 60.9% of the sample reporting at least one type of victimization: 10.4% experienced physical, 22.6% experienced sexual, and 22.6% experienced crime-related violent victimization. Substance use was significantly greater for victimized participants than non-victimized participants. Modeling showed that as violent victimization increased by one unit, substance use scores increased by .30 units.Conclusion/Importance:Preliminary evidence suggests that increase in violent victimization was associated with increased substance use among SMCW. Findings indicate a need for additional confirmatory research with more representative samples and longitudinal data. Behavioral health practitioners are urged to consider the implications of these findings and assess for past cumulative violence and current risk of substance use disorder, to appropriately facilitate treatment planning.

Regulatory Focus and Substance Use in Adolescents: Protective Effects of Prevention Orientation								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				56	1			33	38		10.1080/10826084.2020.1833926			JAN 2 2021	2021	Background Substance use is a major risk factor for negative health and functioning outcomes among middle schoolers. The purpose of this study was to assess whether individual differences in the adolescents' goal orientation are associated with elevated or attenuated risk for substance use. Regulatory focus theory stipulates that individuals vary in their strength of orientation toward promotion goals ("making good things happen") and prevention goals ("keeping bad things from happening"). Objectives: We sought to examine the association between individual differences in regulatory focus and adolescents' reports of their own and their friends' substance use. Methods: Participants were 241 seventh grade students who completed measures of regulatory focus (promotion and prevention orientation), self-reported substance use, perceived substance use habits of peers, and demographics. Logistic regression models were used to examine adjusted odds of lifetime tobacco use, alcohol use, and marijuana use for both participants' own use and their reports of friends' use. Results: Prevention orientation was associated with lower odds of all self-reported lifetime substance use outcomes (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana). Prevention orientation was also associated with lower odds of reporting all types of substance use among friends. Promotion orientation was not associated with any self-reported substance use outcome, and was only associated with higher odds of reporting lifetime alcohol use among friends. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of regulatory focus as it relates to adolescent substance use. Future research may seek to incorporate regulatory focus within interventions intended to prevent or delay initiation of substance use in adolescents.

Recent work has also shown that odour is a powerful cue to alleviate decline in autobiographical memory in AD. Based on these findings, we investigated whether odour exposure improves access to self-concept in AD patients. To this end, we invited AD and control participants to make self-related statements (i.e., statements in response to the question "Who am I?") after odour exposure or without odour exposure. We measured the number and the categories of self-related statements (i.e., whether these statements described the psychological, social or physical self) that were generated in each condition. Results demonstrated that both AD and control participants generated more self-statements in the odour condition than in the odor-free condition, especially psychological self-statements. This study is the first to demonstrate the positive influence of olfactory stimulation on the retrieval of self-related knowledge in AD.

Recent research has clarified the contribution of different brain networks (default mode network, DN; executive control network; salience network) to creative thinking. However, the effects of brain stimulation on brain networks during creative thinking and on creative performance have not been clarified. The present study was designed to examine the changes in functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity (EC) of the large-scale brain network, and the ensuing changes in creative performance, induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Fourteen healthy male students underwent two tDCS sessions, one with actual stimulation and one with sham stimulation, on two separate days. Participants underwent tDCS (anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; cathode over the right inferior parietal lobule, IPL) for 20 min. Before and after the tDCS session, electroencephalography signals were acquired from 32 electrodes over the whole head during the creative thinking task. On FC analysis, the delta band FC between the posterior cingulate cortex and IPL significantly increased only after real stimulation. We also found that the change of flexibility score was significantly correlated with the change in: (i) delta band FC between mPFC and left lateral temporal cortex (LTC) and (ii) alpha band FC between IPL and right LTC. On EC analysis, decreased flow within the DN (from left LTC to right IPL) was observed. Our results reveal that tDCS could affect brain networks, particularly the DN, during creative thinking and modulate key FC in the generation of flexible creative ideas.

J	Hill, Nayo M.; Dewald, Julius P. A.								The Upper Extremity Flexion Synergy Is Minimally Expressed in Young Individuals With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy Following an Early Brain Injury								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						590198	10.3389/fnhum.2020.590198			OCT 16 2020	2020	Hemiparetic stroke in adulthood often results in the grouped movement pattern of the upper extremity flexion synergy thought to arise from an increased reliance on cortico-reticulospinal pathways due to a loss of lateral corticospinal projections. It is well established that the flexion synergy induces reaching constraints in individuals with adult-onset hemiplegia. The expression of the flexion synergy in individuals with brain injuries onset earlier in the lifespan is currently unknown. An early unilateral brain injury occurring prior to six months post full-term may preserve corticospinal projections which can be used for independent joint control and thus minimizing the expression of the flexion synergy. This study uses kinematics of a ballistic reaching task to evaluate the expression of the flexion synergy in individuals with pediatric hemiplegia (PH) ages six to seventeen years. Fifteen individuals with brain injuries before birth (n = 8) and around full-term (n = 7) and nine age-matched controls with no known neurological impairment completed a set of reaches in an admittance controlled robotic device. Descending drive, and the possible expression of the upper extremity flexion synergy, was modulated by increasing shoulder abduction loading. Individuals with early-onset PH achieved lower peak velocities when reaching with the paretic arm compared to controls; however, no differences in reaching distance were found between groups. Relative maintenance in reaching seen in individuals with early brain injuries highlights minimal expression of the flexion synergy. We interpret this conservation of independent control of the paretic shoulder and elbow as the use of more direct corticospinal projections instead of indirect cortico-reticulospinal pathways used in individuals with adult-onset hemiplegia.

J	Beaulieu, Christian; Yip, Eugene; Low, Pauline B.; Madler, Burkhard; Lebel, Catherine A.; Siegel, Linda; Mackay, Alex L.; Laule, Cornelia								Myelin Water Imaging Demonstrates Lower Brain Myelination in Children and Adolescents With Poor Reading Ability								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						568395	10.3389/fnhum.2020.568395			OCT 16 2020	2020	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a means to non-invasively investigate the neurological links with dyslexia, a learning disability that affects one's ability to read. Most previous brain MRI studies of dyslexia and reading skill have used structural or diffusion imaging to reveal regional brain abnormalities. However, volumetric and diffusion MRI lack specificity in their interpretation at the microstructural level. Myelin is a critical neural component for brain function and plasticity, and as such, deficits in myelin may impact reading ability. MRI can estimate myelin using myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, which is based on evaluation of the proportion of short T2 myelin-associated water from multi-exponential T2 relaxation analysis, but has not yet been applied to the study of reading or dyslexia. In this study, MWF MRI, intelligence, and reading assessments were acquired in 20 participants aged 10-18 years with a wide range of reading ability to investigate the relationship between reading ability and myelination. Group comparisons showed markedly lower MWF by 16-69% in poor readers relative to good readers in the left and right thalamus, as well as the left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right anterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right centrum semiovale, and splenium of the corpus callosum. MWF over the entire group also correlated positively with three different reading scores in the bilateral thalamus as well as white matter, including the splenium of the corpus callosum, left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left anterior limb of the internal capsule, and left centrum semiovale. MWF imaging from T2 relaxation suggests that myelination, particularly in the bilateral thalamus, splenium, and left hemisphere white matter, plays a role in reading abilities. Myelin water imaging thus provides a potentially valuable in vivo imaging tool for the study of dyslexia and its remediation.

We used pupillometry as an objective measure of mental effort and fMRI as an exploratory method of effort with the same musical pieces. We also compared a group of non-professional pianists and non-musicians by the use of pupillometry and a small group of non-musicians with fMRI. This combined approach of psychophysiology and neuroimaging revealed the cognitive work during different musical activities. We found that pupil diameters were largest when "playing" (regardless of whether there was sound produced or not) compared to conditions with no movement (i.e., "listening" and "imagery"). We found positive correlations between pupil diameters of the professional pianist during different conditions with the same piano piece (i.e., normal playing, silenced playing, listen, imagining), which might indicate similar degrees of load on cognitive resources as well as an intimate link between the motor imagery of sound-producing body motions and gestures. We also confirmed that musical imagery had a strong commonality with music listening in both pianists and musically naive individuals. Neuroimaging provided evidence for a relationship between noradrenergic (NE) activity and mental workload or attentional intensity within the domain of music cognition. We found effort related activity in the superior part of the locus coeruleus (LC) and, similarly to the pupil, the listening and imagery engaged less the LC-NE network than the motor condition. The pianists attended more intensively to the most difficult piece than the non-musicians since they showed larger pupils for the most difficult piece. Non-musicians were the most engaged by the music listening task, suggesting that the amount of attention allocated for the same task may follow a hierarchy of expertise demanding less attentional effort in expert or performers than in novices. In the professional pianist, we found only weak evidence for a commonality between subjective effort (as rated measure-by-measure) and the objective effort gauged with pupil diameter during listening. We suggest that psychophysiological methods like pupillometry can index mental effort in a manner that is not available to subjective awareness or introspection.

The cross-sectional survey included questions on past 30 day prescription opioid use (10,965 provided responses; 278 age 17 to 18 years who used opioids in past 30 days), with NMU defined as non-oral use and/or use of someone else's opioids. Nonparametric survival analysis with lifetable estimates was used to examine age at first use. Binomial logistic regression was conducted predicting any NMU, adjusted for covariates.Results:Among 278 youth 17 to 18 years, a significant difference in age of first use between those with MU only and any NMU (p < .0001) was observed. Each one year increase in age resulted in a 33% decrease in the odds of any prescription opioid NMU compared to MU only, after controlling for covariates (Odds Ratio = 0.67, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.47,0.96). Sex differences in age at first use were not observed.Conclusions:Risk of past 30 day prescription opioid NMU decreased by a third for each one year increase in age of first use, after adjustment for other covariates. Use of prescription opioids in young adolescents may need to be limited where possible and researched further.

Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling and self-completed a computer questionnaire every six months. We used multi-level generalized mixed-effect models to evaluate trends in recent CM use (past six months), multivariable logistic regression to identify covariates of recent CM use, and multivariable survival analysis to identify predictors of CM initiation.Results:Of 207 GBMSM living with HIV at enrollment, 44.3% reported recent CM use; there was a statistically non-significant decrease over the study period (41% in first period to 25% in final period,p = 0.087). HIV treatment optimism was not associated with CM use/initiation. CM use was positively associated with depressive symptomology, sexual escape motivation, transactional sex, number of anal sex partners, condomless anal sex with seroconcordant partners, STIs, and other substance use. Recent CM use was negatively associated with viral load sorting. CM initiation was predicted by escape motivation, transactional sex, and group sex participation.Conclusion:Results suggest that CM use among GBMSM living with HIV is prevalent and increased CM use/initiation is not a consequence of TasP public policy.

This type of memory is required for completion of many tasks and is adversely affected by SD. However, the cognitive neural mechanism by which SD affects WM, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the changes in the brain network involved in WM after SD. Twenty-two healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while in a state of resting wakefulness and again after 36 h of total SD and performed a WM task before each scanning session. Nineteen main nodes of the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), salience network (SN), and other networks were selected for functional analysis of brain network connections. Functional connectivity measures were computed between seed areas for region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis and to identify patterns of ROI-to-ROI connectivity. The relationship between the significant changes in functional connectivity in the brain network and WM performance were then examined by Pearson's correlation analysis. WM performance declined significantly after SD. Compared with the awake state, the functional connectivity between DAN and DMN significantly increased after SD while that between FPN and DMN significantly decreased. Correlation analysis showed that the enhanced functional connectivity between DAN and DMN was negatively correlated with the decline in WM performance and that the decline in functional connectivity between FPN and DMN was positively correlated with decreased WM performance. These findings suggested that SD may affect WM by altering the functional connectivity among DMN, DAN, and FPN.

However, it is unclear if whole-body maximal motor tasks are also governed by this mechanism. Maximum vertical squat jumps were performed by 15 young adults before cooling, then immediately following a 15-min cooling period using an ice-water bath for the foot soles, and finally immediately following a 15-min period of natural recovery from cooling. Jump heights were, on average, 3.1 cm lower immediately following cooling compared to before cooling (p= 3.39 x 10(-8)) and 1.9 cm lower following natural recovery from cooling (p= 0.00124). The average vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) was also lower by 78.2 N in the condition immediately following cooling compared to before cooling (p= 8.1 x 10(-5)) and 56.7N lower following natural recovery from cooling (p= 0.0043). The current study supports the S1-to-M1 overflow mechanism in a whole-body dynamic jump.

Much of the information regarding neuronal correlates of visual processing has been derived from functional imaging studies, which have identified a variety of brain areas contributing to visual analysis, recognition, and processing of objects and scenes. However, only two of these areas, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the lateral occipital complex (LOC), were verified and further characterized by intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). iEEG is a unique measurement technique that samples a local neuronal population with high temporal and anatomical resolution. In the present study, we aimed to expand on previous reports and examine brain activity for selectivity of scenes and objects in the broadband high-gamma frequency range (50-150 Hz). We collected iEEG data from 27 epileptic patients while they watched a series of images, containing objects and scenes, and we identified 375 bipolar channels responding to at least one of these two categories. Using K-means clustering, we delineated their brain localization. In addition to the two areas described previously, we detected significant responses in two other scene-selective areas, not yet reported by any electrophysiological studies; namely the occipital place area (OPA) and the retrosplenial complex. Moreover, using iEEG we revealed a much broader network underlying visual processing than that described to date, using specialized functional imaging experimental designs. Here, we report the selective brain areas for scene processing include the posterior collateral sulcus and the anterior temporal region, which were already shown to be related to scene novelty and landmark naming. The object-selective responses appeared in the parietal, frontal, and temporal regions connected with tool use and object recognition. The temporal analyses specified the time course of the category selectivity through the dorsal and ventral visual streams. The receiver operating characteristic analyses identified the PPA and the fusiform portion of the LOC as being the most selective for scenes and objects, respectively. Our findings represent a valuable overview of visual processing selectivity for scenes and objects based on iEEG analyses and thus, contribute to a better understanding of visual processing in the human brain.

J	Tetereva, Alina; Kartashov, Sergey; Ivanitsky, Alexey; Martynova, Olga								Variance and Scale-Free Properties of Resting-State Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Signal After Fear Memory Acquisition and Extinction								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						509075	10.3389/fnhum.2020.509075			OCT 9 2020	2020	Recently, the dynamic properties of brain activity rather than its stationary values have attracted more interest in clinical applications. It has been shown that brain signals exhibit scale-free dynamics or long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) that differ between rest and cognitive tasks in healthy controls and clinical groups. Little is known about how fear-inducing tasks may influence dispersion and the LRTC of subsequent resting-state brain activity. In this study, we aimed to explore the changes in the variance and scale-free properties of the brain's blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during the resting-state sessions before and after fear learning and fear memory extinction. During a 1-h break between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, 23 healthy, right-handed volunteers experienced a fear extinction procedure, followed by Pavlovian fear conditioning that included partial reinforcement using mild electrical stimulation. We extracted the average time course of the BOLD signal from 245 regions of interest (ROIs) taken from the resting-state functional atlas. The variance of the BOLD signal and the Hurst exponent (H), which reflects the scale-free dynamic, were compared in the resting states before and after fear learning and fear memory extinction. After fear extinction, six ROIs showed a difference in H at the uncorrected level of significance, including areas associated with fear processing. H decreased during fear extinction but then became higher than before fear learning, specifically in areas related to the fear extinction network (FEN). However, activity in the other ROIs restored the H to its initial level. The variance of the BOLD signal in six ROIs demonstrated a significant increase from initial rest to the post-task rest. A limited number of ROIs showed changes in both H and variance. Our results imply that the variability and scale-free properties of the BOLD signal might serve as additional indicators of changes in spontaneous brain activity related to recent experience.

This study aimed to create a cross-culturally adapted Hebrew version, JEF-C(H)(c) and to assess reliability and validity in the Israeli context. Forty typically developing Israeli children and adolescents, aged 11-18 years, were assessed with JEF-C(H)(c). In addition, participants and their parents filled in the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). JEF-C(H)(c) was found to be feasible in Israeli children and adolescents. The internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79). Most of the JEF-C(H)(c) subtests and the Average score showed significant positive moderate to high correlations with age, ranging from 0.40 to 0.78 demonstrating construct validity. Multiple significant correlations were also found between the JEF-C(H)(c) Average score and the BRIEF indices as well as total score in the Parent and Self-report questionnaires. These preliminary findings support the reliability and validity of this version. Current findings demonstrate the potential clinical utility of JEF-C(H)(c) as an ecologically valid tool for Israeli children and adolescents in the assessment of EFs.

We used multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) to investigate whether the time course of the deployment of covert spatial attention leading up to the observer's perceptual decision can be decoded from both EEG alpha power and raw activity traces. Decoding attention from these signals can help determine whether raw EEG signals and alpha power reflect the same or distinct features of attentional selection. Using a classical cueing task, we showed that the orientation of covert spatial attention can be decoded by both signals. However, raw activity and alpha power may reflect different features of spatial attention, with alpha power more associated with the orientation of covert attention in space and raw activity with the influence of attention on perceptual processes.

However, the effect of stimulus modality on EEG patterns within this process is less understood. To fill this research gap, the present study re-analyzed EEG datasets recorded during visual and audiovisual equivalence learning tasks from earlier studies. The number of associations required to be maintained (WM load) in WM was increased using the staircase method during the acquisition phase of the tasks. The support vector machine algorithm was employed to predict WM load and stimulus modality using the power, phase connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) values obtained during time segments with different WM loads in the visual and audiovisual tasks. A high accuracy (>90%) in predicting stimulus modality based on power spectral density and from the theta-beta CFC was observed. However, accuracy in predicting WM load was higher (>= 75% accuracy) than that in predicting stimulus modality (which was at chance level) using theta and alpha phase connectivity. Under low WM load conditions, this connectivity was highest between the frontal and parieto-occipital channels. The results validated our findings from earlier studies that dissociated stimulus modality based on power-spectra and CFC during equivalence learning. Furthermore, the results emphasized the importance of alpha and theta frontoparietal connectivity in WM load.

Children With Autism Produce a Unique Pattern of EEG Microstates During an Eyes Closed Resting-State Condition								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						288	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00288			OCT 8 2020	2020	Although fMRI studies have produced considerable evidence for differences in the spatial connectivity of resting-state brain networks in persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relative to typically developing (TD) peers, little is known about the temporal dynamics of these brain networks in ASD. The aim of this study was to examine the EEG microstate architecture in children with ASD as compared to TD at rest in two separate conditions - eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO). EEG microstate analysis was performed on resting-state data of 13 ASD and 13 TD children matched on age, gender, and IQ. We found that children with ASD and TD peers produced topographically similar canonical microstates at rest. Group differences in the duration and frequency of these microstates were found primarily in the EC resting-state condition. In line with previous fMRI findings that have reported differences in spatial connectivity within the salience network (previously correlated with the activity of microstate C) in ASD, we found that the duration of activation of microstate C was increased, and the frequency of microstate C was decreased in ASD as compared to TD in EC resting-state. Functionally, these results may be reflective of alterations in interoceptive processes in ASD. These results suggest a unique pattern of EEG microstate architecture in ASD relative to TD during resting-states and also that EEG microstate parameters in ASD are susceptible to differences in resting-state conditions.

While visuomotor tasks have been rigorously employed for cognitive evaluation in chronic liver disease, there is a paucity of auditory processing task. Here we focused on auditory perception and examined behavioral and haemodynamic responses to a melodic contour identification task (CIT) to compare cognitive abilities in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD,N= 30) and healthy controls (N= 25). Further, we used support vector machines to examine the optimal combination of channels of functional near-infrared spectroscopy that can classify cognitive alterations in CLD. Behavioral findings showed that CIT performance was significantly worse in the patient group and CIT significantly correlated with neurocognitive evaluation (i.e., number connection test, digit span test). The findings indicated that CIT can measure auditory cognitive capacity and its difference existing between patient group and healthy controls. Additionally, optimal subsets classified the 16-dimensional haemodynamic data with 78.35% classification accuracy, yielding markers of cognitive alterations in the prefrontal regions (CH6, CH7, CH10, CH13, CH14, and CH16). The results confirmed the potential use of behavioral as well as haemodynamic responses to music perception as an alternative or supplementary method for evaluating cognitive alterations in chronic liver disease.

The current study investigated the association between brain response to different food odors with varied energy density and individual changes of body mass index (BMI) over 2 years. Twenty-five participants received high-fat (chocolate and peanut), low-fat (bread and peach) food odors, and a nonfood odor (rose) while the brain activation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). BMIs were calculated with participant's self-reported body weight and height collected at the time of the fMRI scan and again at 2 years later. Regression analyses revealed significant negative correlations between BMI increase over 2 years and brain activation of the bilateral precuneus and the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in response to high-fat vs. low-fat food odors. Also, brain activation of the right supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to food vs. non-food odor was negatively correlated to subsequent BMI increase over 2 years. Taken together, the current findings suggest that individual differences in neural responsivity to (high calorie) food odors in brain regions of the default mode and motor control network serve as a neural marker for future BMI change.

The olfactory ability of individuals with ASD has been examined in several psychophysical studies, but the results have been highly variable, which might be primarily due to methodological difficulties in the control of odor stimuli (e.g., the problem of lingering scents). In addition, the neural correlates of olfactory specificities in individuals with ASD remain largely unknown. To date, only one study has investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present study utilized a sophisticated method-a pulse ejection system-to present well-controlled odor stimuli to participants with ASD using an ASD-friendly application. With this advantageous system, we examined their odor detection, identification, and evaluation abilities and measured their brain activity evoked by odors using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). As the odor detection threshold (DT) of participants with ASD was highly variable, these participants were divided into two groups according to their DT: an ASD-Low DT group and an ASD-High DT group. Behavioral results showed that the ASD-High DT group had a significantly higher DT than the typically developing (control) group and the ASD-Low DT group, indicating their insensitivity to the tested odors. In addition, while there was no significant difference in the odor identification ability between groups, there was some discrepancy between the groups' evaluations of odor pleasantness. The brain data identified, for the first time, that neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly weaker in the ASD-High DT group than in the control group. Moreover, the strength of activity in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with the DT. These findings suggest that participants with ASD have impairments in the higher-order function of olfactory processing, such as olfactory working memory and/or attention.

We recently demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and reversibility of FUS-induced BBB opening in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in six participants with early AD. We now report the effect of BBB opening with FUS treatment on beta-amyloid plaque. Six participants underwent F-18-Florbetaben PET scan at baseline and 1 week after the completion of the third FUS treatment (60 days interval). PET analysis comparing the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the treated and untreated hemispheres revealed a decrease in the ratio of F-18-Florbetaben ligand binding. The standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) reduction ranged from 2.7% to 10% with an average of 5.05% (+/- 2.76) suggesting a decrease in beta-amyloid plaque.

Recently, subjective significance was found to be an additional factor describing the activational aspect of emotional reactions, which is vital for the cognitive consequences of emotional stimuli processing. Subjective significance represents the form of mental activation specific to reflective mind processing. The Lexical Decision Task (LDT) is a paradigm allowing the investigation of the involuntary processing of meaning and differentiating this processing from the formal processing of the perceptual features of words. In this study, we wanted to search for the consequences of valence, arousal, and subjective significance for the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli meaning indexed by both behavioral measures (reaction latencies) and electrophysiological measures (Event-Related Potentials: ERPs). We expected subjective significance, as the reflective form of activation, to shorten response latencies in LDT. We also expected subjective significance to modulate the amplitude of the ERP FN400 component, reducing the negative-going deflection of the potential. We expected valence to shape the LPC component amplitude, differentiating between negative and positive valences, since the LPC indexes the meaning processing. Indeed, the results confirmed our expectations and showed that subjective significance is a factor independent from the arousal and valence that shapes the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli, especially the detection of a link between stimulus and meaning indexed by the FN400. Moreover, we found that the LPC amplitude was differentiated by valence level.

Understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie the potential smartphone dependence may help develop interventions to address this important problem. In this exploratory study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying potential smartphone dependence in a sample of 19 adolescent volunteers who completed self-assessments of their smartphone dependence, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems. All 19 adolescents underwent diffusion MRI that allowed for assessment of white matter structural connectivity within the framework of connectomics. Based on previous literature on the neurobiology of addiction, we hypothesized a disruption of network centrality of three nodes in the mesolimbic network: Nucleus Accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala. Our results showed positive correlations between the node centrality of the right amygdala and self-reported smartphone dependence, between smartphone dependence and sleep problems, and between sleep problems and depressive symptoms. A higher phone dependence was observed in females compared to males. Supported by these results, we propose a model of how smartphone dependence can be linked to aberrations in brain networks, sex, sleep disturbances, and depression in adolescents.

Moreover, autistic symptoms show a continuity in the general population and are referred to as autistic traits in people without an ASD diagnosis. One of the symptoms of ASD is sensory processing differences both in sensitivity and perception. To investigate sensory processing differences in autistic traits, we examined auditory and visual processing in a healthy population. We recruited 75 individuals (39 females and 36 males, mean age = 23.01 years, SD = 3.23 years) and assessed autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, and sensory sensitivity using the Sensory Sensitivity Scales. Sensory processing in the visual domain was examined with the radial motion stimulus and the auditory domain was assessed with the 1,000 Hz pure tone stimulus with electroencephalography-evoked potentials. The results showed that the auditory sensitivity scores of the males (r(aud) (34) = 0.396, p(aud) = 0.017) and the visual sensitivity scores of females were correlated with autistic traits (r(vis) (37) = 0.420, p(vis) = 0.008). Moreover, the P2 latency for the auditory stimulus was prolonged in the participants with a higher level of autistic traits (r(s) (61) = 0.411, p = 0.008), and this correlation was only observed in males (r(s) (31) = 0.542, p = 0.001). We propose that auditory processing differences are related to autistic traits in neurotypicals, particularly in males. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering sex differences in autistic traits and ASD.

The present study explores the role of two types of concurrent signals in error correction: predicted visual reafferences coming from an internal representation of the hand, and actual visual feedback from the hand. While the role of sensory feedback in these corrections is well-established, much less is known about sensory prediction. The relative contributions of these two types of signals remain a subject of debate, as they are naturally interconnected. We address the issue in a study that compares online correction of an artificially induced, undetected planning error. Two conditions are tested, which only differ with respect to the accuracy of predicted visual reafferences. In the first, "Prism" experiment, a planning error is introduced by prisms that laterally displace the seen hand prior to hand movement onset. The prism-induced conflict between visual and proprioceptive inputs of the hand also generates an erroneous prediction of visual reafferences of the moving hand. In the second, "Jump" experiment, a planning error is introduced by a jump in the target position, during the orienting saccade, prior to hand movement onset. In the latter condition, predicted reafferences of the hand remained intact. In both experiments, after hand movement onset, the hand was either visible or hidden, which enabled us to manipulate the presence (or absence) of visual feedback during movement execution. The Prism experiment highlighted late and reduced correction of the planning error, even when natural visual feedback of the moving hand was available. In the Jump experiment, early and automatic corrections of the planning error were observed, even in the absence of visual feedback from the moving hand. Therefore, when predicted reafferences were accurate (the Jump experiment), visual feedback was processed rapidly and automatically. When they were erroneous (the Prism experiment), the same visual feedback was less efficient, and required voluntary, and late, control. Our study clearly demonstrates that in natural environments, reliable prediction is critical in the preprocessing of visual feedback, for fast and accurate movement.

Speech segmentation based on the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity can be used to estimate segmental contributions to perception in noisy conditions. High-RMS-level segments contain crucial information for speech perception. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of high-RMS-level speech segments on auditory attention decoding performance under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Scalp EEG signals were recorded when subjects listened to the attended speech stream in the mixed speech narrated concurrently by two Mandarin speakers. The temporal response function was used to identify the attended speech from EEG responses of tracking to the temporal envelopes of intact speech and high-RMS-level speech segments alone, respectively. Auditory decoding performance was then analyzed under various SNR conditions by comparing EEG correlations to the attended and ignored speech streams. The accuracy of auditory attention decoding based on the temporal envelope with high-RMS-level speech segments was not inferior to that based on the temporal envelope of intact speech. Cortical activity correlated more strongly with attended than with ignored speech under different SNR conditions. These results suggest that EEG recordings corresponding to high-RMS-level speech segments carry crucial information for the identification and tracking of attended speech in the presence of background noise. This study also showed that with the modulation of auditory attention, attended speech can be decoded more robustly from neural activity than from behavioral measures under a wide range of SNR.

Reduced Frontal Nogo-N2 With Uncompromised Response Inhibition During Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation-More Efficient Cognitive Control?								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						561780	10.3389/fnhum.2020.561780			OCT 6 2020	2020	We have previously shown invasive vagus nerve stimulation to improve attention and working memory and alter emotion-attention interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy, suggesting that VNS might be useful in the treatment of cognitive impairment. The current research focuses on whether non-invasive, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has similar effects to VNS. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether tVNS has an impact on cognitive control in general or on underlying brain physiology in a task that mimics everyday life demands where multiple executive functions are engaged while encountering intervening emotional stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERP) evoked in such a task, specifically centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 were used as biomarkers for attention allocation and cognitive control required to carry out the task. A single-blinded, sham-controlled, within-subject study on healthy subjects (n= 25) was conducted using Executive Reaction Time Test (RT-test), a Go/NoGo task engaging multiple executive functions along with intervening threat-related distractors while EEG was recorded. tVNS at the left tragus and sham stimulation at the left ear lobe was alternately delivered throughout the task. To assess the impact of tVNS on neural activity underlying attention and cognitive control, centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 peak amplitudes were measured in Go and NoGo conditions. Task performance was assessed with RTs and different error types reflecting cognitive control in general and distinct executive functions, such as working memory and response inhibition.No significant effects due to tVNS on performance in the Executive RT-test were observed. For N2 there was a main effect of stimulator status and a significant interaction of trial type (Go, NoGo) and stimulator status.Post hocanalysis revealed that tVNS resulted in a significant reduction of frontal N2 only in the NoGo condition. No significant effects were observed for P3 nor were there any effects of emotion. Diminished NoGo-N2 potential along with unaltered task performance during tVNS suggests fewer cognitive control resources were required to successfully withhold a prepotent response. Though caution is warranted, we suggest that tVNS may lead to more efficient neural processing with fewer resources needed for successful cognitive control, providing promise for its potential use in cognitive enhancement.

The effect of psychotropic drugs on movement inhibition is largely unknown. Movement stopping can be estimated by the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT). In a recent publication, we validated an improved measure of SSRT (optimum combination SSRT, ocSSRT). Here we explored how diazepam, which enhances transmission at GABA(A)receptors, affects ocSSRT. Methods: Nine healthy individuals were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg doses of diazepam. Each participant received both the dosage of drug and placebo orally on separate days with adequate washout. The ocSSRT and simple reaction time (RT) were estimated through a stop-signal task deliveredviaa battery-operated box incorporating green (Go) and red (Stop) light-emitting diodes. The task was performed just before and 1 h after dosing. Result: The mean change in ocSSRT after 10 mg diazepam was significantly higher (+27 ms) than for placebo (-1 ms;p= 0.012). By contrast, the mean change in simple response time remained comparable in all three dosing groups (p= 0.419). Conclusion: Our results confirm that a single therapeutic adult dose of diazepam can alter motor inhibition in drug naive healthy individuals. The selective effect of diazepam on ocSSRT but not simple RT suggests that GABAergic neurons may play a critical role in movement-stopping.

Contraction Phase and Force Differentially Change Motor Evoked Potential Recruitment Slope and Interhemispheric Inhibition in Young Versus Old								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						581008	10.3389/fnhum.2020.581008			OCT 6 2020	2020	Interhemispheric interactions are important for arm coordination and hemispheric specialization. Unilateral voluntary static contraction is known to increase bilateral corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. It is unknown how increasing and decreasing contraction affect the opposite limb. Since dynamic muscle contraction is more ecologically relevant to daily activities, we studied MEP recruitment using a novel method and short interval interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from active to resting hemisphere at 4 phases of contralateral ECR contraction: Rest, Ramp Up [increasing at 25% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], Execution (tonic at 50% MVC), and Ramp Down (relaxation at 25% MVC) in 42 healthy adults. We analyzed the linear portion of resting extensor carpi radialis (ECR) MEP recruitment by stimulating at multiple intensities and comparing slopes, expressed as mV per TMS stimulation level, via linear mixed modeling. In younger participants (age <= 30), resting ECR MEP recruitment slopes were significantly and equally larger both at Ramp Up (slope increase = 0.047,p< 0.001) and Ramp Down (slope increase = 0.031,p< 0.001) compared to rest, despite opposite directions of force change. In contrast, Active ECR MEP recruitment slopes were larger in Ramp Down than all other phases (Rest:0.184,p< 0.001; Ramp Up:0.128,p= 0.001; Execution:p= 0.003). Older (age >= 60) participants' resting MEP recruitment slope was higher than younger participants across all phases. IHI did not reduce MEP recruitment slope equally in old compared to young. In conclusion, our data indicate that MEP recruitment slope in the resting limb is affected by the homologous active limb contraction force, irrespective of the direction of force change. The active arm MEP recruitment slope, in contrast, remains relatively unaffected. Older participants had steeper MEP recruitment slopes and less interhemispheric inhibition compared to younger participants.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						569010	10.3389/fnhum.2020.569010			OCT 6 2020	2020	Background The beneficial effects of acute exercise on executive function have been well-documented, but the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness on this effect requires further investigations, especially using imaging technique. This study aimed to examine the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on acute exercise-induced changes on behavioral performance and on functional brain activation. Method Based on their cardiorespiratory fitness level, 62 participants ranked in the top and bottom of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO(2)max) were finally selected and allocated to high-fit group or low-fit group. Both groups were asked to complete the Stroop task after 30 min of aerobic exercise and chair-seated rest (control session). Among them, 26 participants were randomly selected and asked to undergo the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Results Behavioral results showed that individuals responded significantly faster after exercise than those in the control session. The fMRI results revealed a significant interaction effects of Group by Session in brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the ACC, activation in the high-fit group was significantly decreased after aerobic exercise compared to those in the control session; whereas an increased activation was noticed in the low-fit group. Regarding to the bilateral DLPFC, activation in high-fit group was significantly decreased after exercise compared to those in the control session, while no significant differences were found in the low-fit group. In addition, for the post-exercise session, a significant positive correlations between activation of the ACC and left DLPFC in the high-fit group was observed. There was a significant negative correlation between activation of the ACC and reaction time in the congruent condition after exercise in the low-fit group. Conclusion Findings further clarify the neurophysiological processes of acute exercise-induced changes in cognitive performance as they suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor which influences changes in brain activation patterns in response to acute aerobic exercises.

However, specific treatment techniques and modifications designed to accommodate this population are understudied. Using a single-case experimental design, the current study investigated the utility of modified Video Implemented Script Training for Aphasia (VISTA) for an individual with nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia and severe-to-profound, bilateral hearing loss. We analyzed the impact of this intervention, which incorporates orthographic input and rehearsal, on script production accuracy, speech intelligibility, grammatical complexity, mean length of utterance, and speech rate. Treatment resulted in comparable positive outcomes relative to a previous study evaluating script training in nonfluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia patients with functional hearing. Follow-up data obtained at three months, six months, and one year post-treatment confirmed maintenance of treatment effects for trained scripts. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate a modified speech-language intervention tailored to the needs of an individual with PPA and hearing loss, with findings confirming that simple treatment modifications may serve to broaden the range of treatment options available to those with concomitant sensory and communication impairments.

Lack of knowledge about contraception may be contributing to inadequate contraceptive use.Objectives:To compare contraceptive knowledge among women and men receiving mOUD relative to a comparison group seeking primary care.Methods:We surveyed 332 reproductive-age women and men receiving mOUD or primary care with the recently validated 25-item Contraceptive Knowledge Assessment. We examined overall differences between patient groups and between females and males using two-way analyses of variance; individual item differences were tested using logistic regression.Results:The mean percent of total correct responses was lower among individuals receiving mOUD (n = 167) relative to the comparison group (n = 165), 47.7% vs. 53.8%, respectively (p< .001), and higher among females (n = 169) relative to males (n = 163), 56.1% vs. 45.2%, respectively (p< .001). Individual item analyses revealed patient group and sex differences primarily in the areas of contraceptive efficacy, attributes of contraceptive methods, and fertility awareness.Conclusion:While there were modest differences between patient groups and sexes, the results suggest a deficit in contraceptive knowledge across all groups. Substance use disorder treatment clinics could be an opportunistic setting in which to provide accurate information about contraception to patients with OUD and other substance use disorders.

To account for these changes in fMRI activation signal, we used breath-hold tasks to mimic hemodynamic changes in brain tumor subjects and scaled the activation response. Methods:Motor and/or language fMRI was performed in 21 subjects with brain tumor. A breath-hold task was also performed in these subjects to obtain the hemodynamic response changes independent of neural changes. The task activation signals were calibrated on a voxel wise basis for all the subjects. Direct cortical stimulation was used to verify the scaled results of task-based fMRI. Results:After scaling for the hemodynamic response function (HRF) on a voxel wise basis, the spatial extent of the scaled activation was more clustered together and appeared to minimize false positives. Similarly, accounting for the underlying canonical HRF, the percentage increase of active voxels after scaling had lower standard non-deviation suggesting that the activation response across voxels were more similar. Conclusion:Although preliminary in nature, this study suggests that the variation in hemodynamic changes can be calibrated using breath-hold in brain tumor subjects and can also be used for other clinical cases where the underlying HRF has been altered.

Outcomes included the feasibility and acceptability of the VIA-IS, and its use in setting goals in a BI rehabilitation context, and whether it affected types of goals set (International Classification of Functioning (ICF)). Memory for goals two weeks later was measured, and a sample size calculated for a full-scale trial. Twenty-six BI participants were recruited, and randomized to the VIA-IS (n = 13) and control group (n = 13). Two dropped out of the VIA-IS condition, leaving a totaln = 24. The majority (92%) of participants rated the VIA-IS as acceptable; both groups described the goal-setting process as "easy". VIA-IS feedback varied; over two thirds (73%) of VIA-IS participants used their VIA-IS results to set goals and described it as "helpful". There were no major differences in ICF categories between groups. A sample size of 66 would be required for a full-scale trial. A full-scale trial with multi-centre design appears warranted though might be more clinically beneficial for difficult to engage BI clients.

Telemedicine has morphed from niche service to essential platform, with newly released guidelines that cover various aspects of tele-mental health delivery. Rehabilitation services, which incorporate a range of psychosocial interventions and liaison services, have been significantly impacted too. They are currently more institute-based than community-based in India. However, recent legislation has mandated that community-based rehabilitation options be available. While a large treatment gap for mental health issues has always existed, telemedicine provides an opportunity to scale services up to minimize this gap. Community-based rehabilitation can be delivered over various platforms, from text to phone to videoconferencing, and various devices. Telemedicine is cost-effective, and enables delivery of services where existing services are inadequate. The recent guidelines allow other healthcare workers to be involved in mental health service delivery. Hence, in addition to direct delivery of services, telerehabilitation can facilitate task-shifting, with mental health professionals mentoring and supervising existing human resources, such as ASHA workers, VRWs, DMHP programme staff, and others. Tele-rehabilitation also poses challenges - not all needs can be met; access and privacy can be a problem in resource-scarce settings; liaison with existing services is required; and organisations need to plan appropriately and re-allocate resources. Digital access to welfare benefits and interventions must be expanded without disadvantaging those without internet access. Yet, many rehabilitation interventions can be adapted to telemedicine platforms smoothly, and task-shifting can broaden access to care for persons with disability.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a sharp spike in the utilization of telepsychiatry due to ongoing restrictions on gatherings and traveling. In recognition of the importance of telemedicine in general, and telepsychiatry specifically, telemedicine practice guidelines and telepsychiatry operational guidelines have been released. Due to the rising trend in telemedicine, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDIA) incorporated teleconsultation health insurance coverage at a level on par with regular in-person consultations. In contrast, in the United States of America, private insurance coverage for telepsychiatry has been in vogue for some time. In this paper we draw comparisons between India and the United States on telepsychiatry and health insurance. We compare the evolving regulatory policies of these two countries in relation to existing insurances plans that are available, the challenges in implementation of new regulations and the possible ways to overcome the challenges to make telepsychiatry affordable to all.

In India, telemedicine services remain poorly adopted and integrated due to various barriers. The important reasons are lack of legal and administrative clarity in using technology for service delivery and inertia from health service providers to adopt newer developments. However, during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, these equations are changing. The Telemedicine practice guidelines released in March, 2020, and Telepsychiatry operational guidelines released in May, 2020, appear to remove these barriers and promote equitable access to health care. In this article, the authors discuss the scope of these guidelines.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this digital transformation, and changes that usually take many years to translate into clinical practice have been implemented in a matter of weeks. These have outpaced the checks and balances that would typically accompany such changes, which has brought into focus a need to have a proper approach for digital data handling. Health care data is sensitive, and is prone to hacking due to the lack of stringent protocols regarding its storage and access. Mental health care data need to be more secure due to the stigma associated with having a mental health condition. Thus, there is a need to emphasize proper data handling by mental health professionals, and policies to ensure safeguarding patient's privacy are required. The aim of useful, free, and fair use of mental health care data for clinical, business, and research purposes should be balanced with the need to ensure the data is accessible to only those who are authorized. Systems and policies should be in place to ensure that data storage, access, and disposal are systematic and conform to data safety norms.

The information about the technological, administrative, and clinical challenges is being addressed by the telemedicine and TP guidelines published by several individual nations. TP aims to address the treatment gaps, barriers for utilization, accessibility, diagnostic validity, financial implications, and individual client preferences. Utilization of TP in the OPD varies from country to country depending upon their healthcare delivery systems. It also varies in populations utilizing the TP services-urban, rural, child and adolescent, geriatric, and differently abled. TP services in the OPDs are being incorporated differentially by government organizations, insurance recognized psychiatric healthcare organizations, private psychiatric group practice deliverers, and individual, standalone psychiatric healthcare deliverers. TP may not replace the traditional in-person consultations completely. Covid-19 pandemic has hastened its utilization across several healthcare delivery systems. Healthcare organizations, clinicians, other healthcare deliverers, and end users are in the process of adapting to the new scenario. Incorporation of the big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other technological advances in the psychiatric healthcare delivery systems into TP services in the OPDs would significantly contribute to the overall quality and efficacy of the psychiatric healthcare delivery systems in the future.

The present trial introduces psychological well-being, an increasingly recognized factor in cardiovascular health, as a therapeutic target. Objective: This study was designed to determine whether the sequential combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and well-being therapy (WBT) may yield more favorable outcomes than an active control group (clinical management; CM) and to identify subgroups of patients at greater risk for cardiac negative outcomes. Methods: This multicenter RCT comparedCBT/WBT sequential combination versus CM, with up to 30 months of follow-up. One hundred consecutive depressed and/or demoralized patients (out of 740 initially screened by cardiologists after a first episode of ACS) were randomized to CBT/WBT associated with lifestyle suggestions (n = 50) and CM (n = 50). The main outcome measures included: severity of depressive symptoms according to the Clinical Interview for Depression, changes in subclinical psychological distress, well-being, and biomarkers, and medical complications and events. Results: CBT/WBT sequential combination was associated with a significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared to CM. In both groups, the benefits persisted at follow-up, even though the differences faded. Treatment was also related to a significant amelioration of biomarkers (platelet count, HDL, and D-dimer), whereas the 2 groups showed similar frequencies of adverse cardiac events. Conclusions: Addressing psychological well-being in the psychotherapeutic approach to ACS patients with depressive symptoms was found to entail important clinical benefits. It is argued that lifestyle changes geared toward cardiovascular health may be facilitated by a personalized approach that targets well-being.

Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) is one candidate treatment method. Objective: To review and meta-analyze, where possible, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of STPP for FSD. Methods: Following a systematic search of the literature, we performed a meta-analysis of available RCT groups to determine the effects of STPP on a range of outcomes after treatment, and medium- and long-term follow-ups. Results: In meta-analyses of 17 RCTs, STPP significantly outperformed minimal treatment, treatment as usual, or waiting list controls on somatic symptom measures at all time frames, with small to large magnitude effect sizes. Descriptive reviews of 5 RCTs suggest that STPP performed at least as well as other bona fide psychological therapies. Limitations of this meta-analysis include small samples of studies and possible publication bias. Conclusions: STPP is a valid treatment option for diverse FSD conditions resulting in somatic symptom reductions that persist over time. STPP should be included in FSD treatment guidelines.

However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. Objective: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. Methods: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. Results: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. Conclusions: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.		[Schaefer, Sarah K.; Sopp, M.

This study primarily aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a videoconferencing format of the Making Sense of Brain Tumour (Tele-MAST) programme. Recruited from a multidisciplinary brain tumour clinic, participants were randomly allocated to the 10-session Tele-MAST programme or standard care, with the latter group offered Tele-MAST after re-assessment. Semi-structured interviews explored participants' experiences of receiving psychological support via the videoconferencing platform. Measures of mental health and quality of life were administered at pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments. Of the 35 patients deemed eligible for the study, 14 (40% accrual) with high grade (71%) or low grade (29%) glioma participated. They were randomized to the Tele-MAST condition (n = 8) or standard care/waitlist (n = 6). Ten individuals commenced the Tele-MAST programme, of whom eight completed >= 8 sessions. The major themes that depicted their experience of the Tele-MAST programme were ease of access and benefits of remote delivery, tailored support and immediacy, and sense of connection versus disconnection. Most participants (63%) demonstrated clinically reliable improvement at post-intervention. These preliminary findings support the feasibility and acceptability of remote delivery of psychological support and highlight the need for a larger-scale evaluation of the Tele-MAST programme.

However, there is little evidence regarding the neural regions that are active while children engage in pretend play. We examined the activation of prefrontal and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) regions using near-infrared spectroscopy while 42 4- to 8-year-old children freely played with dolls or tablet games with a social partner or by themselves. Social play activated right prefrontal regions more than solo play. Children engaged the pSTS during solo doll play but not during solo tablet play, suggesting they were rehearsing social cognitive skills more with dolls. These findings suggest social play utilizes multiple neural regions and highlight how doll play can achieve similar patterns of activation, even when children play by themselves. Doll play may provide a unique opportunity for children to practice social interactions important for developing social-emotional skills, such as empathy.

The problem with most of these online concussion assessments is that they predominantly rely on consumer grade technology. Typical administration of these reaction time tests involves presenting a visual stimulus on a computer monitor and prompting the test subject to respond as quickly as possible via keypad or computer mouse. However, inherent delays and variabilities are introduced to the reaction time measure by both computer and associated operating systems that the concussion assessment tool is installed on. The authors hypothesized systems that are typically used to collect concussion reaction time data would demonstrate significant errors in reaction time measurements. To remove human bias, a series of experiments was conducted robotically to assess timing errors introduced by reaction time tests under four different conditions. In the first condition, a visual reaction time test was conducted by flashing a visual stimulus on a computer monitor. Detection was via photodiode and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The second condition employed a mobile device for the visual stimulus, and the mechanical response was delivered to the mobile device's touchscreen. The third condition simulated a tactile reaction time test, and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The fourth condition also simulated a tactile reaction time test, but response was delivered to a dedicated device designed to store the interval between stimulus delivery and response, thus bypassing any problems hypothesized to be introduced by computer and/or computer software. There were significant differences in the range of responses recorded from the four different conditions with the reaction time collected from visual stimulus on a mobile device being the worst and the device with dedicated hardware designed for the task being the best. The results suggest that some of the commonly used visual tasks on consumer grade computers could be (and have been) introducing significant errors for reaction time testing and that dedicated hardware designed for the reaction time task is needed to minimize testing errors.

Prior therapeutic experiences and patients' expectations may affect the capacity to respond to placebos in chronic disorders. Objective: The scope of this study in 763 chronic orofacial pain and healthy study participants was to compare the magnitude and prevalence of placebo effects and determine the putative role of prior therapeutic experiences vs. expectations. Methods: We tested placebo propensity in a laboratory setting by using 2 distinct levels of individually tailored painful stimulations (high pain and low pain) to reinforce expectations and provide a hypoalgesic experience (conditioning phase). Afterwards, both levels of pain were surreptitiously set at a moderate pain level to test for placebo effects (testing phase). Pain and expectation ratings were assessed as primary outcomes using visual analog scales. Results: In both chronic pain and healthy participants, placebo effects were similar in magnitude, with the larger prevalence of responders in the healthy participants. Although chronic pain participants reported higher pain relief expectations, expectations did not account for the occurrence of placebo effects. Rather, prior experience via conditioning strength mediated placebo effects in both pain and healthy participants. Conclusions: These findings indicate that participants with chronic pain conditions display robust placebo effects that are not mediated by expectations but are instead directly linked to prior therapeutic experiences. This confirms the importance of assessing the therapeutic history while raising questions about the utility of expectation ratings. Future research is needed to enhance prediction of responses to placebos, which will ultimately improve clinical trial designs.

Objective: We aimed to do so for the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Methods: Patients from a large real-world sample treated with inpatient psychotherapy (n = 4,791) rated improvements in symptoms on a global 5-point Likert scale at discharge. These ratings were related to pre-post changes in the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the SCL-90-R by use of equipercentile linking. Results: A patient rating of 5 ("clearly improved") was found to be equivalent to an absolute pre-post difference in the GSI of 0.67 or to a percentage improvement of 54%, with the latter corresponding to the common definition of response as a 50% reduction in symptoms. A rating of 1 ("clearly worse") was equivalent to an increase in the GSI >0.50 and to a percentage worsening >55%. "Slightly improved" or "slightly worse" (ratings of 4 or 2) corresponded to pre-post changes in the GSI of 0.07 and 0.50. For severely disordered patients, larger changes were required for ratings of improvement, and for less severely disordered patients, larger changes were required for ratings of worsening. Results for depressive, anxiety, and personality disorders were widely consistent with those of the total sample. Conclusions: This study is the first to link patient ratings of improvement or worsening to changes in the SCL-90-R. Results are relevant to both the interpretation of changes in individual patients and of effect sizes in outcome research. Results require replication.

Objective: This study uniquely sought to elucidate the network structure, its change, and its predictive value in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for binge-eating disorder (BED). Methods: In a multicenter randomized trial of face-to-face and Internet-based guided self-help CBT, 178 individuals with full syndrome and subsyndromal BED, eating disorder and general psychopathology, and body mass index (BMI) were subjected to Gaussian Graphical Network and Exploratory Graph Analyses before and after treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Results: At pretreatment, 3 network communities of: eating disorder psychopathology; general psychopathology; and restraint and BMI were identified, with the latter community included in the first thereafter. Eating disorder-related impairment and self-esteem were the most central symptoms, while BMI and binge eating had the lowest centrality. Network connectivity significantly increased from pre- to posttreatment, with the greatest increases in strength centrality found in binge eating and shape concern, but it did not predict remission from binge eating. Conclusions: With decreasing symptom severity, CBT resulted in a greater integration and connectivity of the psychopathology network in BED, suggesting an increased patient understanding of relations between binge eating and other symptoms. Network connectivity was not a negative prognostic indicator of treatment outcome. These results indicate a need for further research on the predictive value of network variables in the explanation of therapeutic change for patients with BED.

A key insight from evolutionary studies on morality is that natural selection should favor both diversity and fluidity in morality. Moral diversity is evidenced by moral psychological research on within- and cross-society variations in the endorsement of moral concerns. Moral fluidity is exhibited in the conditional expression of moral hypocrisy, situational effects on intuitive versus rational moral processing, and environmental effects on the degree of prosociality. From this perspective, empirical methods and evolutionary models can be combined in future research to better explicate how morality develops and manifests in various environments.

J	Hill, Sarah E.								The Next Big Question in Evolutionary Psychology Is "How Does It Work"?								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	4			332	335		10.1037/ebs0000206			OCT 2020	2020	Over the past 30 years, the field of evolutionary psychology has made tremendous strides in identifying the adaptive function(s) served by numerous features of human nature. In so doing, the field has provided researchers in psychology new insights into the design of the human mind. As the field continues to mature, however, the next big question that needs to be addressed by evolutionary psychologists in their research is "how does it work?" That is. the next breakthroughs in our understanding of psychological function and dysfunction will come from research that is explicit in defining the neurobiological underpinnings of proposed psychological adaptations. In the following, I describe how incorporating insights from neuroscience will move the field forward vertically by advancing our understanding of the processes through which the brain generates fitness-promoting behaviors across a range of environments. Further, such an integration will give neuroscience-a field that, although methodologically rigorous, tends to be overly myopic and lacking a strong theoretical backbone-a much-needed metatheory.

Answers to this important question will more than likely require an understanding and application of the evolutionary mismatch framework. This powerful framework suggests that many of our contemporary problems-ranging from diabetes and depression to low fertility and sustainability-stem from a mismatch between our evolved psychological mechanisms, which are designed to be adaptive in ancestral contexts, and modern environments, which present novel stimuli that these mechanisms are not well suited to handle. By providing a better understanding of the functions of our evolved mechanisms and how they are incompatible with modem environments, the mismatch perspective can help with the generation of more enlightened and effective strategies to tackle modem problems than would otherwise be the case. We describe this perspective and discuss its potential efficacy and promise.

Evolutionary Psychology Is a Scientific Revolution								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	4			316	323		10.1037/ebs0000210			OCT 2020	2020	Evolutionary psychology provides a cogent meta-theory for psychological science.

Evolutionary psychology provides a sound scientific framework for understanding human nature-one that is consilient with known causal processes of all life forms, particularly natural and sexual selection. Empirical evidence continues to accumulate for the heuristic and predictive power of the evolutionary psychology meta-theory, supporting the case for a scientific revolution in psychology.

This study investigates the dynamics of ocular accommodation and pupil size in a population of children with ADHD (6-14 years old) and assesses the association between these ocular variables with behavioural performance during a continuous performance task. The accommodation and pupil dynamics (magnitude and variability) were objectively measured, using the WAM-5500 auto-refractor, during the execution of a -14-min continuous performance task in a sample of twenty-three non-medicated children with ADHD and thirty-one controls of a similar age range. Our data revealed that children with ADHD present a reduced accommodative response (higher lags of accommodation) during the execution of a continuous performance task. However, no group-differences were observed for the other ocular indices. Both groups experienced changes in all ocular variables as a function of time-on-task. The variability of accommodation and pupil diameter were associated with several indicators of behavioural performance for the ADHD group. However, no bivariate correlations were found for the control group. The current outcomes suggest that the accommodation and pupil dynamics may be considered as potential predictors of behavioural performance, which could help to improve the robustness of ADHD diagnosis.

EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	4			384	389		10.1037/ebs0000216			OCT 2020	2020	In this article, we identify some of the major obstacles that have hindered the development of a general theory of individual differences in evolutionary psychology. These obstacles include inattention to particular types of individual differences and failure to consider new findings in fields such as behavior genetics, neuroscience, cultural psychology, and psychopathology. We also identify key challenges to developing an evolutionary psychological theory of individual differences, including Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic-centric sampling and the variable impact of development and ecology on individual differences. We end with a discussion on how evolutionary psychology could meet the challenge of a general theory of individual differences by incorporating new methodologies, findings from other disciplines, and focusing on aspects of individual differences that have received little attention in the past.

Binocular rivalry from luminance and contrast								VISION RESEARCH				175				41	50		10.1016/j.visres.2020.06.006			OCT 2020	2020	Binocular rivalry is the phenomenon that when two incompatible images are simultaneously presented, one to each eye, the two images compete with each other to be the dominant percept. Studying the underlying neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry is useful for understanding the mechanisms of interocular inhibition. Levelt's Propositions, a set of four propositions that were originally published over fifty years ago, are not only useful for characterizing the perceptual dynamics of binocular rivalry, but can also provide a metric for assessing the common or differential neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry when diverse stimulus types are used. In the present study, we conducted a series of psychophysics experiments, where we compared the rivalry dynamics of two quite different types of stimuli. Orthogonal gratings, a classic type of rivalry stimulus, were contrasted with luminance patches, a type of rivalry stimulus that is relatively less studied. Our results showed that, similar to the orthogonal gratings, the alternate percepts in luminance-only rivalry were described by the modified Levelt's Propositions, despite the clearly slower alternation rates for luminance patches. However, unlike the mixed percepts observed during transitions between oriented gratings, fusion percepts during luminance rivalry were common, could be lustrous, and obeyed the same Propositions, suggesting a regime of tri-stability. Overall, both types of rivalry are consistent with recent models that posit separate binocular and monocular channels embedded within neural circuits that also accomplish contrast normalization. Finally, luminance rivalry is discussed in the contexts of binocular summation and suppression, as well as Fechner's paradox.

Consequently, all evolved functional organization found in the human architecture was constructed by selection, as a response to and a reflection of the functional demands of ancestrally recurring adaptive problems. The adaptive problems our ancestors faced selected for programs that can recognize mates, cooperation, tights. offspring, alliances, and so forth, and guide behavior appropriately for each. To achieve this, these programs necessarily evolved with native content built in, out of which meaningful but abstract situation representations are constructed by the mind in response to evolutionarily meaningful cues (e.g., my child is hungry. our rivals are trying to subordinate us). These programs evolved to guide us in social interactions according to their internal programming logics. These program logics, once reverse-engineered, can be used to construct a unified, theoretically principled social science that can model and explain cultural dynamics, economics, social organization. and even historically particular social phenomena, such as moralities, mobs, and revolutions. Unfortunately, modern humans live in a vastly expanded arena of interacting billions, while our systems of situation representation are designed for the ancestral world of foraging bands involving hundreds. Worse, these systems are informed by cues that no longer reliably mean what they once signaled, effectively causing hallucinations. So, we are ignorant armies clashing by night, lost among hallucinated misinterpretations that no longer correspond to the actual world. An awakening clarity might emerge from progress toward an evolutionarily informed, fully integrated social science.

Some explanations give special, fundamental status to a subset of colour categories. We argue that a subset of colour categories, if fundamental, will be coherent - meaning that a non-trivial criterion distinguishes them from the other colour categories. We test the coherence of subsets of achromatic (white, black and grey), primary (white, black, red, green, yellow, blue) and basic (primaries plus brown, orange, purple, pink and grey) colour categories in English. Criteria for defining colour categories were expressed in terms of behavioural, linguistic and geometric features derived from colour naming and linguistic usage data; and were discovered using machine learning methods. We find that achromatic and basic colour categories are coherent subsets but not primaries. These results support claims that the basic colour categories have special status, and undermine claims about the fundamental role of primaries in colour naming systems.

Interestingly, even though evolutionary behavioral scientists traditionally aim to provide the ultimate explanations of behavior, they lag behind in applying the same level of causation in explaining the cold reception of their discipline. Here, we differentiate between the "how" and the "why" to explain human determination in proving their exceptionalism from the rest of the natural world. Deeper understanding of these motivations might result in interventions aimed at changing the popularly held view of this field as "bad science."

On the other hand, individual differences approaches have been able to identify a structure of spatiotemporal filters too. In this same fashion-through an individual differences approach-the present study aims to uncover a structure of spatiotemporal frequency selective motion mechanisms. This is done, for the first time, using supra-threshold contrast stimuli in a motion direction discrimination task. Two experiments were performed measuring duration thresholds for drifting 2D Gabor gratings of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 6 c/deg. They moved with a speed of 2 deg/sec, with Michelson contrasts of 0.1 or 0.9 (Experiment 1) or had a contrast of 0.9 drifting with a temporal frequency of 2 Hz or 8 Hz (Experiment 2). Principal component analyses uncover three factors in each of four conditions. When Varimax-rotated, these are seen to be selective to spatial frequencies lower than 0.5 c/deg, intermediate ones from 0.5 to 1-1.5 c/deg, and frequencies greater than 1-1.5 c/deg. Direct Oblimin rotations indicate that factors are moderately correlated. Further analyses show very slight differences in the correlational structures between contrast conditions (0.1 vs. 0.9), and no differences between temporal frequency conditions (2 Hz vs. 8 Hz). To conclude, the idea of a three-factor structure in motion processing for low, intermediate, and high spatial frequencies is supported.

Angular tuning of tilt illusion depends on stimulus duration								VISION RESEARCH				175				85	89		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.007			OCT 2020	2020	In the tilt illusion, the orientation of a central stimulus appears tilted away from a surrounding stimulus when angular difference is between 0 deg and 50 deg. Studies have repeatedly shown that the tilt illusion exhibits the strongest effect with the angular difference around 15 deg and this angular tuning is robust to various changes in stimulus parameters. We revisited the well-reported angular tuning of the tilt illusion, in relation to the recently-reported modulation of illusion magnitude by stimulus duration. We examined the tilt illusion with a wide range of stimulus duration (10-640 ms) and angular difference (7.5-75.0 deg). The results confirmed that the peak magnitude of the tilt illusion increased with shorter durations. However, we also found that the position of the peak shifted to larger angular differences with shorter durations. Evidently, the angular tuning profile of the tilt illusion is not fixed but can change with stimulus duration. The peak shift may be explained if orientation-selective lateral inhibition responsible for the tilt illusion sharpens its tuning over time.

The current paper focuses on a two-system model comprising two human existence systems: (a) biological evolution of humans and other species and (b) the psychological life-meaning system of human beliefs. To address this Darwin-God dilemma, nature-based totemic psychology serves as a bridge to understand these two systems while simultaneously inquiring into the meaning of human existence and life itself, both then and now.

Neural correlates of task-related refixation behavior								VISION RESEARCH				175				90	101		10.1016/j.visres.2020.07.001			OCT 2020	2020	Eye movement research has shown that attention shifts from the currently fixated location to the next before a saccade is executed. We investigated whether the cost of the attention shift depends on higher-order processing at the time of fixation, in particular on visual working memory load differences between fixations and refixations on task-relevant items. The attention shift is reflected in EEG activity in the saccade-related potential (SRP). In a free viewing task involving visual search and memorization of multiple targets amongst distractors, we compared the SRP in first fixations versus refixations on targets and distractors. The task-relevance of targets implies that more information will be loaded in memory (e.g. both identity and location) than for distractors (e.g. location only). First fixations will involve greater memory load than refixations, since first fixations involve loading of new items, while refixations involve rehearsal of previously visited items. The SRP in the interval preceding the saccade away from a target or distractor revealed that saccade preparation is affected by task-relevance and refixation behavior. For task-relevant items only, we found longer fixation duration and higher SRP amplitudes for first fixations than for refixations over the occipital region and the opposite effect over the frontal region. Our findings provide first neurophysiological evidence that working memory loading of task-relevant information at fixation affects saccade planning.

It is comprised of two different configurations, the first one modeling its visual system in air (unaccommodated state) and the second one representing the case where the eye is immersed in water (accommodated state). The model was designed using available data of former studies, image analysis and the implementation of feasible assumptions that serve as starting values. An optimization process incorporating an optical design program is used to vary the starting values with the aim of finding the setup offering the best acuity. The image quality was measured using the root-mean-square radius of the focal spot formed on the retina. The resulting schematic eye model comprises all relevant optical specifications, including aspherical geometrical parameters for cornea and lens, distances between the surfaces, the gradient index distribution of the lens, the retinal specifications and the object distance in both media. It achieves a spot radius of 4.20 mu m for the unaccommodated state, which meets the expectations derived by the mean ganglion cell density and comparison with other animals. In contrast, under water the determined spot radius of 11.48 mu m indicates an acuity loss. As well as enhancing our understanding of the vision of the hooded merganser, the schematic eye model may also serve as a simulation basis for examing similar animal eyes, such as the cormorant or other fish hunting birds.

J	Ayhan, Inci; Ozbagci, Duygu								Action-induced changes in the perceived temporal features of visual events								VISION RESEARCH				175				1	13		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.008			OCT 2020	2020	Perceived duration can be subject to deviations around the time of a voluntary action. Whether the mechanisms underlying action-induced visual duration effects are effector-specific or require a more generalized action-linked multimodal calibration with the transient visual system, however, is a question yet to be answered. Here, we investigate this using dynamic visual stimuli presented as contingent upon the execution of an arbitrarily associated voluntary manual response. Our results demonstrate that the duration of intervals with arbitrarily associated keypress-visual event pair is perceived as shorter than the duration in a pure visual condition, where the same stimuli are rather passively observed without the execution of a concurrent action. Whereas the control experiments show that motor memory and attention cannot explain the action-induced changes in perceived temporal features, action-induced changes in perceived speed are dissociated from those in perceived duration, and that the duration compression disappears using isoluminant or static stimuli, which together provide evidence that these two effects can be modulated in the motion-processing units, although via separate neural mechanisms.

One of the benefits of the field is that it has attracted researchers from a broad range of backgrounds who use a variety of different methodologies to examine human universals and individual differences. In recent years, the field of psychology as a whole has had to grapple with the "replication crisis" and a resulting crisis of confidence in the findings of psychological science. This short article highlights some of the advantages the adaptationist approach can provide in addressing these concerns and the roles of ecological validity and conceptual replications in this process.

Selection history is relative								VISION RESEARCH				175				23	31		10.1016/j.visres.2020.06.004			OCT 2020	2020	Visual attention can be tuned to specific features to aid in visual search. The way in which these search strategies are established and maintained is flexible, reflecting goal-directed attentional control, but can exert a persistent effect on selection that remains even when these strategies are no longer advantageous, reflecting an attentional bias driven by selection history. Apart from feature-specific search, recent studies have shown that attention can be tuned to target-nontarget relationships. Here we tested whether a relational search strategy continues to bias attention in a subsequent task, where the relationally better color and former target color both serve as distractors (Experiment 1) or as potential targets (Experiment 2). We demonstrate that a relational bias can persist in a subsequent task in which color serves as a task-irrelevant feature, both impairing and facilitating visual search performance. Our findings extend our understanding of the relational account of attentional control and the nature of selection history effects on attention.

J	Xie, Xin-Yu; Zhao, Xing-Nan; Yu, Cong								Perceptual learning of motion direction discrimination: Location specificity and the uncertain roles of dorsal and ventral areas								VISION RESEARCH				175				51	57		10.1016/j.visres.2020.06.003			OCT 2020	2020	One interesting observation of perceptual learning is the asymmetric transfer between stimuli at different external noise levels: learning at zero/low noise can transfer significantly to the same stimulus at high noise, but not vice versa. The mechanisms underlying this asymmetric transfer have been investigated by psychophysical, neurophysiological, brain imaging, and computational modeling studies. One study (PNAS 113 (2016) 5724-5729) reported that rTMS stimulations of dorsal and ventral areas impair motion direction discrimination of moving dot stimuli at 40% coherent ("noisy") and 100% coherent (zero-noise) levels, respectively. However, after direction training at 100% coherence, only rTMS stimulation of the ventral cortex is effective, disturbing direction discrimination at both coherence levels. These results were interpreted as learning-induced changes of functional specializations of visual areas. We have concerns with the behavioral data of this study. First, contrary to the report of highly location-specific motion direction learning, our replicating experiment showed substantial learning transfer (e.g., transfer/learning ratio = 81.9%. vs 14.8% at 100% coherence). Second and more importantly, we found complete transfer of direction learning from 40% to 100% coherence, a critical baseline that is missing in this study. The transfer effect suggests that similar brain mechanisms underlie motion direction processing at two coherence levels. Therefore, this study's conclusions regarding the roles of dorsal and ventral areas in motion direction processing at two coherence levels, as well as the effects of perceptual learning, are not supported by proper experimental evidence. It remains unexplained why distinct impacts of dorsal and ventral rTMS stimulations on motion direction discrimination were observed.

The specific aim of the study was to determine which brain areas are associated with the initial decline of olfaction in elderly subjects, which occurs before the onset of dementia. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure anatomical brain volume and cortical thickness, and subjects were assessed using tests of olfactory acuity and cognitive function measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Overall brain volume reductions were observed in elderly subjects compared with young healthy controls, but only reduction in the volume of the left hippocampus was associated with decreased olfactory ability. The parahippocampus of elderly subjects was not different from that of controls; the extent of the reduction of parahippocampus volume varied among individuals, and reduction in this region was associated with olfactory decline. Similarly, parahippocampus thinning was associated with decreased olfactory function. The path analysis showed direct and indirect effects of hippocampus and parahippocampus volume on olfactory ability and that volume reductions in these areas were not associated with cognitive function. Parahippocampus volume reduction and thinning exhibited individual variation; this may be the first appearance of pathological changes and may lead to dysfunction in the connection of olfactory memory to the neocortex. Parahippocampus change may reflect the first sign of olfactory impairment prior to pathological changes in the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.

A Randomized Controlled Trial								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						575403	10.3389/fnhum.2020.575403			SEP 30 2020	2020	Attention deficits are among the most common cognitive impairments observed after experiencing stroke. However, a very limited number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of interventions that specifically focus on the rehabilitation of attention deficits among subjects with impaired attention. Although several interventions have included the use of computerized programs to provide dynamic stimuli, real-time performance feedback, and motivating tasks, existing studies have not exploited the potential benefits of multi-user interactions. Group-based and competitive interventions have been reported to be more enjoyable and motivating, depending on individual traits, and may potentially be more demanding, which may increase their effectiveness. This study investigated the effectiveness and motivating abilities of an intervention specifically designed to address attention deficits. This intervention combined paper-and-pencil tasks and interactive, computerized, multi-touch exercises, which were administered, either non-competitively or competitively, to a group of 43 individuals with chronic stroke. The mediating effects of competitiveness were evaluated for both intervention effectiveness and motivation. Participants were randomly sorted into two groups and underwent 20 one-hour group-based sessions, during which they either worked individually or competed with peers, according to their group allocation. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention, using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, the d2 Test of Attention, the Color Trail Test, the Digit Span Test, and the Spatial Span Test. The competitiveness and subjective experiences of the participants after the intervention were investigated with the Revised Competitiveness Index and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, respectively. The results showed that participants who competed demonstrated significantly greater improvements in all cognitive abilities, except for divided attention, and reported greater enjoyment than their non-competitive peers. Both groups reported comparable levels of perceived competence, pressure, and usefulness. Interestingly, the competitiveness of the participants did not alter either the effectiveness or the subjective experience of the intervention. These findings suggest that competition might enhance the effectiveness and enjoyment of rehabilitation interventions designed to address attention deficits in individuals post-stroke, regardless of their level of competitiveness and without having a negative effect on their perceived pressure and competence.

These segmented leads have demonstrated enlarged therapeutic windows and have thus the potential to improve the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to record directional local field potentials. Here, we investigated whether directional local field potentials can help identify the best stimulation direction to assist device programming. Four Parkinson's disease patients underwent routine implantation of the subthalamic nucleus. Firstly, local field potentials were recorded in three directions for two conditions: In one condition, the patient was at rest; in the other condition, the patient's arm was moved. Secondly, current thresholds for therapeutic and side effects were identified intraoperatively for directional stimulation. Therapeutic windows were calculated from these two thresholds. Thirdly, the spectral power of the total beta band (13-35 Hz) and its sub-bands low, high, and peak beta were analyzedpost hoc. Fourthly, the spectral power was used by different algorithms to predict the ranking of directions. The spectral power profiles were patient-specific, and spectral peaks were found both in the low beta band (13-20 Hz) and in the high beta band (20.5-35 Hz). The direction with the highest spectral power in the total beta band was most indicative of the 1(st)best direction when defined by therapeutic window. Based on the total beta band, the resting condition and the moving condition were similarly predictive about the direction ranking and classified 83.3% of directions correctly. However, different algorithms were needed to predict the ranking defined by therapeutic window or therapeutic current threshold. Directional local field potentials may help predict the best stimulation direction. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better distinguish the informative value of different conditions and the beta sub-bands.		[Nguyen, T. A.

This tool condensed results of a 3-h exam into a five-point scale ranging from 1 (least) to 5 (most) cognitive concern for DBS surgery. In this study, we evaluated the role of the DBS-CRS in clinical decisions by the interdisciplinary team to proceed to surgery, its relationship to objective neuropsychological scores, and its predictive utility for clinical outcome. We retrospectively examined 189 patients with Parkinson's disease who were evaluated for DBS candidacy (mean age 64.8 [SD9.2], disease duration 8.9 years [SD5.0], UPDRS-Part III off medication 38.5 [SD10.5], Dementia Rating Scale-II 135.4 [SD6.0]). Approximately 19% of patients did not proceed to surgery, with neuropsychological red flags being the most commonly documented reason (57%). Patients who underwent DBS surgery had significantly better DBS-CRS scores than those who did not (p< 0.001). The two strongest and unique neuropsychological contributors to DBS-CRS ratings were delayed memory and executive function, followed by language and visuoperception, based on hierarchical linear regression that accounted for 77.2% of the variance. In terms of outcome, DBS-CRS scores were associated with higher quality of life, less severe motor symptoms, and better daily functioning 6 months following DBS surgery. Together, these findings support the construct and predictive validity of the DBS-CRS as a concise tool for effectively communicating pre-DBS cognitive concerns to an interdisciplinary team, thereby aiding decision making in potential DBS candidates.

Cognitive-motor interference effects during DT, such as decreased walking speed and increased step-to-step variability, have a high predictive value for fall risk and cognitive decline. Previously we showed the feasibility of DT during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an MRI-compatible stepping device. Here, we improved the DT-fMRI protocol with respect to task difficulty and signal robustness, making it more suitable for individualized analysis to better understand the neuronal substrates of cognitive-motor interference effects. Thirty healthy elderly subjects performed cognitive and motor single tasks (ST; stepping or finger tapping), as well as combined cognitive-motor DT during fMRI. After whole brain group level analysis, a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and the computation of dual task costs (DTC = activation difference ratio ST/DT) at individual level were performed. Activations in the primary (M1) and secondary motor as well as in parietal and prefrontal cortex were measured at the group level during DT. Motor areas showed decreased activation whereas parietal and prefrontal areas showed increased activation in DT vs. ST. Stepping yielded more distinctive activations in DT vs. ST than finger tapping. At the individual level, the most robust activations (based on occurrence probability and signal strength) were measured in the stepping condition, in M1, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus (SPL/IPS). The distribution of individual DTC in SPL/IPS during stepping suggested a separation of subjects in groups with high vs. low DTC. This study proposes an improved cognitive-motor DT-fMRI protocol and a standardized analysis routine of functional neuronal markers for cognitive-motor interference at the individual level.

The present study aims to probe alterations of voxel-wise brain-wide FC in patient with DED at rest in an unbiased way. Method:A total of 20 patients with DED and 23 controls matched by age, sex, and years of education underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Global-brain FC (GFC) was adopted to analyze the images. Support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to differentiate the patients from the controls. Results:Compared with the controls, patients with DED exhibited decreased GFC in the right cerebellum lobule VIII/inferior semi-lunar lobule and left thalamus that belonged to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. The GFC values in the left thalamus were positively correlated to the illness duration (r= 0.589,p= 0.006) in the patients. Decreased GFC values in the left thalamus could be used to discriminate the patients from the controls with optimal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (88.37, 85.00, and 91.30%). Conclusions:Our findings indicate that decreased GFC in the brain regions associated with cerebello-thalamo-cortical network may provide a new insight for understanding the pathological changes of FC in DED. GFC values in the left thalamus may be utilized as a potential biomarker to identify the patients from the controls.

In this longitudinal study, a 34-year-old male with sensory- and motor-complete SCI (C5/C6) underwent two consecutive interventions: 61 h of supine lower limb ES (ES-alone) followed by 51 h of ES combined with stand training (ST) using an overhead body-weight support (BWS) system (ST + ES). In post ES-alone (unloaded), compared to baseline, the majority (similar to 60%) of lower extremity muscles decreased their peak surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude, while in post ST + ES (loaded), compared to post ES-alone, there was a restoration in muscle activation that endured the continuous 10-min stepping. Temporal alpha-motor neuron activity patterns were observed for the SCI participant. In post ST + ES, there were increases in spinal activity patterns during mid-stance at spinal levels L5-S2 for the right and left limbs. Moreover, in post ES-alone, trunk stability increased with excursions from the midline of the base-of-support (50%) to the left (44.2%; Baseline: 54.2%) and right (66.4%; baseline: 77.5%). The least amount of trunk excursion observed post ST + ES, from midline to left (43%; AB: 22%) and right (64%; AB: 64%). Overall, in post ES-alone, there were gains in trunk independence with a decrease in lower limb muscle activation, whereas in post ST + ES, there were gains in trunk independence and increased muscle activation in both bilateral trunk muscles as well as lower limb muscles during the treadmill stepping paradigm. The results of the study illustrate the importance of loading during the stimulation for neural and mechanical gains.

Billions of dollars per year are put towards changing human behavior, but it is difficult to know which messages will be the most persuasive in the field. By combining novel neuroimaging techniques and large-scale online data, we examine the role of key health communication variables relevant to motivating action at scale. We exposed a sample of smokers to anti-smoking web-banner messages from a real-world campaign while measuring message-evoked brain response patternsviafMRI, and we also obtained subjective evaluations of each banner. Neural indices were derived based on: (i) message-evoked activity in specific brain regions; and (ii) spatially distributed response patterns, both selected based on prior research and theoretical considerations. Next, we connected the neural and subjective data with an independent, objective outcome of message success, which is the per-banner click-through rate in the real-world campaign. Results show that messages evoking brain responses more similar to signatures of negative emotion and vividness had lower online click-through-rates. This strategy helps to connect and integrate the rapidly growing body of knowledge about brain function with formative research and outcome evaluation of health campaigns, and could ultimately further disease prevention efforts.

Balance control involving the complex interaction among nervous, muscular, and sensory systems should be maintained to keep an upright posture and prevent falls. Vestibular sensation is one of the main senses essential for postural control. Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is a noninvasive stimulation method for vestibular organs. Recently, it has received increasing attention for the treatment of balance disorders. However, the effect of balance disorders on stimulus effect during the implementation of nGVS remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of different floor surface and visual conditions on the stimulus effects of the nGVS intervention. In this study, two experiments were conducted with 24 participants (12 each for Experiments 1 and 2). In Experiment 1, nGVS (0.4 mA; 0.1-640 Hz) was performed in the open-eyes standing position on a solid surface (nGVS condition) and in the closed-eye standing position on a foam rubber (nGVS + foam rubber condition). In Experiment 2, sham stimulation was performed under the same conditions as in Experiment 1, except for nGVS. Center of pressure (COP) sway was measured in all participants with them standing with open eyes at Pre and Post-1 (immediately after the intervention) and Post-2 (10 min after the measurement of post-1). In Experiment 1, under the nGVS condition, COP sway was significantly reduced in Post-1 and Post-2 compared with Pre. However, no significant difference was observed among Pre, Post-1, and Post-2 under the nGVS + foam rubber condition. Furthermore, the intervention effect was significantly greater in the nGVS condition than in the nGVS + foam rubber condition. In contrast, in Experiment 2, the COP sway did not significantly differ among Pre, Post-1, and Post-2 under either condition. Based on the results of this study, nGVS was found to be effective with open-eyes standing on a solid surface.

SL has been studied using mainly behavioral tasks under implicit conditions and with triplets presenting the same level of difficulty, i.e., a mean transitional probability (TP) of 1.00. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying SL under other learning conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neurofunctional correlates of SL using triplets (i.e., three-syllable nonsense words) with a mean TP of 1.00 (easy "words") and 0.50 (hard "words") in an SL task performed under incidental (implicit) and intentional (explicit) conditions, to determine whether the same core mechanisms were recruited to assist learning. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants listened firstly to a continuous auditory stream made of the concatenation of four easy and four hard "words" under implicit instructions, and subsequently to another auditory stream made of the concatenation of four easy and four hard "words" drawn from another artificial language under explicit instructions. The stream in each of the SL tasks was presented in two consecutive blocks of similar to 3.5-min each (similar to 7-min in total) to further examine how ERP components might change over time. Behavioral measures of SL were collected after the familiarization phase of each SL task by asking participants to perform a two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) task. Results from the 2-AFC tasks revealed a moderate but reliable level of SL, with no differences between conditions. ERPs were, nevertheless, sensitive to the effect of TPs, showing larger amplitudes of N400 for easy "words," as well as to the effect of instructions, with a reduced N250 for "words" presented under explicit conditions. Also, significant differences in the N100 were found as a result of the interaction between TPs, instructions, and the amount of exposure to the auditory stream. Taken together, our findings suggest that triplets' predictability impacts the emergence of "words" representations in the brain both for statistical regularities extracted under incidental and intentional instructions, although the prior knowledge of the "words" seems to favor the recruitment of different SL mechanisms.

This qualitative paper investigates participants' views about a cognitive rehabilitation intervention in a randomized controlled trial (the GREAT trial) and aims to help explain and interpret the findings and to inform further intervention development. Using in-depth thematic analysis, 43 semi-structured interviews (35 individual and 8 dyadic) were conducted with 25 people living with dementia and 26 family carers from three sites. The person-centred, individualized approach was valued. Some participants' views about dementia were questioned as a consequence of taking part in the therapy; they considered the effectiveness of the intervention in the context of the progressive nature of the condition. Certain participants continued to be doubtful, focussing on the inevitability of decline, rather than the possibility of reablement. Such views may have influenced engagement. The therapeutic relationship played a vital role as it was how personalized care was provided and participants' views had changed positively. Therapists engendered greater confidence and reduced anxiety and social isolation. Positive responses support personalized rehabilitative care to address the specific needs of people living with dementia.

To better understand the processing of HD-tDCS interventions, a long-lasting HD-tDCS protocol was applied to 15 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients and 20 minimally conscious states (MCS) patients in this study. Ten minutes of resting-state electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from the patients, and the coma recovery scale-revised scores (CRS-Rs) were assessed for each patient from four time-points (T0, T1, T2, and T3). Brain networks were constructed by calculating the EEG spectral connectivity using the debiased weighted phase lag index (dwPLI) and then quantified the network information transmission efficiency by graph theory. We found that there was an increasing trend in local and global information processing of beta and gamma bands in resting-state functional brain networks during the 14 days of HD-tDCS modulation for MCS patients. Furthermore, the increased functional connectivity not only occurred in the local brain area surrounding the stimulation position but was also present across more global brain areas. Our results suggest that long-lasting HD-tDCS on the precuneus may facilitate information processing among neural populations in MCS patients.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to changes in the functional state of the human brain, showing its potential to help doctors diagnose MDD. In this paper, an approach for identifying MDD by fusing interhemispheric asymmetry and cross-correlation with EEG signals is proposed and tested on 32 subjects [16 patients with MDD and 16 healthy controls (HCs)]. First, the structural features and connectivity features of the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands are extracted on the preprocessed and segmented EEG signals. Second, the structural feature matrix of the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands are added to and subtracted from the connectivity feature matrix to obtain mixed features. Finally, the structural features, connectivity features, and the mixed features are fed to three classifiers to select suitable features for the classification, and it is found that our mode achieves the best classification results using the mixed features. The results are also compared with those from some state-of-the-art methods, and we achieved an accuracy of 94.13%, a sensitivity of 95.74%, a specificity of 93.52%, and an F1-score (f1) of 95.62% on the data from Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University. The study could be generalized to develop a system that may be helpful in clinical purposes.

Are Waterpipe Cafe, Vape Shop, and Traditional Tobacco Retailer Locations Associated with Community Composition and Young Adult Tobacco Use in North Carolina and Virginia?								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	14			2395	2402		10.1080/10826084.2020.1823417			SEP 23 2020	2020	Purpose We examined whether waterpipe cafe, vape shop, and traditional tobacco retailer (e.g. stores selling cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco) locations were associated with census tract composition and tobacco use among young adults in North Carolina and Virginia.Methods:We identified waterpipe cafes, vape shops, and traditional tobacco retailers in North Carolina and Virginia and conducted multivariable analyses between community characteristics (gender, race, ethnicity, education, college enrollment, and poverty) and density per 1000 population. Using fall 2017 data from 1099 young adults residing in North Carolina and Virginia, we conducted logistic regression analyses to determine whether tobacco retailer density and proximity were associated with tobacco use.Results:Waterpipe cafe, vape shop, and traditional retailer density were higher in communities with more people who were Hispanic, college-educated, and college-enrolled (eachp< .05). Waterpipe cafe and traditional retailer density were higher in communities with more people living below the poverty level (eachp< .05). Waterpipe cafe density was higher in communities with more people who were male (p< .05), while traditional retailer density was lower (p< .05). Waterpipe cafe and vape shop proximity were associated with increased likelihood of waterpipe tobacco use in the past 6 months (eachp< .05; unadjusted). Traditional retailer proximity and waterpipe cafe, vape shop, and traditional retailer density were not associated with tobacco use.Conclusions:Waterpipe cafes and vape shops are located in both impoverished and college-educated communities in North Carolina and Virginia, similar to where traditional tobacco retailers are located. Further research is needed to examine associations with tobacco use.

To incorporate an understanding of such gendered influences in future educational materials for men with TBI, as well as their caregivers and clinicians, this qualitative study was informed by social constructionism, and aimed to explore how gender is related to men's post-TBI perceptions and behaviours in rehabilitation and recovery. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 men with mild and moderate-severe TBI at the acute (<= 3 months post-TBI) and chronic (> 3 months post-TBI) phases of injury. A reflexive thematic analysis approach was applied to interview data, guided by the concept of hegemonic masculinity as described by Connell, R.W. (2005.Masculinities[2nd ed.]. Polity). Three key themes were identified: (1) "I'm a man, I'm a rock": Undermining treatment, (2) "I'm going to face that challenge": Facilitation of recovery, and (3) "I don't feel as useful as a guy as I was before": Perceptions on return to work. These findings may be translated into gender-informed therapy strategies and materials.

This study examines factors associated with PrEP awareness and willingness, and identifies perceived barriers to PrEP among PWID.Methods:PWID were interviewed in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA from 2016 to 2018. We analyzed data from self-reported HIV-negative participants who had injected drugs within the past 6 months (n = 469). Questions on PrEP included awareness, willingness, barriers, and uptake. Multiple logistic regression models of factors associated with awareness of, and willingness to, take PrEP were developed. Descriptive statistics on perceived PrEP barriers are reported.Results:Among HIV-negative PWID, 40% were aware of PrEP, 59% reported willingness to take PrEP, and 2% were currently taking PrEP. In multivariable analysis, PrEP awareness was associated with study site and sexual minority status, higher educational attainment, and HIV testing in the last 6 months. Willingness to take PrEP was associated with self-reported risk (paying sex partner in the last 6 months, sharing drug paraphernalia, and being injected by another PWID) and perceived HIV risk. The most common perceived barriers to PrEP were copays, concerns about increased HIV or sexually transmitted risk with PrEP, and concerns about reduction of medication efficacy without daily use.Conclusion:PrEP awareness among PWID remains inadequate. Willingness to take PrEP was moderate and was most desired by PWID who engaged in high-risk behaviors. Interventions to increase PrEP awareness and willingness, and to facilitate PrEP uptake among PWID are needed.

The gene is Angiotensin I Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2). According to the multi-experiment matrix (MEM), the gene exhibiting the most statistically significant co-expression link to ACE2 is Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC). DDC is a crucial enzyme that participates in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin. SARS-CoV2-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression might reduce dopamine and serotonin synthesis, causing hypodopaminergia.Discussion:Indeed, added to the known reduced dopamine function during periods of stress, including social distancing the consequence being both genetic and epigenetic vulnerability to all Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) addictive behaviors. Stress seen in PTSD can generate downstream alterations in immune functions by reducing methylation levels of immune-related genes.Conclusion:Mitigation of these effects by identifying subjects at risk and promoting dopaminergic homeostasis to help regulate stress-relative hypodopaminergia, attenuate fears, and prevent subsequent unwanted drug and non-drug RDS type addictive behaviors seems prudent.

This study examined whether various features of treatment response were predicted by the integrity of one or more of the central cognitive components of spelling: orthographic long-term memory, orthographic working memory, and phoneme-grapheme conversion. Twenty dysgraphic individuals received 12 weeks of bi-weekly, individualized, lexically-based spelling rehabilitation using a spell-study-spell paradigm. Linear multiple regression modelling examined whether the type and severity of the dysgraphic deficit, assessed before rehabilitation, predicted the magnitude and rate of improvement, generalization to untrained items and maintenance of treatment gains. The results revealed that pseudoword spelling accuracy - indexing the integrity of the phoneme-grapheme conversion system - was the only factor examined that significantly predicted the rate of accuracy gains for trained words as well as the extent of generalization to untrained words. Pre-treatment pseudoword spelling accuracy also predicted retention of gains for trained and untrained words at 3-month follow-up. These findings reveal that the integrity of the phoneme-grapheme conversion system prior to dysgraphia rehabilitation may play a key role in rehabilitation-driven recovery, even when the treatment approach targets lexical rather than pseudoword spelling processes.

The present study used continuous behavioral rating and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the dynamic process of tension generation and its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms; specifically, tension induced by structural violations at different music hierarchical levels. In the experiment, twenty-four musicians were required to rate felt tension continuously in real-time, while listening to music sequences with either well-formed structure, phrase violations, or period violations. The behavioral data showed that structural violations gave rise to increasing and accumulating tension experience as the music unfolded; tension was increased dramatically by structural violations. Correspondingly, structural violations elicited N5 at GFP peaks, and induced decreasing neural oscillations power in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz). Furthermore, compared to phrase violations, period violations elicited larger N5 and induced a longer-lasting decrease of power in the alpha band, suggesting a hierarchical manner of musical processing. These results demonstrate the important role of musical structure in the generation of the experience of tension, providing support to the dynamic view of musical emotion and the hierarchical manner of tension processing.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG) exams can provide more reliable data for analysis of this behavior. This paper proposes a new approach for the automatic diagnosis of patients with alcoholism and introduces an analysis of the EEG signals from a two-dimensional perspective according to changes in the neural activity, highlighting the influence of high and low-frequency signals. This approach uses a two-dimensional feature extraction method, as well as the application of recent Computer Vision (CV) techniques, such as Transfer Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The methodology to evaluate our proposal used 21 combinations of the traditional classification methods and 84 combinations of recent CNN architectures used as feature extractors combined with the following classical classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). CNN MobileNet combined with SVM achieved the best results in Accuracy (95.33%), Precision (95.68%), F1-Score (95.24%), and Recall (95.00%). This combination outperformed the traditional methods by up to 8%. Thus, this approach is applicable as a classification stage for computer-aided diagnoses, useful for the triage of patients, and clinical support for the early diagnosis of this disease.

J	Lee, Sung-Mu; Henson, Richard N.; Lin, Chun-Yu								Neural Correlates of Repetition Priming: A Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						565114	10.3389/fnhum.2020.565114			SEP 18 2020	2020	Repetition priming is a form of implicit memory, whereby classification or identification of a stimulus is improved by prior presentation of the same stimulus. Repetition priming is accompanied with a deceased fMRI signal for primed vs. unprimed stimuli in various brain regions, often called "repetition suppression," or RS. Previous studies proposed that RS in posterior regions is associated with priming of perceptual processes, whereas RS in more anterior (prefrontal) regions is associated with priming of conceptual processes. To clarify which regions exhibit reliable RS associated with perceptual and conceptual priming, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis using coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation. This analysis included 65 fMRI studies that (i) employed visual repetition priming during either perceptual or conceptual tasks, (ii) demonstrated behavioral priming, and (iii) reported the results from whole-brain analyses. Our results showed that repetition priming was mainly associated with RS in left inferior frontal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. Importantly, RS in these regions was found for both perceptual and conceptual tasks, and no regions show RS that was selective to one of these tasks. These results question the simple distinction between conceptual and perceptual priming, and suggest consideration of other factors such as stimulus-response bindings.

J	Morse, Helen; Biggart, Laura; Pomeroy, Valerie; Rossit, Stephanie								Exploring perspectives from stroke survivors, carers and clinicians on virtual reality as a precursor to using telerehabilitation for spatial neglect post-stroke; Exploring perspectives from stroke survivors								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	5			707	731		10.1080/09602011.2020.1819827			MAY 28 2022	2022	Spatial neglect is a common and severe cognitive consequence of stroke, yet there is currently no effective rehabilitation tool. Virtual Reality (VR) telerehabilitation tools have the potential to provide multisensory and enjoyable therapies and remotely monitor adherence without the presence of a therapist at all times. Researchers and industry need to better understand end-user perspectives about these technologies to ensure these are acceptable and, ultimately, optimize adherence and efficacy. This study aims to explore end-user perspectives on the use of self-administered VR for spatial neglect in a university environment to identify barriers and facilitators prior to extending its use remotely as a telerehabilitation tool. We used a mixed-method design including focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and interviews with stroke survivors (N = 7), their carers (N = 3) and stroke clinicians (N = 6). End-user perspectives identified clarity of instructions, equipment (cost, available resources) and for some, level of experience with technology as barriers of use. Perceived facilitators were performance feedback, engagement and enjoyment, and psychological benefits associated with self-administered VR telerehabilitation. Overall, end-users were positive and interested in using VR telerehabilitation for spatial neglect. These perspectives enabled us to produce practical recommendations to inform development, enhance engagement and uptake of VR telerehabilitation and inform future studies.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the spatial patterns of spontaneous brain activity in the brain of ONFH patients. Methods: The study included ONFH patients and healthy controls. The pattern of intrinsic brain activity was measured by examining the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals using rs-fMRI. Meanwhile, we also used Harris hip scores to evaluate the functional performance of ONFH patients and healthy controls. Result: Ten ONFH patients and 10 health controls were investigated. We found global ALFF differences between the two groups throughout the occipital, parietal, frontal, prefrontal, and temporal cortices. In the ONFH patients, altered brain activity was found in the brain regions in the sensorimotor network, pain-related network, and emotion and cognition network. The results of the correlation investigations also demonstrated that the regions with ALFF changes had significant correlations with the functional performance of the patients evaluated by Harris hip scores. Conclusions: Our study has revealed the abnormal pattern of brain activity in ONFH patients, and our findings could be used to aid in understanding the mechanisms behind the gait abnormality and intractable pain associated with ONFH at the central level.

To address some of the known shortcomings of traditional analysis and interpretation of CPT data, the present study applied a machine learning-based model (ML) using CPT indices for the Prediction of ADHD.Using a retrospective factorial fitting, followed by a bootstrap technique, we trained, cross-validated, and tested learning models on CPT performance data of 458 children aged 6-12 years (213 children with ADHD and 245 typically developed children). We used the MOXO-CPT version that included visual and auditory stimuli distractors. Results showed that the ML proposed model performed better and had a higher accuracy than the benchmark approach that used clinical data only. Using the CPT total score (that included all four indices: Attention, Timeliness, Hyperactivity, and Impulsiveness), as well as four control variables [age, gender, day of the week (DoW), time of day (ToD)], provided the most salient information for discriminating children with ADHD from their typically developed peers. This model had an accuracy rate of 87%, a sensitivity rate of 89%, and a specificity rate of 84%. This performance was 34% higher than the best-achieved accuracy of the benchmark model. The ML detection model could classify children with ADHD with high accuracy based on CPT performance. ML model of ADHD holds the promise of enhancing, perhaps complementing, behavioral assessment and may be used as a supportive measure in the evaluation of ADHD.

Movement Kinematics and Interjoint Coordination Are Influenced by Target Location and Arm in 6-Year-Old Children								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						554378	10.3389/fnhum.2020.554378			SEP 16 2020	2020	Rapid aiming movements are typically used to study upper limb motor control and development. Despite the large corpus of work in this area, few studies have examined kinematic manual asymmetries in children who have just started formal schooling and until now, none have characterized how children coordinate their joints to complete these movements (i.e., interjoint coordination). In the present study, manual asymmetries in kinematics and interjoint coordination in strongly right-handed 6-year-old children were investigated when reaching for ipsilateral and contralateral targets with their dominant right arm and the non-dominant left arm. Overall, manual asymmetries in interjoint coordination are apparent for both 6-year-old children and young adults, although young children completed the task by adopting a different strategy than adults. Also, control strategies employed by 6-year-old children were influenced by both the location of the target as well as the arm used to perform the task. Specifically, compared to all other conditions, children's trajectories were more curved when performing contralateral movements with the non-dominant left arm, which were driven by smaller shoulder excursions combined with larger elbow excursions for this condition. Based on these results, we argue that the differences in interjoint coordination reflect the stage of development of 6-year-old children, the origin of which derives from maturational (e.g., hand dominance) and environmental factors (e.g., school-based experience).

Low perceived risk of substance use, which is linked to actual behavior, may contribute to low rates of engagement in community prevention efforts for substance use. To examine this, the current study used a mixed methods approach to: (1) examine the relationship between engagement in prevention education and substance use; and, (2) analyze qualitative data on education programs offered in the community to help identify strengths and gaps in prevention resources.Method:Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from adolescents (age 13-18) and young adults (age 19-25) living in the Southeast, recruited from local schools and community events to participate in a preventive intervention focused on prevention of HIV, substance use, and other risky behaviors. Prior to engagement in this intervention, self-report questionnaires were completed by adolescents assessing: substance use, perceived risk, and engagement in substance use education classes. Focus groups were also conducted with adolescents recruited from a local high school and young adults recruited from local colleges to obtain additional information about engagement in education programs.Results:Regarding perceived risk, 71.8% of adolescents reported moderate to great risk in having five or more drinks once or twice a week and 43% of adolescents reported moderate to great risk in smoking cannabis once or twice a week. Forty-four percent of adolescents had talked to one of their parents about the dangers of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use in the past year. Further, 18% of adolescents had been to a class or program on prevention of alcohol and other drug abuse in the past month and 50.7% had heard, read, or watched an advertisement about prevention of substance use in the past year. Qualitative results Eight overarching themes, each with its own sub-themes, emerged from the participant's responses during the focus groups. Each is described below with representative quotes provided throughout for illustrative purposes.Conclusions:Findings revealed several gaps in resources identified by adolescents and young adults that are needed to adequately address substance use, which provide important next steps for substance use prevention among youth.

J	Lun, Xiangmin; Yu, Zhenglin; Chen, Tao; Wang, Fang; Hou, Yimin								A Simplified CNN Classification Method for MI-EEG via the Electrode Pairs Signals								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						338	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00338			SEP 15 2020	2020	A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can provide independent information exchange and control channels for the brain and the outside world. However, EEG signals come from multiple electrodes, the data of which can generate multiple features. How to select electrodes and features to improve classification performance has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with separated temporal and spatial filters, which selects the raw EEG signals of the electrode pairs over the motor cortex region as hybrid samples without any preprocessing or artificial feature extraction operations. In the proposed structure, a 5-layer CNN has been applied to learn EEG features, a 4-layer max pooling has been used to reduce dimensionality, and a fully-connected (FC) layer has been utilized for classification. Dropout and batch normalization are also employed to reduce the risk of overfitting. In the experiment, the 4 s EEG data of 10, 20, 60, and 100 subjects from the Physionet database are used as the data source, and the motor imaginations (MI) tasks are divided into four types: left fist, right fist, both fists, and both feet. The results indicate that the global averaged accuracy on group-level classification can reach 97.28%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve stands out at 0.997, and the electrode pair with the highest accuracy on 10 subjects dataset is FC3-FC4, with 98.61%. The research results also show that this CNN classification method with minimal (2) electrode can obtain high accuracy, which is an advantage over other methods on the same database. This proposed approach provides a new idea for simplifying the design of BCI systems, and accelerates the process of clinical application.

Influence of Regular Musical or Theater Practice in Adults and in the Elderly								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						557642	10.3389/fnhum.2020.557642			SEP 15 2020	2020	The effects of musical practice on cognition are well established yet rarely compared with other kinds of artistic training or expertise. This study aims to compare the possible effect of musical and theater regular practice on cognition across the lifespan. Both of these artistic activities require many hours of individual or collective training in order to reach an advanced level. This process requires the interaction between higher-order cognitive functions and several sensory modalities (auditory, verbal, visual and motor), as well as regular learning of new pieces. This study included participants with musical or theater practice, and healthy controls matched for age (18-84 years old) and education. The objective was to determine whether specific practice in these activities had an effect on cognition across the lifespan, and a protective influence against undesirable cognitive outcomes associated with aging. All participants underwent a battery of cognitive tasks that evaluated processing speed, executive function, fluency, working memory, verbal and visual long-term memories, and non-verbal reasoning abilities. Results showed that music and theater artistic practices were strongly associated with cognitive enhancements. Participants with musical practice were better in executive functioning, working memory and non-verbal reasoning, whereas participants with regular acting practice had better long-term verbal memory and fluency performance. Thus, taken together, results suggest a differential effect of these artistic practices on cognition across the lifespan. Advanced age did not seem to reduce the benefit, so future studies should focus on the hypothetical protective effects of artistic practice against cognitive decline.

Brain Vital Signs Detect Information Processing Differences When Neuromodulation Is Used During Cognitive Skills Training								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						358	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00358			SEP 14 2020	2020	Background: Neuromodulation through translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) has been shown to initiate long-lasting processes of neuronal reorganization with a variety of outcomes (i.e., neuroplasticity). Non-invasive TLNS is increasingly accessible through the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS(R)), a medical device that delivers electrical stimulation to the tongue to activate the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) cranial nerves. Anecdotal reports from previous clinical studies have suggested incidental improvements in cognitive function. To objectively explore this observation, we examined TLNS-related effects on the semantic N400 brain vital sign cognitive response during cognitive skills training in healthy individuals. Methods: Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomized to receive simultaneous TLNS (treatment) or no TLNS (control) while undergoing cognitive skills training. Cognitive training was conducted for two 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon/evening) over 3 consecutive days. Brain vital signs were evaluated at baseline, Day 1, and Day 3. Analyses focused on cognitive processing as measured by N400 changes in amplitude and latency. Results: Over the 3-day course of cognitive training, the N400 amplitude decreased significantly in the control group due to habituation (p= 0.028). In contrast, there was no significant change in the TLNS treatment group. Conclusion: TLNS led to a sustained N400 response during cognitive skills training, as measured by the brain's vital signs framework. The study findings suggest differential learning effects due to neuromodulation, consistent with increased attention and cognitive vigilance.

Following participation in the storytelling workshops, each storyteller was interviewed twice, with three shorter interviews conducted with one participant with significant communication challenges. In total, 25 interview transcripts (17 interviews plus eight transcripts of produced personal narratives) were analysed using constructivist grounded theory methods. Data analysis produced two main themes and sub-themes; (1) Sharing and helping (feeling heard & releasing emotions) and, (2) Re-visiting my story (reflecting and learning). The themes capture insights into the process of storytelling and reveal the therapeutic potential of narrative storytelling when coupled with an altruistic opportunity to help others through story sharing. This study contributes to an emerging area of research and practice supporting positive identity growth following ABI. The findings present substantial implications for goal setting and meaningful productive engagement in brain injury rehabilitation.

Both conditions resulted in modestly improved emotional status. The INT condition led to more exposure to environmental reward and greater productivity. Gains in both conditions were of questionable clinical significance but suggested different mechanisms of action, which should be confirmed by further research. The delivery of frequent text messages proved to be a very feasible means of supporting treatment in this population.

Fifty sub-acute stroke survivors (AgeM = 70.30SD = 15.80, 56% female) and their occupational therapist independently completed three measures assessing activity limitations (cognitive, physical, instrumental) and participation restrictions. Assessments were made of current functioning and predicted functioning at three months' post-discharge. Compared to physical functioning, appraisal discrepancies were more pronounced for cognitive functioning, instrumental activity limitation, and participation restriction. Discrepancies were more pronounced for current, as opposed to predicted, cognitive functioning (Z = -4.21,p < .001) and instrumental activity limitation (Z = -4.00,p < .001). Conversely, discrepancies in participation restriction were greatest for predicted functioning (Z = -4.03,p < .001). Follow-up (n = 39) showed that, compared to survivors' predictions, clinicians' predictions were more closely aligned with actual stroke survivor functioning at three months' post-discharge (as rated by a close other). These findings suggest appraisal discrepancy varies across disability domains and time reference points, with cognitive and complex functional activities being particularly discrepant between stroke survivors and clinicians. Furthermore, clinicians may hold more realistic expectations of short-term functional recovery.

Despite widespread knowledge and acceptance of these consequences many individuals continue to drink excessively. Lack of regret for these consequences may partially explain this.Objectives:To examine the prevalence of regrettable experiences and their role in future intentions to drink.Methods:In two studies (Study 1: cross-sectional; Study 2: longitudinal) participants reported on 18 regrettable experiences; from common regrets (e.g. hangover), to risky behaviors (e.g. drug taking), and serious regrets (e.g. driving under the influence), over a two-week period.Results:Prevalence of regrettable experiences was high (e.g. 79.0% of individuals in study 1 and 66.9% of individuals in study 2 experienced a hangover). Prevalence was greater for common regrets compared to risky behaviors and serious regrets. In study one, alcohol consumed over the previous fortnight predicted the number of different regrettable experiences over the same period. In study two, units consumed on a day-to-day basis predicted the number of regrets on that same basis. Neither study demonstrated evidence for the predictive utility of regrets for intentions to consume alcohol in the future.Conclusions:These findings suggest high prevalence of regrettable experiences, that are predicted by increased alcohol consumption. However, there was little evidence that increased number of experiences predicted future drinking intentions. Regrettable experiences are prevalent following consumption, however a focus on these regrets to deter future alcohol consumption may not be an effective psychological intervention.

All participants completed measures of college alcohol beliefs, alcohol PBS use, hazardous drinking, and alcohol-related negative consequences through an online survey.Results:Higher college alcohol beliefs were associated with greater hazardous drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences. Further, PBS-MOD mediated the positive relationship college alcohol beliefs had with hazardous drinking, such that higher college alcohol beliefs predicted less PBS-MOD use which was associated with greater hazardous drinking.Discussion:These findings provide further evidence to support previous findings highlighting the additional protective value of certain alcohol PBS especially for college students with high college alcohol beliefs.

Sex Differences in Neural Responses to the Perception of Social Interactions								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						565132	10.3389/fnhum.2020.565132			SEP 11 2020	2020	Social interaction is critical to emotional well-being. Previous studies have suggested sex differences in the perception of social interaction. However, the findings depend on the nature of interactions and whether it involves facial emotions. Here, we explored sex differences in neural responses to the perception of social interaction using the Human Connectome Project data. Participants (n= 969, 505 women) were engaged in a social cognition task with geometric objects moving and colliding to simulate social interaction. Behaviorally, men relative to women demonstrated higher accuracy in perceiving social vs. random interactions. Men vs. women showed higher activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and women vs. men showed higher activation in the right inferior frontal cortex, during exposure to social vs. random interactions. In whole-brain regressions, the differences in accuracy rate in identifying social vs. random interactions (AR(SOC)- AR(RAN)) were associated with higher activation in the paracentral lobule (PCL) and lower activation in bilateral anterior insula (AI), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in men and women combined, lower activation in bilateral AI, preSMA and left MFG in men alone, and higher activation in the PCL and the medial orbitofrontal cortex in women alone. The latter sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. Further, the PCL activity mediated the correlation between an internalizing syndromal score, as assessed by the Achenbach Self-Report, and (AR(SOC)- AR(RAN)) across all subjects. These findings highlighted sex differences in the behavioral and neural processes underlying the perception of social interaction, as well as the influence of internalizing traits on these processes.

We applied a deblocking method involved in stimulation-facilitation therapy to six participants with chronic aphasia who performed naming and sentence production tasks for impaired modalities, immediately after a spoken-word picture-matching task for an intact modality. The participants took part in two conditional sessions: a tDCS condition in which they performed a spoken word-picture matching task while we delivered an anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex; and a sham condition in which sham stimulation was delivered. We hypothesized that, compared with the sham stimulation, the application of anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex during the performance of tasks requiring access to semantic representations would enhance the deblocking effect, thereby improving the performances for subsequent naming and sentence production. Our results showed greater improvements 2 weeks after training with tDCS than those after training with sham stimulation. The accuracy rate of naming was significantly higher in the tDCS condition than in the sham condition, regardless of whether the words were trained or not. Also, we found a significant improvement in the production of related words and sentences for the untrained words in the tDCS condition, compared with that found pre-training, while in the sham condition we found no significant improvement compared with that found pre-training. These results support our hypothesis and suggest the effectiveness of the use of tDCS during language training on non-consecutive days.

A Theoretical Framework for How We Learn Aesthetic Values								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						345	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00345			SEP 11 2020	2020	How do we come to like the things that we do? Each one of us starts from a relatively similar state at birth, yet we end up with vastly different sets of aesthetic preferences. These preferences go on to define us both as individuals and as members of our cultures. Therefore, it is important to understand how aesthetic preferences form over our lifetimes. This poses a challenging problem: to understand this process, one must account for the many factors at play in the formation of aesthetic values and how these factors influence each other over time. A general framework based on basic neuroscientific principles that can also account for this process is needed. Here, we present such a framework and illustrate it through a model that accounts for the trajectories of aesthetic values over time. Our framework is inspired by meta-analytic data of neuroimaging studies of aesthetic appraisal. This framework incorporates effects of sensory inputs, rewards, and motivational states. Crucially, each one of these effects is probabilistic. We model their interactions under a reinforcement-learning circuitry. Simulations of this model and mathematical analysis of the framework lead to three main findings. First, different people may develop distinct weighing of aesthetic variables because of individual variability in motivation. Second, individuals from different cultures and environments may develop different aesthetic values because of unique sensory inputs and social rewards. Third, because learning is stochastic, stemming from probabilistic sensory inputs, motivations, and rewards, aesthetic values vary in time. These three theoretical findings account for different lines of empirical research. Through our study, we hope to provide a general and unifying framework for understanding the various aspects involved in the formation of aesthetic values over time.

Factors Associated with Gabapentin Misuse among People Who Inject Drugs in Appalachian Kentucky								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	14			2364	2370		10.1080/10826084.2020.1817082			SEP 11 2020	2020	Aims Gabapentin is misused to potentiate the euphoric effects of opioids, self-treat physical pain, and moderate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Because examinations of gabapentin misuse among people who inject drugs (PWID) are scant, the aim of this study is to identify factors associated with gabapentin misuse among this population.Methods:Data are drawn from a study examining the uptake of syringe service programs (SSPs) in Appalachian Kentucky. The sample includes 324 PWID who were age 18 and over and reported past month drug injection. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine recent (past 90 days) gabapentin misuse.Results: Participants are female (50.0%); Hispanic (2.2%), Black (1.5%), white (90.7%), and other race/ethnicity (4.6%). Mean age is 37. Participants reporting gabapentin misuse had higher odds of reporting (mis)use of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, prescription stimulants, fentanyl, and buprenorphine (p< .042); severe substance use disorder (p< .000); and recent physical pain (p< .003). In multivariable models, findings related to misuse of prescription opioids and buprenorphine; severe substance use disorder; and recent physical pain or discomfort, remained significant (p< .042).Conclusions:This is one of the first studies to examine gabapentin misuse among PWID. It is possible that individuals reporting recent gabapentin misuse are attempting to self-treat physical pain when healthcare is limited. Gabapentin may also be misused to achieve desired central nervous system effects and to potentiate opioid highs. Syringe service programs can educate PWID about the potential dangers of polydrug use involving gabapentin and to connect PWID with needed healthcare services.

Discrepancies in Local, State, and National Alcohol Outlet Listings: Implications for Research and Interventions								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	14			2348	2356		10.1080/10826084.2020.1817080			SEP 11 2020	2020	Background The availability of local, state, and national data on alcohol outlet density have important implications for policies and interventions aiming to reduce alcohol-related problems. High-quality data on locations of alcohol outlets is important to accurately inform community interventions and public health initiatives, but such data is often not maintained, readily available, or of sufficient quality.Objectives: This study aims to examine the discrepancies between alcohol outlet databases and how neighborhood characteristics (i.e. income, majority racial population, urbanicity) are associated with the discrepancies between databases.Methods: Data was collected from national (n = 1), local (n = 2), and state databases (n = 3). Negative binomial regression models were used to assess discrepancies in alcohol outlet count at the ZIP code level based on the data source.Results: The average density of alcohol outlets (per 1000 residents) ranged from 0.71 to 2.17 in Maryland, 1.65 to 5.17 in Wisconsin, and 1.09 to 1.22 in Oregon based on different sources of data. Findings suggest high income areas (>200% poverty level) have fewer discrepancies (IR = 0.775,p < 0.01), low income areas (below poverty level) have greater discrepancies (IR = 4.990,p < 0.01), and urban areas tend to have fewer discrepancies (IR = 0.378,p < 0.01) between datasets.Conclusion: Interventions and policies depend on valid and reliable data; researchers, policymakers, and local agencies need to collaborate to develop methods to maintain accurate and accessible data.

Tracking Changes in Frontal Lobe Hemodynamic Response in Individual Adults With Developmental Language Disorder Following HD tDCS Enhanced Phonological Working Memory Training: An fNIRS Feasibility Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						362	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00362			SEP 10 2020	2020	Background:Current research suggests a neurobiological marker of developmental language disorder (DLD) in adolescents and young adults may be an atypical neural profile coupled with behavioral performance that overlaps with that of normal controls. Although many imaging techniques are not suitable for the study of speech and language processing in DLD populations, fNIRS may be a viable option. In this study we asked if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical cortical activation patterns in individual adults with DLD and track potential changes in cortical activation patterns following a phonological working memory training protocol enhanced with anodal HD tDCS stimulation to the presupplementary motor area (preSMA). Objective/Hypothesis:The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine if fNIRS can be used to identify atypical hemodynamic responses in individual young adults with DLD during active spoken word processing and, (2) to determine if fNIRS can detect changes in hemodynamic response in these same adults with DLD following anodal HD tDCS enhanced phonological working memory training. Methods:Two adult subjects with DLD (female, age 25) completed a total of two sessions of fNIRs working memory task prior to and following one session of a non-word repetition task paired with anodal HD tDCS (1.0 mA tDCS; 20 min) to the preSMA. Standardizedz-scores of behavioral measures (accuracy and reaction time) and changes in hemodynamic response during an n-back working memory task for the two participants with DLD was compared to that of a normative sample of 21 age- and gender- matched normal controls (ages 18 to 25) prior to and following phonological working memory training. Results:Individual standardizedz-scores for each participant with DLD indicated that prior to training, hemoglobin response in the prefrontal lobe for both participants was markedly different from each other and normal controls. Following training, standard scores showed that the hemodynamic response for both participants moved within normal limits for ROIs. Conclusion:These findings highlight the feasibility of fNIRS to establish individual differences in the link between behavior and neural patterns in single subjects with DLD, as well as track individual differences in changes in brain activity following working memory training.

Brain Vital Signs Detect Cognitive Improvements During Combined Physical Therapy and Neuromodulation in Rehabilitation From Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						347	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00347			SEP 10 2020	2020	Using a longitudinal case study design, we have tracked the recovery of motor function following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal neuroimaging approach. In 2006, Canadian Soldier Captain (retired) Trevor Greene (TG) was attacked with an axe to the head while on tour in Afghanistan. TG continues intensive daily rehabilitation, which recently included the integration of physical therapy (PT) with neuromodulation using translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) to facilitate neuroplasticity. Recent findings with PT + TLNS demonstrated that recovery of motor function occurred beyond conventional time limits, currently extending past 14-years post-injury. To investigate whether PT + TLNS similarly resulted in associated cognitive function improvements, we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) with the brain vital signs framework. In parallel with motor function improvements, brain vital signs detected significant increases in basic attention (as measured by P300 response amplitude) and cognitive processing (as measured by contextual N400 response amplitude). These objective cognitive improvements corresponded with TG's self-reported improvements, including a noteworthy and consistent reduction in ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The findings provide valuable insight into the potential importance of non-invasive neuromodulation in cognitive rehabilitation, in addition to initial indications for physical rehabilitation.

However, team coordination is highly variable, which is one reason why its underlying neural processes are largely unknown. Here we used dual electroencephalography (EEG) in dyads to study the neurobehavioral dynamics of team coordination in an ecologically valid task that places intensive demands on joint performance. We present a novel conceptual framework to interpret neurobehavioral variability in terms ofdegeneracy, a fundamental property of complex biological systems said to enhance flexibility and robustness. We characterize degeneracy conceptually in terms of a manifold representing the geometric locus of the dynamics in the high dimensional state-space of neurobehavioral signals. The geometry and dimensionality of the manifold are determined by task constraints and team coordination requirements which restrict the manifold to trajectories that are conducive to successful task performance. Our results indicate that team coordination is associated with dimensionality reduction of the manifold as evident in increased inter-brain phase coherence of beta and gamma rhythms during critical phases of task performance where subjects exchange information. Team coordination was also found to affect the shape of the manifold manifested as a symmetry breaking of centro-parietal wavelet power patterns across subjects in trials with high team coordination. These results open a conceptual and empirical path to identifying the mechanisms underlying team performance in complex tasks.		[Dodel, Silke; Tognoli, Emmanuelle; Kelso, J. A.

Using non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation for neglect and associated attentional deficits following stroke								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	5			732	763		10.1080/09602011.2020.1805335			MAY 28 2022	2022	Neglect is a disabling neuropsychological syndrome that is frequently observed following right-hemispheric stroke. Affected individuals often present with multiple attentional deficits, ranging from reduced orienting towards contralesional space to a generalized impairment in maintaining attention over time. Although a degree of spontaneous recovery occurs in most patients, in some individuals this condition can be treatment-resistant with prominent ongoing non-spatial deficits. Further, there is a large inter-individual variability in response to different therapeutic approaches. Given its potential to alter neuronal excitability and affect neuroplasticity, non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising tool that could potentially be utilized to facilitate recovery. However, there are many outstanding questions regarding its implementation in this heterogeneous patient group. Here we provide a critical overview of the available evidence on the use of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation, focussing on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), to improve neglect and associated attentional deficits after right-hemispheric stroke. At present, there is insufficient robust evidence supporting the clinical use of tDCS to alleviate symptoms of neglect. Future research would benefit from careful study design, enhanced precision of electrical montages, multi-modal approaches exploring predictors of response, tailored dose-control applications and increased efforts to evaluate standalone tDCS versus its incorporation into combination therapy.

This fMRI study examined the independent and combined effects of two cardiovascular risk factors, arterial plasticity, and physical fitness, on brain activations during task-switching in older adults. The effects of these two risk factors on age-related differences in activation between older and younger adults were also examined. Independently, low physical fitness and low arterial plasticity were related to reduced suppressions of occipital brain regions. The combined effects of these two risks on occipital regions were greater than the independent effects of either risk factor. Age-related overactivations in frontal cortex were observed in low fitness older adults. Brain-behavior correlation indicates that these frontal overactivations are maladaptive to older adults' task performance. It is possible that the resulting effects of cardiovascular risks on the aging brain, especially the maladaptive overactivations of frontal brain regions by high risk older adults, contribute to often found posterior-anterior shift in aging (PASA) brain activations. Furthermore, observed age-related differences in brain activations during task-switching can be partially attributed to individual differences in cardiovascular risks among older adults.

J	Solf, Benjamin; Schramm, Stefan; Blum, Maren-Christina; Klee, Sascha								The Influence of the Stimulus Design on the Harmonic Components of the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						343	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00343			SEP 9 2020	2020	Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) are commonly used for functional objective diagnostics. In general, the main response at the stimulation frequency is used. However, some studies reported the main response at the second harmonic of the stimulation frequency. The aim of our study was to analyze the influence of the stimulus design on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. We studied 22 subjects (8 males, mean age +/- SD = 27 +/- 4.8 years) using a circular layout (r(1)= 0-1.6 degrees,r(2)= 1.6-3.5 degrees,r(3)= 3.5-6.4 degrees,r(4)= 6.4-10.9 degrees, andr(5)= 10.9-18 degrees). At a given eccentricity, the stimulus was presented according to a 7.5 Hz square wave with 50% duty cycle. To analyze the influence of the stimulus eccentricity, a background luminance of 30 cd/m(2)was added to suppress foveal stray light effects; to analyze the influence of simultaneous foveal and peripheral stimulations, stimulations are performed without stray light suppression. For statistical analysis, mediansMof the amplitude ratios for amplitudes at the second harmonic to the first harmonic and the probability of the occurrence of the main response at the second harmonicP(MCSH)are calculated. For stimulations with foveal stray light suppression, the medians wereM(0-1.6<^>circle)= 0.45,M1.6-3.5<^>circle= 0.45,M3.5-6.4<^>circle= 0.76,M6.4-10.9<^>circle= 0.72, andM(10.9-18<^>circle)= 0.48, and the probabilities wereP(0-1.6<^>circle)(MCSH)= 0.05,P1.6-3.5<^>circle(MCSH)= 0.05,P3.5-6.4<^>circle(MCSH)= 0.32,P6.4-10.9<^>circle(MCSH)= 0.29, andP(10.9-18<^>circle)(MCSH)= 0.30. For stimulations without foveal stray light suppression, the mediansMwereM(0-1.6<^>circle)= 0.29,M1.6-3.5<^>circle= 0.37,M3.5-6.4<^>circle= 0.98,M6.4-10.9<^><^>circle= 1.08, andM(10.9-18<^>circle)= 1.24, and the probabilities wereP(0-1.6<^>circle)(MCSH)= 0.09,P1.6-3.5<^>circle(MCSH)= 0.05,P3.5-6.4<^>circle(MCSH)= 0.50,P6.4-10.9<^>circle(MCSH)= 0.55, andP(10.9-18<^>circle)(MCSH)= 0.55. In conclusion, the stimulus design has an influence on the harmonic components of ssVEPs. An increase in stimulation eccentricity during extrafoveal stimulation leads to a transition of the main response to the second harmonic. The effect is enhanced by a simultaneous foveal stimulation.

Almost 38 percent of school districts currently implement student drug testing, and more schools may be considering implementation due to emerging recreational drug use laws. Parents are an essential key stakeholder and decision-maker in school policies.Purpose:The purpose of this study was to examine Colorado parents' perceptions regarding high school drug testing.Methods:A cross-sectional research design was used to assess parental support for implementing drug testing in public high schools. A total of 205 participants completed a survey evaluating support, attitude, and beliefs regarding this policy. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the data.Results:The majority of parents perceived that alcohol (68.3%), cannabis (77.6%), and illicit drugs (51.2%) were a problem amongst students at their child's high school. Parents overall were supportive of drug testing students (61.9%), except for parents who were current cannabis users (p= .002). The majority of parents are supportive of drug testing because they believe it could help students resist peer pressure (65.9%), facilitate early intervention (e.g. counseling; 71.2%), while not violating student privacy rights (57.6%) or creating a negative school climate (50.7%).Conclusions/Importance:Parents recognize there may be an adolescent drug use problem. Parental support of drug testing is an important consideration for superintendents/school districts who are contemplating implementation of a drug testing policy for high schools.

However, results from previous studies are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be attributed to methodological and individual differences during experiments. This study therefore investigated two hypotheses: (1) A multichannel-optimized montage was expected to be more effective than a classical bipolar montage, because of increased focality. (2) The subjects were expected to benefit differently from the stimulation depending on their initial task performance. In a sham-controlled crossover study, 24 healthy participants received bipolar, multichannel, and sham stimulation for 20 min in randomized order, targeting the lDLPFC while performing a 2-back WM task. After stimulation, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded at rest and during 2-back and nontarget continuous performance task (CPT) performance. Bipolar and multichannel stimulations were both well tolerated and effectively blinded. We found no effect of stimulation on behavioral performance or neuronal oscillations comparing the classical bipolar or multichannel montage with sham stimulation. We did, however, find an interaction between stimulation and initial task performance. For multichannel stimulation, initially low-performing participants tended to improve their WM performance while initially high-performing participants tended to worsen their performance compared to sham stimulation. Both tDCS montages induced changes in neural oscillatory power, which correlated with baseline performance. The worse the participants' initial WM performance was, the more task-related theta power was induced by multichannel and bipolar stimulation. The same effect was observed for alpha power in the nontarget task following multichannel stimulation. Notably, we were not able to show a superiority of multichannel stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. Still, comparing both montages with sham stimulation, multichannel stimulation led to stronger effects than bipolar stimulation. The current study highlights the importance of investigating different parameters with potential influence on tDCS effects in combination. Our results demonstrate how individual differences in cognitive performance and electrode montages influence effects of tDCS on neuropsychological performance. These findings support the idea of an individualized and optimized stimulation setting, potentially leading to increased tDCS effects.

Effects of Nicotine Gum Administration on Vision (ENIGMA-Vis): Study Protocol of a Double-Blind, Randomized, and Controlled Clinical Trial								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						314	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00314			SEP 8 2020	2020	Studies reported that tobacco addiction was related to visual impairments, but one unresolved issue is whether the impairments are related to the many compounds existing in the cigarettes or to the effects of nicotine. On the other hand, nicotine gum can be used as replacement therapy or as a neuroprotective agent for some diseases. The main purpose of this controlled trial is to investigate the effects of nicotine gum on vision. The ENIGMA-Vis trial aims to compare two dosages of nicotine gum (2 and 4 mg) and a placebo gum in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 participants to be allocated into a single group assignment of repeated measures (two studies;N= 50 for each one). Eligibility criteria are healthy non-smokers not diagnosed with substance abuse and without an acute or chronic medical condition. Intervention will last three sessions for each participant with a window frame of 1 week per session. Study outcomes are (1) short-term effects of nicotine gum on contrast sensitivity; (2) short-term effects of nicotine gum on chromatic contrast discrimination; and (3) whether demographics, body mass index, or serum cotinine predicts response of visual processing. This study addresses an important gap in the effects of nicotine on vision. One of the main takeaways of this study is to understand the effects of nicotine on contrast sensitivity and chromatic contrast discrimination. This information will provide a further understanding of how nicotine interacts with early visual processes and help determine how the different components present during smoking can affect vision.

Using Communication to Modulate Neural Synchronization in Teams								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						332	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00332			SEP 8 2020	2020	Throughout training and team performance, teams may be assessed based on their communication patterns to identify which behaviors contributed to the team's performance; however, this process of establishing meaning in communication is burdensome and time consuming despite the low monetary cost. A current topic in team research is developing covert measures, which are easier to analyze in real-time, to identify team processes as they occur during team performance; however, little is known about how overt and covert measures of team process relate to one another. In this study, we investigated the relationship between overt (communication) and covert (neural) measures of team process by manipulating the interaction partner (participant or experimenter) team members worked with and the type of task (decision-making or action-based) teams performed to assess their effects on team neural synchronization (measured as neurodynamic entropy) and communication (measured as both flow and content). The results indicated that the type of task affected how the teams structured their communication but had unpredictable effects on the neural synchronization of the team when averaged across the task session. The interaction partner did not affect team neural synchronization when averaged. However, there were significant relationships when communication and neural processes were examined over time between the neurodynamic entropy and the communication flow time series due to both the type of task and the interaction partner. Specifically, significant relationships across time were observed when participants were interacting with the other participant, during the second task trial, and across different regions of the cortex depending on the type of task being performed. The findings from the time series analyses suggest that factors that are previously known to affect communication (interaction partner and task type) also structure the relationship between team communication and neural synchronization-cross-level effects-but only when examined across time. Future research should consider these factors when developing new conceptualizations of team process measurement for measuring team performance over time.

The self-medication theory suggests coping as the potential link between substance use and psychological distress, and it has been found that ineffective coping styles are related to increased PTSD symptom severity and harmful drinking behaviors.Purpose:This study evaluated the mediating role of coping styles (i.e. problem-solving and avoidance coping) on the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and alcohol outcomes (i.e. hazardous drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences [ARNC]).Methods:A national sample of 672 traditional age (i.e. 18-25 years old;M = 22.35,SD = 1.97) college students who reported alcohol consumption in the past month were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk website. Participants were 55.1% male and 60.9% White and completed measures of PTSD symptoms, coping styles, hazardous drinking, and ARNC.Results:Problem-solving coping mediated the positive relationship between PTSD symptoms and hazardous drinking such that PTSD symptoms were negatively associated with problem-solving coping, which was negatively associated with hazardous drinking. Avoidance coping mediated the positive relationship between PTSD symptoms and ARNC through a positive association between PTSD symptoms and avoidance coping.Conclusions:These novel findings highlight the importance of adaptive coping styles as a protective factor for college students experiencing co-occurring PTSD symptoms and harmful alcohol use.

We also computed sensory-level activity using EEG data and investigated theta and alpha neural oscillations, phase-locking values (PLV), and brain networks. Based on the scores from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), an ADHD-trait group (n= 40) and a normal control group (n= 41) were selected. Participants were required to respond to whether the presented stimulus was at the same location as that presented two trials earlier. The ADHD-trait group showed significantly slower response times than the control group in the spatial 2-back task. In terms of spectrum, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly reduced theta power than the control group. In contrast, the ADHD-trait group exhibited an increased alpha power compared to the control group with the 250-1000 ms interval after stimulus onset. In terms of the PLV, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly weaker theta phase synchrony and fewer connection numbers in frontal-occipital areas than the control group. In terms of the theta brain network, the ADHD-trait group showed a significantly lower clustering coefficient and longer characteristic path length than the control group for the theta band. The present results indicate that college students with ADHD traits have deficits in spatial working memory and that these abnormal activities in neural oscillation, functional connectivity, and the network may contribute to spatial working memory deficits.

Alcohol harm-reduction programs that include protective behavioral strategies (PBSs) provide a promising approach to curb drinking among students, yet results have been inconsistent among high-risk drinkers.Purpose:To evaluate the impact of a harm-reduction, peer-led training program called "Voice of Reason" (VOR) on alcohol knowledge and behaviors among students in Greek chapters.Methods:We conducted two studies with students directly trained in VOR (Study 1: N = 118; Study 2: N = 53) and with students in affiliated Greek chapters (Study 1: N = 1363; Study 2: N = 1446). Study 1 included 13 chapters and Study 2 included 15 chapters.Results:Results of analyses across both studies showed that among those directly trained in VOR, there were pre-post increases in alcohol knowledge, medical amnesty law awareness, talking with friends about PBS, use of PBS, and intentions to use PBS, as well as pre-post decreases in drinking and driving and riding with drinking drivers. In addition, VOR had an impact on students in affiliated chapters, indicating an increase in medical amnesty law awareness and a decrease in the number of drinks consumed on a typical day.Conclusions:Overall, results provide some early evidence of VOR impact, while also demonstrating the challenge of changing normative drinking behaviors among high-risk college students. Ongoing research is needed to assess the effectiveness of VOR, especially after successive implementations with the same chapters.

Sixteen subjects completed an MI task playing the piano with both hands, and neurophysiological assessment was performed during the MI task. The Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised was adopted to evaluate MI ability, while the visual analogue scale (VAS) was adopted to evaluate MI quality. A TMS pulse was delivered during the MI task, and MEPs were subsequently recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB). We found a significant positive correlation between the VAS score and the TMS-induced MEPs (rho= 0.497,p< 0.001). These findings suggest that the VAS score could potentially reflect the corticospinal excitability during MI + AO, particularly in complex MI tasks.

However, our knowledge regarding these trajectories and their associations is still limited due to small sample sizes and low numbers of repeated measures. For the present study, we used a large longitudinal dataset (four measurements over 4 years) comprising anatomical data from a sample of healthy older adults (N= 231 at baseline). This dataset enables us to gain new insights about volumetric cortical and subcortical changes and their associations in the context of healthy aging. Brain structure volumes were derived from T1-weighted MRI scans using FreeSurfer segmentation tools. Brain structure trajectories were fitted using mixed models and latent growth curve models to gain information about the mean extent and variability of decline trajectories for different brain structures as well as the associations between individual trajectories. On the group level, our analyses indicate similar linear changes for frontal and parietal brain regions, while medial temporal regions showed an accelerated decline with advancing age. Regarding subcortical regions, some structures showed strong declines (e.g., hippocampus), others showed little decline (e.g., pallidum). Our data provide little evidence for sex differences regarding the aforementioned trajectories. Between-person variability of the person-specific slopes (random slopes) was largest in subcortical and medial temporal brain structures. When looking at the associations between the random slopes from each brain structure, we found that the decline is largely homogenous across the majority of cortical brain structures. In subcortical and medial temporal brain structures, however, more heterogeneity of the decline was observed, meaning that the extent of the decline in one structure is less predictive of the decline in another structure. Taken together, our study contributes to enhancing our understanding of structural brain aging by demonstrating (1) that average volumetric change differs across the brain and (2) that there are regional differences with respect to between-person variability in the slopes. Moreover, our data suggest (3) that random slopes are highly correlated across large parts of the cerebral cortex but (4) that some brain regions (i.e., medial temporal regions) deviate from this homogeneity.

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural responses to romantic rejection and acceptance in 36 healthy men and women, ages 18-53 years. Activations during rejection showed extensive anatomical overlap with activations during acceptance in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and anterior insula (AI). In an analysis of sex differences, men and women did not differ in behavioral responses; however, men showed greater activation to romantic rejection and acceptance in the left vlPFC and AI compared to women. The vlPFC and AI may play a role in social cognition, tuned to detect the intentions and feelings of others whether they are positive or negative. In the context of romantic rejection and acceptance, this activation may signal the intent of others who are desired by the individual, leading to changes in mood, self-esteem, and social motivation.

This hypothesis can be extended into the social domain: perception of other minds is constituted by mastery of self-other contingencies, that is, by the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in others' movements depend on changes in one's movements. We investigated this proposal using the perceptual crossing paradigm, in which pairs of players are required to locate each other in an invisible one-dimensional virtual space by using a minimal haptic interface. We recorded and analyzed the real-time embodied social interaction of 10 pairs of adult participants. The results reveal a process of implicit perceptual learning: on average, clarity of perceiving the other's presence increased over trials and then stabilized. However, a clearer perception of the other was not associated with correctness of recognition as such, but with both players correctly recognizing each other. Furthermore, the moments of correct mutual recognition tended to happen within seconds. The fact that changes in social experience can only be explained by the successful performance at the level of the dyad, and that this veridical mutual perception tends toward synchronization, lead us to hypothesize that integration of neural activity across both players played a role.

However, while there have been studies on regional brain structural alterations, only few studies have focused on the topological organization of the brain structural covariance network. This work aimed to describe the structural covariance network architecture alterations that are possibly linked to cortex reorganization in patients with CSM. Methods High-resolution anatomical images of 31 CSM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. The images were acquired using a sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted BRAVO sequence. Firstly, the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions of automated anatomical labeling atlas were computed using a VBM toolbox based on the DARTEL algorithm. Then, the brain structural covariance network was constructed by thresholding the gray matter volume correlation matrices. Subsequently, the network measures and nodal property were calculated based on graph theory. Finally, the differences in the network metrics and nodal property between groups were compared using a non-parametric test. Results Patients with CSM showed larger global efficiency and smaller local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and sigma values than HCs. Patients with CSM had greater betweenness in the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L) and the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) than HCs. Besides, patients with CSM had smaller betweenness in right middle occipital gyrus. The brain structural covariance networks of CSM patients exhibited equal resilience to random failure as those of HCs. However, the maximum relative size of giant connected components was approximately 10% larger in HCs than in CSM patients, upon removal of 44 nodes in targeted attack. Conclusion These observed alternations in global network measures in CSM patients reflect that the brain structural covariance network in CSM exhibits the less optimal small-world model compared to that in HCs. Increased betweenness in SPG.L and SMA.L seems to be related to cortex reorganization to recover multiple sensory functions after spinal cord injury in CSM patients. The network resilience of patients with CSM exhibiting a relative mild vulnerability, compared to HCs, is probably attributable to the balance and interplay between cortex reorganization and ongoing degeneration.

However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences is not yet understood. In the present study, we used a closed-loop electroencephalography-tACS(EEG-tACS) protocol to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened, EO) but not high (eyes closed, EC). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtainedviathe estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between the tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulatedviaclosed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject-specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.

Factors predicting rehabilitation outcomes after severe acquired brain injury in trauma, stroke and anoxia populations: A cohort study								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	2			179	210		10.1080/09602011.2020.1810077			FEB 7 2022	2022	Severe acquired brain injury has long-term physical and cognitive effects. Identifying patient variables predictive of recovery in different brain injury populations would generate improved prognostic information and help rehabilitation teams set appropriate therapeutic goals. This cohort study of 447 NHS neurorehabilitation inpatients aimed to identify functional and cognitive predictors of recovery following severe acquired brain injury caused by trauma, stroke and anoxia. Motor and cognitive impairment ratings were collected at admission and discharge using the Functional Independence Measure and Functional Assessment Measure (FIM+FAM), and injury-related and demographic data were collated from medical records. Predictors of physical, cognitive and overall recovery were identified via hierarchical regression analyses. Several key findings emerged. Firstly, on-admission motor skills predicted functional and overall outcomes across groups. Secondly, on-admission social interaction skills predicted cognitive discharge outcomes in stroke and trauma, and overall outcomes for stroke, but did not predict anoxia outcomes. Thirdly, age predicted all forms of recovery for stroke only. Further group-specific factors were also identified as predicting motor and cognitive recovery, indicating that factors key to the rehabilitation trajectory may differ between populations. These variables should be considered in rehabilitation goal planning, although further research is required to explore their contributions to recovery.

The Suppression of Taboo Word Spoonerisms Is Associated With Altered Medial Frontal Negativity: An ERP Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						368	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00368			SEP 4 2020	2020	The constant internal monitoring of speech is a crucial feature to ensure the fairly error-free process of speech production. It has been argued that internal speech monitoring takes place through detection of conflict between different response options or "speech plans." Speech errors are thought to occur because two (or more) competing speech plans become activated, and the speaker is unable to inhibit the erroneous plan(s) prior to vocalization. A prime example for a speech plan that has to be suppressed is the involuntary utterance of a taboo word. The present study seeks to examine the suppression of involuntary taboo word utterances. We used the "Spoonerisms of Laboratory Induced Predisposition" (SLIP) paradigm to elicit two competing speech plans, one being correct and one embodying either a taboo word or a non-taboo word spoonerism. Behavioral data showed that inadequate speech plans generally were effectively suppressed, although more effectively in the taboo word spoonerism condition. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a broad medial frontal negativity (MFN) after the target word pair presentation, interpreted as reflecting conflict detection and resolution to suppress the inadequate speech plan. The MFN was found to be more pronounced in the taboo word spoonerism compared to the neutral word spoonerism condition, indicative of a higher level of conflict when subjects suppressed the involuntary utterance of taboo words.

Brain Network Modularity Predicts Improvements in Cognitive and Scholastic Performance in Children Involved in a Physical Activity Intervention								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						346	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00346			SEP 3 2020	2020	Introduction: Brain network modularity is a principle that quantifies the degree to which functional brain networks are divided into subnetworks. Higher modularity reflects a greater number of within-module connections and fewer connections between modules, and a highly modular brain is often interpreted as a brain that contains highly specialized brain networks with less integration between networks. Recent work in younger and older adults has demonstrated that individual differences in brain network modularity at baseline can predict improvements in performance after cognitive and physical interventions. The use of brain network modularity as a predictor of training outcomes has not yet been examined in children. Method: In the present study, we examined the relationship between baseline brain network modularity and changes (post-intervention performance minus pre-intervention performance) in cognitive and academic performance in 8- to 9-year-old children who participated in an after-school physical activity intervention for 9 months (N= 78) as well as in children in a wait-list control group (N= 72). Results: In children involved in the after-school physical activity intervention, higher modularity of brain networks at baseline predicted greater improvements in cognitive performance for tasks of executive function, cognitive efficiency, and mathematics achievement. There were no associations between baseline brain network modularity and performance changes in the wait-list control group. Discussion: Our study has implications for biomarkers of cognitive plasticity in children. Understanding predictors of cognitive performance and academic progress during child development may facilitate the effectiveness of interventions aimed to improve cognitive and brain health.

The relative contributions of featural, configural, and holistic processing to decision-making are as yet poorly understood. This study used a diffusion decision model (DDM) of decision-making to investigate the contribution of early face-sensitive processes to emotion recognition from physiognomic features (the eyes, nose, and mouth) by determining how experimental conditions tapping those processes affect early face-sensitive neuroelectric reflections (P100, N170, and P250) of processes determining evidence accumulation at the behavioral level. We first examined the effects of both stimulus orientation (upright vs. inverted) and stimulus type (photographs vs. sketches) on behavior and neuroelectric components (amplitude and latency). Then, we explored the sources of variance common to the experimental effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) and the DDM parameters. Several results suggest that the N170 indicates core visual processing for emotion recognition decision-making: (a) the additive effect of stimulus inversion and impoverishment on N170 latency; and (b) multivariate analysis suggesting that N170 neuroelectric activity must be increased to counteract the detrimental effects of face inversion on drift rate and of stimulus impoverishment on the stimulus encoding component of non-decision times. Overall, our results show that emotion recognition is still possible even with degraded stimulation, but at a neurocognitive cost, reflecting the extent to which our brain struggles to accumulate sensory evidence of a given emotion. Accordingly, we theorize that: (a) the P100 neural generator would provide a holistic frame of reference to the face percept through categorical encoding; (b) the N170 neural generator would maintain the structural cohesiveness of the subtle configural variations in facial expressions across our experimental manipulations through coordinate encoding of the facial features; and (c) building on the previous configural processing, the neurons generating the P250 would be responsible for a normalization process adapting to the facial features to match the stimulus to internal representations of emotional expressions.

All these studies were in controlled laboratory-tasks in which the task designed to induce the studied learning mechanism. Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.		[Haar, Shlomi; Faisal, A.

Children observed one character distributing toys or candies between two recipients. One of the recipients already possessed many resources, and the other possessed just a few. We used event-related potentials to compare brain activity elicited by equitable (the poor receives more) and inequitable (the rich receives more) distribution. On a behavioral level, children evaluated inequitable distribution as worse than equitable and considered the distributor as mean and worthy of punishment when she distributed inequitably as compared to equitably. On the neural level, we expected to find a MFN effect between 250 and 350 ms after picture onset. Instead, we found a frontal positivity (P2), which was greater for inequitable vs. equitable distributions, indicating greater saliency and attentional capture. This was followed by marginally significant greater positivity for equitable distributions between 600 and 1000 ms after picture onset (LPP), which indicates greater allocation of processing resources. Furthermore, a greater LPP was associated with more extreme evaluations for both conditions. This suggests that the more resources children invest in processing the distribution, the more they endorse equity and condemn inequity.

By varying the time interval between target and mask, we manipulated target visibility measured as target discrimination accuracies (ACCs; Experiments 1 and 2) and as subjective awareness ratings (Experiment 3). To modulate stimulus-driven attention capture, we presented the masked target either as a color-singleton (the target stands out by its unique color among homogeneously colored non-singletons), as a non-singleton together with a distractor singleton elsewhere (an irrelevant distractor has a unique color, whereas the target is colored like the other stimuli) or without a singleton (no stimulus stands out; only in Experiment 1). As color singletons capture attention in a stimulus-driven way, we expected target visibility/discrimination performance to be best for target singletons and worst with distractor singletons. In Experiments 1 and 2, we confirmed that the masking interval and the singleton manipulation influenced ACCs in an independent way and that attention capture by the singletons, with facilitated performance in target-singleton compared to distractor-singleton conditions, was found regardless of the interval-induced (in-)visibility of the targets. In Experiment 1, we also confirmed that attention capture was the same among participants with worse and better visibility/discrimination performance. In Experiment 2, we confirmed attention capture by color singletons with better discrimination performance for probes presented at singleton position, compared to other positions. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that attention capture by target singletons also increased target awareness and that this capture effect on subjective awareness was independent of the effect of the masking interval, too. Together, results provide new evidence that stimulus-driven attention and awareness operate independently from one another and that stimulus-driven attention capture can precede awareness.

To investigate the effects of the original reference (REF-CZ), the common average reference (CAR), and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) on scalp EEG functional network analysis during hand movement tasks, EEGs of 17 right-handed subjects performing self-paced hand movements were collected, and scalp functional networks [coherence (COH), phase-locking value (PLV), phase lag index (PLI)] with different references were constructed. Compared with the REF-CZ reference, the networks with CAR and REST references exhibited more significant increases in connectivity during the left-/right-hand movement preparation (MP) and movement execution (ME) stages. The node degree of the channel near the reference electrode was significantly reduced by the REF-CZ reference. CAR and REST both decreased this reference effect, REST more so than CAR. We confirmed that the choice of reference would affect the analysis of the functional network during hand movement tasks, and the REST reference can greatly reduce the effects of the online recording reference on the analysis of EEG connectivity.

The goal of this study was to provide evidence of feasibility and acceptability of the MC approach and to explore clinical outcomes. A case series of eight individuals with acquired brain injury and at least mild executive functioning impairment were recruited from an acute inpatient rehabilitation unit. The MC approach - involving guided questioning and patient self-generation of strategies practiced across everyday functional cognitive tasks - was implemented within routine occupational therapy. Occupational therapists implemented the MC approach with high adherence to the treatment protocol. Therapists' perceived challenges were the time constraints of inpatient rehabilitation as well as client factors. Participants rated the MC approach as highly satisfying and engaging. They described subjective improvements in their ability to use executive functioning strategies. The MC approach was associated with improvement in awareness, strategy use, and executive functioning at the conclusion of treatment. The MC approach may be a beneficial intervention for individuals with acquired brain injury and executive dysfunction undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. Further evaluation with larger samples in controlled trials is warranted.

Each control was matched with a corresponding absconding case on the following order: (a) admission ward, (b) admission period, (c) diagnosis, and (d) age. Results: Among 20,052 adult admissions during the specified period, 38 patients absconded, with a rate of 1.8 per 1,000 admissions. Most of them were male, from a younger age group, diagnosed with schizophrenia or mood disorder, and having comorbid substance use disorder, irritable affect, impaired judgment, and absent insight. Most of the events occurred within the first two weeks of admission. About 11% of them had a history of prior absconding from the hospital. Conclusion: Knowledge about the associated sociodemographic and clinical profile would help clinicians and mental health care professionals to prevent absconding. Further risk assessment using a patient's profile would help to reduce absconding events from psychiatric hospitals in the future.

The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes, knowledge, and barriers to employment as experienced by patients and their caregivers in India. Method: Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, aged between 18 and 60 and undergoing inpatient treatment and their caregivers, were approached for written informed consent and recruited for focus group discussions. A total of eight focus groups were conducted until saturation of themes was seen to have been achieved. The data were transcribed, coded, synthesized, and organized into major findings and implications for practice. Results: Role expectations based on gender were seen to influence the decision to work. The possible recurrence of illness due to excess stress and unsupportive working environments was cited as the most common problem that could arise related to employment. Stigma and faulty attributions related to the illness were the most cited barriers to employment. Most participants felt that psychosocial rehabilitation and family and community support were essential for facilitating work. Most participants did not consider mental illness as a disability and were unaware of government schemes for the mentally ill. Conclusion: Considering gender-based role expectations, avenues for self/family employment and improving the awareness of benefits for mental illness both among consumers and health care professionals are essential to enhance economic productivity in people with severe mental illness.

PSYCHO-ONCOLOGIE				14	3			97	105		10.3166/pson-2020-0130			SEP 2020	2020	Regularly at the heart of political and social debates, the decriminalization of cannabis questions many industrialized countries. Studies assessing the potential risks and benefits of cannabinoids are increasingly numerous but often contradictory. However, in view of the published scientific data, the National Assembly and ANSM have decided to launch experimentation of therapeutic cannabinoids for restricted indications, including oncology. Our goal here is to assess the benefits/risks of medicinal cannabis use in cancer patients. On the one hand, the benefits seem to be multiple. Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, our knowledge of synthetic cannabinoids pharmacology has increased. There is currently scientific evidence of the use of these molecules in chemo-induced nausea and vomiting and chronic pain that is resistant to first-line treatments. However, the imperfect methodology of these studies and the lack of standardization of treatments do not reach a high level of evidence. While in vitro experiments have shown potential antitumor action in cannabinoids, there is no in vivo experimentation other than a case study of relapsed glioblastomas, the small number of which does not allow any conclusions to be drawn. In addition to these benefits, the side effects of cannabinoids, both psychiatric and somatic, should not be overlooked. The incidence of testicular germ cell tumors, especially non-seminomas, is promoted by cannabis use in young men. The risk of developing lung, head, neck, and mouth cancers does not appear to be higher. In conclusion, little high-level scientific evidence is available, but there seems to be an opportunity for selected patients to receive synthetic cannabinoids as a medicine. It is necessary to organize rigorous and standardized scientific research to ensure access to these new drugs outside any political consideration.

During the pandemic of March-May 2020, 17 French nursing homes organized staff confinement periods with residents 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, to reduce the risk of entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into their facilities, in a context where visits to residents were prohibited. By means of a telephone survey of their directors, we observed that 16 nursing homes (94%) had no cases of COVID-19 among the residents, and that mortality from COVID-19 was very low compared to that recorded at the national level by Sante publique France (p<10(-4)). Moreover, the number of cases of Covid-19 among the staff of these nursing homes was also lower than that recorded by Sante publique France (p<10(-4)). These establishments experienced certain difficulties which the directors managed to overcome and the investment of these teams was widely appreciated by the families of the residents and through the press.

In PD, insomnia is associated with a very significant decrease in quality of life and deleterious consequences on both patients and caregivers' health. The main therapeutic option in response to insomnia comorbid to PD is the prescription of benzodiazepines or related drugs. As in the general population, these sedative-hypnotic molecules have very low efficacy in PD and are associated with adverse effects. They are highly addictive and are also associated with drowsiness, risk of falling and decreased life expectancy. These side effects may in themselves be symptoms associated with PD in the absence of insomnia. In this clinical context, we can easily conceive that sedative-hypnotics are likely to potentiate these clinical symptoms in PD. We have recently documented that insomnia disorder comorbid to PD is associated with the classical psychological factors perpetuating insomnia in neurological disease-free individuals with insomnia. These results have allowed us to emphasize that target-oriented interventions for instance cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic insomnia (CBT-i) should be considered as a treatment approach for insomnia disorder comorbid to PD. As a reminder, for decades, CBT-i is considered the most effective first-line treatment for the management of chronic insomnia associated or not with comorbidity. In this context, we demonstrated the acceptability of CBT-i in the treatment of insomnia comorbid to PD and its effectiveness for the management of night and daytime symptoms of insomnia associated with this neurological condition. The objective of this synthesis is to raise awareness among health professionals of the relevance of psychological therapies (mostly CBT) for insomnia in PD. Unlike drug treatments, these therapies are safety for patients who are already weakened by the PD itself.

Recognized in the field of disability and psychiatry, this form of therapy is not developed in gerontology. Objectives: To measure the effects of this therapy on the behavior of elderly people with neurocognitive disorders living in long-term care and especially on the involvement in this activity. Anxiety and apathy were chosen as the measurement criteria. Methods: An intervention study with an experimental cross-study design was conducted over two months for 23 subjects. An intervention group was studied during a period with TAP and a period without TAP. Another group without intervention was also studied. All participants were assessed before and after intervention with the NPI-R scale. The engagement during two TAP sessions and one animation time was also evaluated with the ECPAI scale. Results: In the crossover study, positive engagement is more important in participant/pony interaction than in participant/facilitator interaction (p< 0.01). The ECPAI score reflecting apathetic behavior was significantly decreased during interaction with the animal than in the interaction with the facilitator in patients undergoing therapy (p< 0.01). The ECPAI score reflecting engagement is greater in pony interaction for participants in therapy than in the control group in facilitator interaction (p<0.01). There is no significant change in the scores for the anxiety and apathy items on the NPI-R scale. Conclusion: TAP participates in the positive engagement of the elderly people in the interaction with the animal. These results are consistent with the conclusions of the studies on animal mediation and confirm the clinical observations collected. TAP could work by improving self-esteem and valuing all of the person's preserved abilities.

Cognitive behavioral units (unite cognitivo-comportementale) were created in France to improve care management. The main aim of the current study was to describe the progression of the psychotropic drugs use between admission to discharge. The second aim was to compare the prescriptions of two physicians. Method: Descriptive, retrospective, monocentric study, between may 2016 and may 2018. Results: Psychotropic drugs use was constant regarding the 123 patients. Antipsychotic agents, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine use was lower at discharge (p <0.05), while hypnotic benzodiazepines and antidepressive agents use were higher (p <0.05). For both of physicians, prescriptions were similar except for antipsychotics association and benzodiazepines association. Conclusion: To optimize psychotropic drugs use is an important aim in specialized cognitive behavioral units. Analysis and knowledge sharing shall be kep on going.

Support Groups and Individual Mental Health Care via Video Conferencing for Frontline Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	5			538	543					SEP-OCT 2020	2020	Background: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous stress on the mental health of frontline health care workers. Objective: Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress. Methods: We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians, resident physicians, and nursing staff, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. Results: Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members and the stress of social distancing. Later, the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician-patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.

Longitudinal studies show that insomnia complaint is a persistent condition in PD, especially in patients with more severe insomnia at baseline. When international and standardized criteria are used, it is estimated that more than half of the patients meet the criteria for insomnia disorder. These data define insomnia as the most prevalent sleep disorder in PD. Given that background, it is surprising that none of the scales recommended by the International Parkinson and movement disorder society to assess sleep disturbances in PD is specifically dedicated to the assessment of insomnia disorder. In this insufficient methodological context, we have recently established the discriminant validity of the Sleep condition indicator for insomnia disorder in PD, as diagnosed with a clinical interview according to the DSM-5 criteria. As in the general population, female sex, symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue and daytime sleepiness have been associated with insomnia complaint severity in PD. Insomnia also reduces the quality of life of patients affected by PD and that of their caregivers. In contrast, clinical features of the disease were very slightly related to insomnia with small effect sizes. These features include motor fluctuations, autonomic problems, cardiovascular and thermoregulatory dysfunctions and doses of dopaminergic medications. This observation implies not systematically considering insomnia as a symptomatic manifestation secondary to PD but as a clinical entity requiring specific treatment. The objective of this synthesis is to raise awareness among health professionals of the importance of early detection of insomnia in PD in order to limit the consequences associated with its chronicity. Identifying and assessing insomnia in PD is therefore a major health issue.

The sample was randomly split into two groups with comparable demographics for a sequential analysis that consisted of an exploratory factor analysis on the first subsample followed by a confirmatory factor analysis within a second validation subsample. Results demonstrated a high internal consistency reliability for the Spanish version of the NSI, and a three-factor solution was supported with somatic, affective, and cognitive factors. Findings were comparable to prior studies with the English version of the NSI providing preliminary support for the construct validity of this measure among a large sample of Spanish-speakers. Further study is needed to determine the criterion-related validity of the individual factors as separate subscales and to examine the appropriateness of this measure for individuals with lower levels of education.

PH seems to be increasing in the elderly; however, it has been poorly studied in this group. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic and prognosis features as well as management of pre-capillary PH in the elderly compared to young subjects. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective study in the Regional Hospital of Reims, France. Patients with precapillary PH diagnosed by right cardiac catheterization between January 2008 and December 2016 were included. Elderly patients (aged >65 years at diagnosis) were compared to younger patients (18-64 years). Patients with post-capillary PH were excluded. Results: A total of 146 patients were included, 82 patients were aged 65 years or more (median age 74 years (68-78), 56% women) and 64 non-elderly (median age 54 years (48-61, 5), 52% women). In the elderly group, 31.7% had pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): 15% idiopathic PAH, 36.6% WHO group 3 PH and 28% WHO group 4 PH, with no significant differences with younger patients. In the group of 56 patients with PAH, 26 were elderly (46%). Frequency of comorbidities was similar in both groups, except for arterial hypertension more prevalent in the elderly (52% vs. 34%, p = 0.029). Older patients often had lower extremities oedema (53.3% vs 36.2%, p = 0.045) and reduced 6-minutes walking distance (189 m vs 289, p = 0.004). Younger patients had lower FEV1 (58% vs 75%, p = 0.003) and higher right atrial pressure (12 vs 9, p = 0.023). Oxygeno-therapy and diurectis were more often used in elderly subjects (58.5% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.004) and (82.9% vs. 672%, p = 0.027) respectively. Three-year and five-year survival were lower in elderly patients (53% and 24%, vs 86% and 63%, p = 0.003 and p=0.004 respectively). Conclusion: PH mainly affects individuals aged 65 years and more. Post-capillary PH is more prevalent but precapillary PH could be encountered. Clinical and paraclinical features seem to be similar in both groups. This entity has a worse impact on general health in elderly patient and the prognosis is poor.

Methods: The OCM was fulfilled with the prescriptions of patient aged >= 75 years admitted to a geriatric short-stay unit and sent to general practitioners (GPs) upon discharge. Drug discrepancies (DO) and exposure to polypharmacy after intra-hospital medication conciliation and the ambulatory repeat prescribing (1 month after discharge) were measured. GPs' satisfaction was investigated. Results: The medication list of 173 patients (1242 molecules; median 8 molecules/day) were reconciled, optimized, and transmitted using the OCM to the 89 GPs of the 103 patients who were returned home. Intra-hospital conciliation identified 779 DD (4.6 +/- 2.3) of which 39.0% were missed treatment additions. After renewal of the discharge order, only 1.6 +/- 1.6 DD were measured. Between admission, discharge, and repeat prescribing, exposure to polypharmacy was reduced from 83.2 to 74.6 and 67.7% (p<0.05). Despite a 31.5% response rate to the mail questionnaire, 79.3% of physicians thought the OCM facilitated continuity of care and 75.5% wanted it generalized. Conclusion: This study shows that the OCM is a useful tool and of interest for documenting the process of intra-hospital therapeutic optimization and in the rapid transmission and the follow-up of recommendations by partners in the community.

Material and methods: The protocol around the pictorial figuration consists of four steps (times): a preliminary exploratory interview (T1), a first encounter around pictorial creation (T2), a second encounter more in deep around pictorial creation (T3) and finally, a final interview (T4). We first used the software T-LAB version 9.1.3, a linguistic and statistical tool for text analysis. In this research, we used co-occurrence relationships and word associations recalling moments of narrative structures, according to the humanistic/existential tradition. Findings: We showed the presence of the narrative effects before and after artistic work on the psychological problems inherent in the experience of caregiver and in particular on the anguish of death. The romantic dimension of the story seems to be able to withstand Mrs. Rose's tragic narrative. Conclusion: "Psychic work with pictorial production" can enable the caregiver to depict love and death through a personal narrative borrowing from the narrative universe of romanticism and its existential issues.

Smoking cessation improves a patient's health, his survival, and reduces co-morbidities and the risk of other cancers. The recommendation of smoking cessation is therefore important. However, the rate of smoking cessation after the announcement of this cancer remains low. It is therefore necessary to understand the reasons for continuing or quitting smoking after the announcement of the disease. To this end, we conducted a qualitative survey at a Cancer Control Centre (CLCC). After consultation observations, we met patients in order to collect their experience, uses and practices, and thus their representations of smoking despite the disease. The qualitative data allowed us to better understand the different reasons why some patients consider or begin a withdrawal process, and those for whom permanent cessation of smoking cannot be considered even after the cancer announcement.

The Subject and the Handicap: Neuropsychological and Psychological Follow-up in Children Treated for Cancer								PSYCHO-ONCOLOGIE				14	3			137	143		10.3166/pson-2020-0131			SEP 2020	2020	The reflections presented below stem from clinical exchanges between psychologists and neuropsychologists practicing in pediatric oncology; the patients can face the handicap in the context of the diagnosis, during the oncological treatments and also while they are monitored or cured. These interactions make it possible to combat the risk of immobility linked to disability. Neuropsychological assessments are essential to monitor patient's progress and deficits, and to schedule a care project. No professional is able to predict what will cause handicap for his patient, also depending on the adaptability and integration of each patient. Dealing with the unknown becomes the main issue, where patients, parents or colleagues ask clinicians to fill the anxiety that is so anxiety-provoking.

J	McFarland, Daniel C.; Breitbart, William; Miller, Andrew H.; Nelson, Christian								Depression and Inflammation in Patients With Lung Cancer: A Comparative Analysis of Acute Phase Reactant Inflammatory Markers								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	5			527	537					SEP-OCT 2020	2020	Background: Depression and inflammation are intertwined, which is particularly relevant for patients with lung cancer who have an abundance of inflammation and experience depression. Acute phase reactants (APRs), albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP), are easily interpretable indirect markers of inflammation that have never been concomitantly compared with depression. Inflammation increases CRP (positive APR) and decreases albumin (negative APR). We hypothesize that albumin will be similarly associated with depression, thereby helping to inform the diagnosis of inflammatory depression. Objective: Compares the relationship between depression and representative positive and negative acute phase reactants in patients with metastatic lung cancer. Methods: Patients (n = 109) with metastatic lung cancer were evaluated for depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Inflammation as measured by positive (CRP) and negative (albumin) APRs along with demographic and treatment variables were analyzed for associations with depression. Results: Depression was associated with lower albumin (r = 20.35, P, 0.001), higher CRP (r = 0.47, P, 0.001), and the CRP/albumin ratio (r = 0.45, P, 0.001). Hierarchical linear regression modeling found that albumin was associated with depression when controlling for demographics, disease, and treatment types (b = 20.28, P = 0.01). When both APRs were in the model, only CRP predicted depression (b = 0.31, P = 0.01), and albumin did not moderate CRP and depression. CRP/albumin ratio did not add to understanding depression variability, but patients with both low albumin and high CRP had particularly severe depression. Conclusion: Albumin is associated with depression but not to a greater extent than CRP. The coupling of lower albumin and higher CRP describes more severe depression. Positive and negative APRs may form a distinct biologic signature to help identify patients with inflammatory depression in the lung cancer setting.

Selected empirically for centuries or recently appeared with the help of epigenetic studies, clinical trials and technological innovations, their development increase and are diversified around the world. Residual questions concern 1) their perimeter which seems to overlap with alternative medicines, 2) their evaluation which seems impossible according to some researchers, and 3) their implementation in the elderly which seems too fastidious. This article answers these three questions and then presents digital tools developed by the CEPS University Platform facilitating the evaluation of NPIs in the field of successful aging. The transformation of the health system, which has become necessary to meet the needs of baby-boomers, will widen the arsenal of solutions relevant to health, their combination of medicine and health approach that have become personalized, comprehensive and integrative. NPIs will playa major role there during the century. These practices are distinguished from alternative medicines, general public health messages and socio-cultural offers by continuous research, a quality approach and traceability of use. NPIs today constitute a complementary ecosystem for biomedical treatments whose economic and legal consolidation is increasing.

This disorder is likely to be underdiagnosed and sometimes inadequately treated in the absence of national and international guidelines for this vulnerable population. Few therapeutic trials have specifically focused on the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacologic and psychotherapy treatments for panic disorder in the elderly, and current approaches to detect and manage this disorder are mainly based on experts' opinion or extrapolation from data available in younger adults. This report aims to provide a summary of current knowledge on pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments for panic disorder in the elderly, and to propose a medical treatment algorithm, which should be viewed as a tool that may contribute to the choice of treatment, especially for treatment-resistant older patients with panic disorder. The main results here are the emphasis on antidepressant treatment, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), restricted benzodiazepine usage, take care of drug interactions, and importance of psychotherapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

The electrophysiological response to polarization-modulated patterned visual stimuli								VISION RESEARCH				174				1	9		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.006			SEP 2020	2020	Recent reports indicate that the subjective ability of humans to discriminate between polarization E-vector orientations approaches that of many invertebrates. Here, we show that polarization-modulated patterned stimuli generate an objectively recordable electrophysiological response in humans with normal vision. We investigated visual evoked potential (VEP) and electroretinographic (ERG) responses to checkerboard patterns defined solely by their polarization E-vector orientation alternating between +/- 45 degrees. Correcting for multiple comparisons, paired-samples t-tests were conducted to assess the significance of post-stimulus deflections from baseline measures of noise. Using standard check pattern sizes for clinical electrophysiology, and a patternreversal protocol, participants showed a VEP response to polarization-modulated patterns (PolVEP) with a prominent and consistent positive component near 150 ms (p < 0.01), followed by more variable negative components near 200 ms and 300 ms. The effect was unrecordable with visible wavelengths > 550 nm. Further, pseudo-depolarization negated the responses, while control studies provided confirmatory evidence that the PolVEP response was not the product of luminance artefacts. Polarization-modulated patterns did not elicit a recordable ERG response. The possible origins of the PolVEP signals, and the absence of recordable ERG signals, are discussed. We conclude that evoked cortical responses to polarization-modulated patterns provide an objective measure of foveal function, suitable for both humans and non-human primates with equivalent macular anatomy.

Social Networks of Clients in First-Time DUI Programs								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			655	663					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Social networks play an important role in the development of and recovery from problem drinking behaviors; however, few studies have measured the social networks of individuals convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) or assessed the relationship between social network characteristics and risk for DUI relapse and recidivism. The goal of this study is to describe the social network characteristics of a first-time DUI population in the 2 weeks before the DUI incident; examine demographic differences in social network characteristics by age, ethnicity, and gender; and assess the relationship between social network characteristics and risk factors for DUI. Method: We collected personal (egocentric) social network survey data from 94 participants (65% male) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy with usual care for individuals convicted of a first-time DUI. Multivariate models were used to assess the relationship between pre-DUI personal network characteristics and risk factors for DUI measured at baseline interview. Results: Results indicate that the proportion of drinking partners in one's personal network was positively associated with drinks per week, binge drinking, alcohol use, marijuana use, and alcohol-related consequences. Several dimensions of personal network support were inversely associated with risk factors for DUI. Conclusions: The pre-DUI composition of personal networks has a strong relationship to baseline risk factors for DUI; networks composed of more risky individuals (e.g., drinking partners) were associated with greater substance use and drinking and driving behaviors. Networks with greater levels of social support were associated with lower likelihood of self-reported driving after drinking and intentions to drive after drinking. Interventions that target positive and negative aspects of personal networks may enhance clinical treatments.

Hiding a plane with a pixel: examining shape-bias in CNNs and the benefit of building in biological constraints								VISION RESEARCH				174				57	68		10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.013			SEP 2020	2020	When deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained "end-to-end" on raw data, some of the feature detectors they develop in their early layers resemble the representations found in early visual cortex. This result has been used to draw parallels between deep learning systems and human visual perception. In this study, we show that when CNNs are trained end-to-end they learn to classify images based on whatever feature is predictive of a category within the dataset. This can lead to bizarre results where CNNs learn idiosyncratic features such as high-frequency noise-like masks. In the extreme case, our results demonstrate image categorisation on the basis of a single pixel. Such features are extremely unlikely to play any role in human object recognition, where experiments have repeatedly shown a strong preference for shape. Through a series of empirical studies with standard high-performance CNNs, we show that these networks do not develop a shape-bias merely through regularisation methods or more ecologically plausible training regimes. These results raise doubts over the assumption that simply learning end-to-end in standard CNNs leads to the emergence of similar representations to the human visual system. In the second part of the paper, we show that CNNs are less reliant on these idiosyncratic features when we forgo end-to-end learning and introduce hard-wired Gabor filters designed to mimic early visual processing in V1.

However, under ecological viewing conditions, motion perception occurs in non-retinotopic coordinates. Even though many studies revealed the central role of nonretinotopic processes, very little is known about their mechanisms and neural correlates. Tadin and colleagues found that increasing the spatial size of a high-contrast drifting-Gabor deteriorates motion-direction discrimination, whereas the opposite occurs with a low-contrast stimulus. The results were proposed to reflect an adaptive center-surround antagonism, whereby at low-contrast the excitatory center dominates whereas at high-contrast suppressive-surround mechanisms become more effective. Because ecological vision is non-retinotopic, we tested the hypothesis that the non-retinotopic system also processes motion information by means of an adaptive center-surround mechanism. We used the Ternus-Pikler display designed to provide either a retinotopic or a non-retinotopic reference-frame. Our results suggest that the non-retinotopic processes underlying motion perception are also mediated by an adaptive center-surround mechanism.

However, this integration can sometimes be extremely detrimental, as for example in the case of the Westheimer-McKee phenomenon where features are grouped to form an object. We replicate here the known loss of precision in this phenomenon and document an additional loss of accuracy. These detrimental effects are still present when the object is elicited by other principles of organization, including a cross-modal auditory cue. Similar effects of object formation are found on lateral motion sensitivity. We then present a simple probabilistic model based on the integration of estimated depth within an object and propagation of object mean depth and uncertainty back to the elementary features of the object. This propagation of object uncertainty is a hitherto underestimated side-effect of object formation.

A preferred retinal locus (PRL) on the intact retina is commonly trained as a new "fovea" to help. However, reprogramming the fovea-centered oculomotor control is difficult, so saccades often bring the defunct fovea to block the target. Aligning PRL with distant targets also requires multiple saccades and sometimes head movements. To overcome these problems, we attempted to train normal-sighted observers to form a preferred retinal annulus (PRA) around a simulated scotoma, so that they could rely on the same fovea-centered oculomotor system and make short saccades to align PRA with the target. Observers with an invisible simulated central scotoma (5 degrees radius) practiced making saccades to see a tumbling-E target at 10 degrees eccentricity. The otherwise blurred E target became clear when saccades brought a scotoma-abutting clear window (2 degrees radius) to it. The location of the clear window was either fixed for PRL training, or changing among 12 locations for PRA training. Various cues aided the saccades through training. Practice quickly established a PRL or PRA. Comparing to PRL-trained observers whose first saccade persistently blocked the target with scotoma, PRA-trained observers produced more accurate first saccade. The benefits of more accurate PRA-based saccades also outweighed the costs of slower latency. PRA training may provide an efficient strategy to cope with central vision loss, especially for aging patients who have major difficulties adapting to a PRL.

Lessons from reinforcement learning for biological representations of space								VISION RESEARCH				174				79	93		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.009			SEP 2020	2020	Neuroscientists postulate 3D representations in the brain in a variety of different coordinate frames (e.g. 'head-centred', 'hand-centred' and 'world-based'). Recent advances in reinforcement learning demonstrate a quite different approach that may provide a more promising model for biological representations underlying spatial perception and navigation. In this paper, we focus on reinforcement learning methods that reward an agent for arriving at a target image without any attempt to build up a 3D 'map'. We test the ability of this type of representation to support geometrically consistent spatial tasks such as interpolating between learned locations using decoding of feature vectors. We introduce a hand-crafted representation that has, by design, a high degree of geometric consistency and demonstrate that, in this case, information about the persistence of features as the camera translates (e.g. distant features persist) can improve performance on the geometric tasks. These examples avoid Cartesian (in this case, 2D) representations of space. Non-Cartesian, learned representations provide an important stimulus in neuroscience to the search for alternatives to a 'cognitive map'.

A Qualitative Examination of Gabapentin Misuse Inside of Treatment and Recovery Settings								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			681	686					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Gabapentin, an anti-convulsant medication used to treat seizures and neuralgia, is also prescribed off-label for the treatment of substance use disorders and withdrawal symptoms in treatment settings. Yet, reports of gabapentin misuse are increasing in the United States. The present study examines the misuse of gabapentin in treatment and transitional living facility settings. Method: Data are drawn from a study examining gabapentin misuse in South Florida. The sample includes 34 adult participants who reported past-year use of illicit opioids and/or the misuse of prescription opioid medications, as well as histories of gabapentin misuse and treatment for substance use disorder. Data analyses included descriptive and in vivo coding schemes and used a descriptive qualitative approach. Results: Participants were female (26.5%), White (67.6%), African American/Black (5.9%), Hispanic (20.6%), Asian (2.9%), and other race/ethnicity (2.9%). Mean age was 31.6 years. Findings indicate that inside of treatment and recovery settings, gabapentin misuse occurs as individuals attempt to get high or cope with withdrawal or mental distress symptoms, and one quarter of participants perceived no benefit in misusing gabapentin. Participants also described the concept of "freelapse" (i.e., justifying the misuse of prescribed gabapentin and still considering oneself to be sober). Gabapentin misuse inside of transitional living facilities is common because of limited supervision and screening. Conclusions: Continued research is needed to understand the risk factors for gabapentin misuse and any potential benefits for continued gabapentin administration among treatment patients. Efforts to mitigate gabapentin misuse, including increased supervision and screening in treatment facilities, appear warranted.

J	Warren, Keith; Campbell, Benjamin; Crammer, Skyler								Tightly Bound: The Relationship of Network Clustering Coefficients and Reincarceration at Three Therapeutic Communities								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			673	680					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Clustering, the tendency of individuals to form closed triads, is ubiquitous in human social networks. Previous research has found that therapeutic community (TC) residents whose social networks include a high degree of clustering are less likely to be reincarcerated following discharge. In this study, we test this finding in a larger number of TCs. Method: We use a temporal network autocorrelation model (TNAM) to analyze clustering in social networks of affirmations exchanged between TC residents as a predictor of the hazard of reincarceration. The networks were drawn from three corrections-based TCs, two of which include both men's and women's units and one of which housed only men. Results: The findings were inconsistent across facilities. Increased clustering correlates with a reduced hazard of re-incarceration for women at both facilities (beta = -3.274, 95% CI [-4.299, -2.238]; beta = -18.233, 95% CI [-32.370, -4.095]) and for men at two of the facilities (beta = -0.910, 95% CI [-1.213, -0.606]; beta = -1.393, 95% CI [-1.825, -0.961]). However, clustering increased the hazard of reincarceration for men at one facility (beta = 5.558, 95% CI [4.124, 6.993]). Conclusions: These results support the idea that the likelihood of reincarceration following discharge from a TC is predicted by clustering, a network structure that occurs at a system level between the individual resident and the entire community. Inconsistency in the direction of the relationship suggests that future research should analyze predictors of prosocial clustering in TCs.

Event-Level Predictors of Alcohol-Impaired Driving Intentions								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			647	654					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Alcohol-impaired driving is a significant public safety concern and is highly prevalent among young adults. Considerable research has examined between-person predictors of alcohol-impaired driving, but there has been little research on factors that predict alcohol-impaired driving at the event level. This pilot/feasibility study was designed to identify within-person, event-level predictors of alcohol-impaired driving intentions in the natural environment using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design. Method: Thirty-six young adult, moderate drinkers (M age = 22.9 years; 72.2% female; M drinks per occasion = 3.2) were recruited from a university area to complete 2 weeks of EMA. They reported on their subjective levels of intoxication, perceived dangerousness of driving, and driving intentions during real-world drinking episodes. Breath alcohol concentrations were collected with a portable breath alcohol analyzer. Results: Event-level perceived danger and subjective intoxication most strongly predicted intentions to drive after drinking, such that higher perceived danger and intoxication predicted lower willingness to drive, after adjusting for baseline alcohol-impaired driving attitudes (ps < .001). When we accounted for perceived danger during drinking episodes at the event and person level, baseline attitudes were no longer predictive of willingness to drive. Higher event-level breath alcohol concentration also predicted lower willingness to drive (p = .003). Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate that event-level risks of alcohol-impaired driving can be collected during drinking episodes in the natural environment. Findings indicate that subjective perceptions of intoxication and risk more strongly predict alcohol-impaired driving intentions than objective intoxication. Findings also suggest that event-level perceptions of intoxication and driving risk may be fruitful targets for interventions to reduce alcohol-impaired driving.

Mentorship for Addiction Problems (MAP): A New Behavioral Intervention to Assist in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			664	672					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Mentorship for Addiction Problems (MAP) is a new behavioral treatment formalizing client-to-client mentorship relationships as an adjunct to standard outpatient substance use disorder treatment. We tested the preliminary efficacy of MAP in reducing substance use and associated barriers to successful treatment outcomes. Method: A total of 65 participants (17 later recovery participants [LRPs] and 48 early recovery participants [ERPs]) with substance use disorders were randomized to MAP + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Within MAP, for each cohort, a pool of 4-5 mentors (LRPs) was formed and engaged in mentoring activities for 24 weeks until 12-13 mentees (ERPs), newly admitted, had participated in MAP for 12 weeks. Behavioral and biological measures were conducted at baseline, weekly, monthly, and termination for all participants and during the 12week follow-up for ERPs. Results: Substance use declined across both conditions for ERPs (N = 48) during treatment, Weeks 0-12 (p =.001); however, on average, ERPs in the MAP intervention used significantly fewer days than controls during Treatment Weeks 1-12 (p = .013) and during Follow-Up Weeks 13-24 (p = .043). Addiction Severity Index alcohol and drug use scores increased in TAU and decreased in MAP during Follow-Up Weeks 13-24 for ERPs, alcohol: b = -0.08, SE = 0.03, t(47) = -2.97, p =.005; drug use: b = -0.02, SE = 0.01, t(47) = -2.36, p = .023. In addition, there was high patient interest in MAP and good fidelity to delivery of treatment. Conclusions: MAP shows promise assisting in the reduction of substance use early in treatment when vulnerability and risk for relapse is high and has a positive impact on serious problems undercutting addiction treatment efficacy.

A Longitudinal Analysis of Nicotine Dependence and Transitions From Dual Use of Cigarettes and Electronic Cigarettes: Evidence From Waves 1-3 of the PATH Study								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			595	603					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have gained popularity as a method to reduce conventional cigarette smoking, despite mixed evidence on their effectiveness. This study evaluates the relationship between overall and product-specific nicotine dependence and the transitions between dual use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes versus exclusive cigarette or e-cigarette use over time. Method: This study used data from Waves 1-3 (2013-2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Weighted logistic regressions with person-level random effects tested relationships between nicotine dependence and dual versus exclusive use over time. Dual use transitions were then compared with the characteristics of e-cigarette devices used and reasons to use them. Results: Higher tobacco dependence was associated with becoming or remaining a dual user rather than remaining or becoming an exclusive user of cigarettes or e-cigarettes (p<.05). Higher e-cigarette dependence was associated with remaining or becoming an exclusive e-cigarette user. The number of days smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days was also associated with greater odds of remaining or transitioning to exclusive use of that product (p<.05). Exclusive e-cigarette users tended to invest more financially in their devices and were more likely to report owning modifiable devices. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence that established dual use and transitions to and from dual use are associated with higher tobacco dependence compared with remaining a cigarette- or e-cigarette-only user and that higher e-cigarette dependence is associated with becoming or remaining an exclusive user of e-cigarettes.

Responses to PWUD that go beyond treatment-such as decriminalization and providing a safe supply of pharmaceutical-grade drugs-could reduce impacts of this syndemic. Solutions already implemented for COVID-19, such as emergency safe-supply prescribing and providing housing to people experiencing homelessness, must be sustained once COVID-19 is contained. This pandemic is not only a public health crisis but also a chance to develop and maintain equitable and sustainable solutions to the harms associated with the criminalization of drug use.

We used the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP), an open-access alcohol harms estimator and policy scenario modeler, to estimate the potential health benefits of introducing minimum unit pricing in Quebec, Canada. Method: Aggregated mortality and hospitalization data were obtained from official administrative sources. Alcohol sales and pricing data were obtained from the partial government retail monopoly and Nielsen. Exposure data were from the Canadian Substance Use Exposure Database. Average price changes under two minimum-unit-pricing scenarios were estimated by applying a product-level pricing analysis. The online InterMAHP tool was used to automate the estimation of observed alcohol-attributable harm and what was projected in each policy scenario. Results: Alcohol was estimated to cause 2,850 deaths and 24,694 hospitalizations in Quebec in 2014. Introducing minimum unit pricing of CAD$1.50 was estimated to reduce consumption by 4.4%, alcohol-attributable deaths by 5.9% (95% CI [0.2%, 11.7%]), and alcohol-attributable hospital stays by 8.4% (95% CI [3.2%, 13.7%]). Higher minimum unit pricing of CAD$1.75 was estimated to reduce alcohol-attributable deaths by 11.5% (95% CI [5.9%, 17.2%]) and alcohol-attributable hospital stays by 16.3% (95% CI [11.2%, 21.4%]). Conclusions: The results of this policy modeling study suggest that the introduction of minimum unit pricing between CAD$1.50 and $1.75 would substantially reduce the alcohol-caused burden of disease in Quebec. The quantification of alcohol-caused death and disability, and the changes in these measures under two scenarios, was significantly automated by the open-access resource, InterMAHP.

Method: A total of 4,916 White adolescents in the United Kingdom (mean ages = 16, 17, and 18 years old over three assessment points; 47% female) were used. Tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR genotype was assessed; negative life events were assessed at ages 16 and 17; and frequency of heavy drinking was assessed at ages 16, 17, and 18. Path analyses after controlling for covariate interactions and multigroup cross-lagged analyses were conducted. Results: The null findings of candidate gene and environment interaction and correlation were found in the path analyses controlling for covariate interactions, and they were replicated in the multigroup cross-lagged analyses. No moderation by 5-HTTLPR in the association of negative life events at age 16 with heavy drinking at age 17 as well as no association of negative life events at age 17 with heavy drinking at age 18 were found. Also, the 5-HTTLPR genotype did not moderate the association of heavy drinking at age 16 with negative life events at age 17. Conclusions: Using large prospective data, it appears that there is no evidence for 5-HTTLPR-moderated drinking following experience of negative life events and no support for 5-HTTLPR-moderated selection to negative life events among mid/late adolescents. This finding may inform developmental patterns in gene and environment interaction effects by showing that the effects are less pronounced in mid/late adolescence than in early adolescence.

Alcohol-Related Risky Behavior Patterns and Their Association With Alcohol Use and Perceived Alcohol Stigma in Moshi, Tanzania								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			614	623					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: The Kilimanjaro region has one of the highest rates of reported alcohol use per capita in Tanzania. Alcohol-related risky behaviors pose substantial threats to the health and well-being of alcohol users and the people around them. This study seeks to understand how alcohol-related risky behaviors co-occur with other risky behaviors. Method: Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to examine alcohol-related risky behaviors. The optimal number of latent classes was confirmed by using model fit indices. Negative binomial models were used to test latent classes and their association with harmful and hazardous drinking and perceived alcohol stigma. With the model defined, we explored each class's drinking patterns and risky behavior patterns. Results: A total of 622 (60% male) of 841 participants were included in these analyses because they drank alcohol at least once in their lifetime. Three classes of risky behavior patterns were identified: Class 1, "Limited risk behaviors" (59.7%); Class 2, "Primarily foolish behaviors" (25.6%); and Class 3, "Pervasive risk behaviors" (13.1%). Class 3 had the most alcohol use quantity and frequency. No association between classes and alcohol stigma was found. Compared with males, females are less likely to be classified in Class 2 and 3. Conclusions: Three different classes of risky behaviors became apparent and were distinguished by gender, age, and personal alcohol use. Our findings suggest a potential role for personalized interventions based on latent classes specifically to reduce risk behaviors.

J	Blake, Austin; Smyth, Heather; Sternberg, Ariel; Waddell, Jack; Chassin, Laurie								Alcohol Use Disorder and Parental Alcohol Use Disorder as Predictors of Reproductive Timing								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			575	583					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: Research suggests associations between adolescent alcohol use and early reproduction, but other findings show that alcohol use disorder (AUD) may actually predict delayed reproduction. However, most studies generally do not consider the effects of parental AUD, which is correlated with AUD and may influence reproductive timing. The present study addressed these gaps by testing whether the individual's own AUD and parental AUD interacted with sex to predict reproductive timing. Method: In a longitudinally followed community sample that oversampled familial alcohol disorder (n = 776), multinomial logistic regressions estimated the effects of predictors on early (i.e., adolescent), delayed (age 25 years or later), and no reproduction, thus comparing the odds of each timing category to typical age of reproduction (i.e., 19-24 years of age). Results: There were no interactions between either individual or parental AUD and sex, so interaction terms were trimmed. Individuals with parental AUD were more likely to reproduce early, but there was no effect of AUD on early reproduction. However, those with AUD were more likely to have delayed reproductive timing or no children. Conclusions: AUD and parental AUD are unique predictors of reproductive timing. Parental AUD was associated with early reproduction. Children of parents with AUD may be vulnerable to sexual risk behaviors in adolescence regardless of their own AUD diagnosis, given the constellation of personality and environmental risk factors associated with parental AUD. In contrast, replicating prior findings, AUD was associated with delayed reproduction and the absence of reproduction. AUD may delay reproductive onset through either biological or psychosocial mediators, such as delays in role transitions.

J	Hone, Liana S.

We tested a model in which the effects of sociosexuality on sex with new partners were mediated via drinking in specific contexts. We hypothesized that drinking at parties and bars, which are known to facilitate casual sex (but not drinking at home), would contribute to sex with new (but not with previous) partners. Method: Participants were 427 male freshmen from a large, public northeastern university. They completed a baseline survey in their first semester followed by 56 days of daily reports on drinking and sexual activity during their second semester. Results: As predicted, sociosexuality measured at baseline positively predicted occasions of sex with a new partner, but not sex with a previous partner. In support of the model, effects were partially mediated by frequency of drinking at parties and bars across the 56-day reporting period, but not by drinking at home. Conclusions: Previous research has demonstrated associations among sociosexuality, drinking, and casual sex. Our study is unique in suggesting that drinking in specific contexts-that is, drinking at parties and bars, but not drinking at home-partially mediates the effects of sociosexuality on sex with new partners. This pathway suggests that men with a desire for many novel, concurrent, uncommitted sex partners seek out drinking contexts as a way of facilitating these encounters.		[Hone, Liana S.

Method: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using complex sample survey data collected from 2013 to 2018 from 12,138 adults (6,998 women) at modal ages 35 or 55 participating in the U.S. national Monitoring the Future study. Results: Diverted use was reported by 72.9% [95% CI, 66.4, 79.4] and 64.3% [56.0, 72.7] of age 35 and 55 past-12-month medical marijuana users, respectively. Age 35 diverted users were more likely than recommended users to not work full time and have no postsecondary education. Age 55 recommended users were more likely than NMM users to be retired. Age 35 diverted users were less likely than recommended users to report poor physical health (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40 [0.17, 0.94]). Age 55 diverted users were less likely than recommended users to report three or more poor health conditions (OR = 0.22 [0.09, 0.55]) and any qualifying conditions (OR = 0.21 [0.08, 0.58]). Prevalence of these conditions was similar between diverted and NMM users. Conclusions: Results indicated a substantial degree of nonmedical (i.e., recreational) marijuana use. Diverted and NMM users reported generally similar levels of health conditions, whereas diverted users had fewer indicators of poor health than recommended users.

J	Sato, Hiromi; Motoyoshi, Isamu								Distinct strategies for estimating the temporal average of numerical and perceptual information								VISION RESEARCH				174				41	49		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.004			SEP 2020	2020	Humans can estimate global trends in dynamic information presented either as perceptual features or as symbolic codes such as numbers. Previous studies on temporal statistics estimation have shown that observers judge the temporal average of visual attributes according to information from the last few frames of the presentation sequence (in what is referred to as the recency effect). Here, we investigated how humans estimate the temporal average of number vs. orientation using identical stimuli for the two tasks. In Experiment 1, a randomly-selected single-digit number was serially presented at orientations randomly varying over time. In Experiment 2, a texture comprising a random number of Gabor elements was shown at orientations randomly varying over time. In both experiments, observers judged the temporal averages of the numerical values and orientations in separate blocks. Results showed that observers judging the temporal average of orientation relied upon information from later frames as predicted by a typical model of perceptual decision making. By contrast, for the judgement of numerical values, we found that the impacts of each temporal frame were constant or varied little across temporal frames regardless of whether the numerical information was given as digits or by the number of texture elements. The results are interpreted as evidence that distinct computational strategies may be involved in estimating the temporal averages of perceptual features and numerical information.

Developments in non-invasive visual electrophysiology								VISION RESEARCH				174				50	56		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.003			SEP 2020	2020	To study the physiology of the primate visual system, non-invasive electrophysiological techniques are of major importance. Two main techniques are available: the electroretinogram (ERG), a mass potential originating in the retina, and the visual evoked potential (VEP), which reflects activity in the primary visual cortex. In this overview, the history and the state of the art of these techniques are briefly presented as an introduction to the special issue "New Developments in non-invasive visual electrophysiology". The overview and the special issue can be used as the starting point for exciting new developments in the electrophysiology of primate and mammalian vision.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ARNDs in SouthWales, U.K., and determine the specific diagnostic terms and criteria used in clinical practice. Method: A naturalistic, survey-based prevalence study was undertaken wherein data were collected retrospectively for all individuals with ARNDs attending services during all of 2015 and 2016. A diverse sample of health and social care services (N = 60) in South Wales took part in the study. Results: A total of 490 individuals with ARNDs were identified by participating services, equating to an age-specific rate of 34 individuals per 100,000 inhabitants. Variability was observed across age ranges and genders, with most identified in the 45-64 year age range and a male:female ratio of 2.6:1. Twenty-three individuals younger than age 35 were identified, demonstrating an increase in younger cases compared with previous studies. Various diagnostic terms were used, with "alcohol-related brain damage" being most common. Only 6.3% of cases were diagnosed according to specific criteria and 44.3% were reported as having a "probable" ARND, meaning no official diagnosis had been designated but initial assessments indicated that they likely had an ARND. Conclusions: Findings provide a novel understanding of ARND prevalence in a previously understudied area, although the prevalence estimate is conservative and should be interpreted cautiously for reasons discussed. Findings also highlight an inconsistency between diagnoses presented in nosological systems (e.g., International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision) and those used in practice and therefore a need to evaluate novel diagnostic conceptualizations of alcohol-related neurocognitive impairment.

J	Norstrom, Thor; Ramstedt, Mats								The Link Between Alcohol Sales and Alcohol-Related Harm in Finland, 1995-2016								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	5			641	646					SEP 2020	2020	Objective: A key assumption in Finnish alcohol policy is that the officially registered alcohol consumption (i.e., alcohol sales) is closely related to alcohol-related harm. During the last two decades, a sizable part of total alcohol consumption, however, comprises unrecorded consumption, which may potentially make alcohol sales less powerful as a predictor of alcohol-related harm. This article thus aims to estimate the relationship between alcohol sales and alcohol-related harm on the basis of more recent Finnish time-series data. Method: Data on alcohol sales (liters of 100% alcohol/capita age 15 years and older) were obtained from the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland. As indicators of harm, we used police-reported assaults and three forms of mortality: alcohol-specific mortality, accidents, and suicide. Quarterly data on mortality and alcohol sales spanned the period 1995-2016, and data on police-reported offenses covered the period 1990-2016. Data were analyzed by SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling. Results: A positive and significant association between alcohol sales and all harm indicators was found. A 1-L increase in alcohol sales per capita was associated with a 20% increase in alcohol-specific mortality, a 12% increase in assaults, and a 5%-6% increase in accidents and suicide. These estimates are in line with earlier findings estimated on data for the period when unrecorded alcohol consumption was less common in Finland. Conclusions: The results provide support for a continued strong relationship between alcohol sales and alcohol-related harm in Finland. Policy measures aimed at lowering alcohol sales were supported from these results.

Less study has focused on exploring the neural correlates of the memory retrieval of scientific concepts when presented in word and picture modalities. Fewer studies have investigated the differences in the involved brain regions and how the brain dynamics in these regions would associate with the accuracy of the memory retrieval process. Therefore, this study specifically focused on investigating the human brain dynamics of participants when they retrieve physics concepts in word vs. pictorial modalities, and whether electroencephalogram (EEG) activities can predict the correctness of the retrieval of physics concepts. The results indicated that word modality induced a significant stronger right frontal theta augmentation than pictorial modality during the physics concepts retrieval process, whereas the picture modality induced a significantly greater right parietal alpha suppression than the word modality throughout the retrieval process spurred by the physics concept presentations. In addition, greater frontal midline theta augmentation was observed for incorrect responses than the correct responses during retrieve physics concepts. Moreover, the frontal midline theta power has greater negative predictive power for predicting the accuracy of physics concepts retrieval. In summary, the participants were more likely to retrieve physics concepts correctly if a lower amount of theta were allocated during the maintaining period from 2,000 ms through 3,500 ms before making responses. It provides insight for our future application of brain computer interface (BCI) in real-time science learning. This study implies that the lower frontal midline theta power is associated with a lower degree of cognitive control and active maintenance of representations as participants approach a correct answer.

The challenge in assuring successful implementation of bidirectional dBCIs in Parkinson's disease (PD) is to discover and decode stable, robust and reliable neural inputs that can be tracked during stimulation, and to optimize neurostimulation patterns and parameters (control policies) for motor behaviors at the brain interface, which are customized to the individual. In this perspective, we will outline the work done in our lab regarding the evolution of the discovery of neural and behavioral control variables relevant to PD, the development of a novel personalized dual-threshold control policy relevant to the individual's therapeutic window and the application of these to investigations of closed-loop STN DBS driven by neural or kinematic inputs, using the first generation of bidirectional dBCIs.

ARSG requires attention, visual working memory (VWM), sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities, thus offering promising insights into the learning-induced plasticity. However, it is yet unknown whether the ARSG experience is related to the development of VWM capacity. Using both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements, this study tested whether ARSG experts had larger VWM capacity than non-experts in a change detection task. The behavioral results showed that ARSG experts had higher accuracy and larger VWM capacity than non-experts. In addition, the ERP results revealed that the difference wave of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) component (size 4-size 2) elicited by experts was significantly larger than that of non-experts, suggesting that the VWM capacity was higher in experts than in non-experts. Thus, the findings suggested that prolonged ARSG experience is correlative with the enhancement of VWM.

Methods: Thirty subjects, divided into two groups (aerobic and effort), undergo twelve cognitive tests from CBS. A comparison between the pre- and post-exercise results in terms of cognitive performance differences is carried out. Regression analysis between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features and CBS tests results is performed. Results: In most CBS tests, there is an improvement, or at least a confirmation, of the subject's cognitive ability, for both groups. Reasoning (80-100%), concentration (80-87%), and planning tests (93-100%) seem to undergo critical positive changes. The regression analysis, performed by using a set of different algorithms, has demonstrated that it is possible, by monitoring the HRV during the exercise, to predict to some extent the cognitive performance, i.e., the CBS tests results. The best performing regression algorithms are Simple Linear (Quade Test-aerobic group: 2.098, effort group: 3.350, both groups: 2.747) and REPTree (Quade Test-aerobic group: 2.955, effort group: 3.315, both groups: 3.121). The statistical analysis has proved that physical activity is statistically useful for the subjects in improving their cognitive performance. Conclusions: This study has numerically appraised the improvement, the conservation, or the worsening on different aspects of cognition. The found mathematical relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance suggests that it is possible to predict the beneficial effect of various exercises on executive and attentive control.

Neural Correlates of Group Versus Individual Problem Solving Revealed by fMRI								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						290	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00290			AUG 28 2020	2020	Group problem solving is a prototypical complex collective intellectual activity. Psychological research provides compelling evidence that problem solving in groups is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from doing so alone. However, the question of whether individual and collective problem solving involve the same neural substrate has not yet been addressed, mainly due to methodological limitations. In the current study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to compare brain activation when participants solved Raven-like matrix problems in a small group and individually. In the group condition, the participant in the scanner was able to discuss the problem with other team members using a special communication device. In the individual condition, the participant was required to think aloud while solving the problem in the silent presence of the other team members. Greater activation was found in several brain regions during group problem solving, including the medial prefrontal cortex; lateral parietal, cingulate, precuneus and retrosplenial cortices; frontal and temporal poles. These areas have been identified as potential components of the so-called "social brain" on the basis of research using offline judgments of material related to socializing. Therefore, this study demonstrated the actual involvement of these regions in real-time social interactions, such as group problem solving. However, further connectivity analysis revealed that the social brain components are co-activated, but do not increase their coupling during cooperation as would be suggested for a holistic network. We suggest that the social mode of the brain may be described instead as a re-configuration of connectivity between basic networks, and we found decreased connectivity between the language and salience networks in the group compared to the individual condition. A control experiment showed that the findings from the main experiment cannot be entirely accounted for by discourse comprehension. Thus, the study demonstrates affordances provided by the presented new technique for neuroimaging the "group mind," implementing the single-brain version of the second-person neuroscience approach.

Twenty-six drug-naive patients (DNP) and 22 drug-receiving patients (DRP) with BECTS were collected in this study. Static amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) were applied to resting-state fMRI data. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed for affected regions identified by static and dynamic analysis. One-way analysis of variance andpost hocstatistical analyses were performed for between-group differences. Abnormal sALFF and dALFF values were correlated with clinical features of patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC), DNP group demonstrated alterations of sALFF and/or dALFF in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellum, hippocampus, pallidum and cingulate cortex, in which the values were close to normal in DRP. Notably, sALFF and dALFF showed specific sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in basal ganglia and cerebellum. Additionally, DRP showed additional changes in precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and occipital visual cortex. Compared with HC, the DNP showed increased FC in default network and motion-related networks, and the DRP showed decreased FC in default network. The MPFC, hippocampus, SMA, basal ganglia and cerebellum are indicated to be intrinsically affected regions and effective therapeutic targets. And the FC profiles of default and motion-related networks might be potential core indicators for clinical treatment. This study revealed potential neuromodulatory targets and helped understand pathomechanism of BECTS. Static and dynamic analyses should be combined to investigate neuropsychiatric disorders.

However, it remains unclear how meditation impacts internal attention (IA) states due to lack of measurement tools that can objectively assess mental states during meditation practice itself, and produce time estimates of internal focus at individual or group levels. To address these measurement gaps, we tested the feasibility of applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to single-subject fMRI data to: (1) learn and recognize internal attentional states relevant for meditation during a directed IA task; and (2) decode or estimate the presence of those IA states during an independent meditation session. Within a mixed sample of experienced meditators and novice controls (N= 16), we first used MVPA to develop single-subject brain classifiers for five modes of attention during an IA task in which subjects were specifically instructed to engage in one of five states [i.e., meditation-related states: breath attention, mind wandering (MW), and self-referential processing, and control states: attention to feet and sounds]. Using standard cross-validation procedures, MVPA classifiers were trained in five of six IA blocks for each subject, and predictive accuracy was tested on the independent sixth block (iterated until all volumes were tested,N= 2,160). Across participants, all five IA states were significantly recognized well above chance (>41% vs. 20% chance). At the individual level, IA states were recognized in most participants (87.5%), suggesting that recognition of IA neural patterns may be generalizable for most participants, particularly experienced meditators. Next, for those who showed accurate IA neural patterns, the originally trained classifiers were applied to a separate meditation run (10-min) to make an inference about the percentage time engaged in each IA state (breath attention, MW, or self-referential processing). Preliminary group-level analyses demonstrated that during meditation practice, participants spent more time attending to breath compared to MW or self-referential processing. This paradigm established the feasibility of using MVPA classifiers to objectively assess mental states during meditation at the participant level, which holds promise for improved measurement of internal attention states cultivated by meditation.

The survey assessed physical IPV perpetration, depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, marijuana use, illegal drug use, prescription opioid misuse, and demographic characteristics. We calculated descriptive statistics and conducted weighted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to assess associations of IPV perpetration with prescription opioid misuse and other known IPV risk factors.Results: Weighted analyses show 19.4% of men reported IPV perpetration in the current or most recent relationship, and 7.3% reported prescription opioid misuse in the past year. After controlling for marijuana use, illegal drug use, depressive symptoms, and demographic characteristics, prescription opioid misuse in the past year (A.O.R. = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.33-2.84) was associated with increased odds of young men's physical IPV perpetration in the current or most recent relationship.Conclusions/importance: Prescription opioid misuse is associated with IPV perpetration at a population-level among young men and is not unique to clinical samples. Prevention and intervention strategies should be developed to simultaneously target prescription opioid misuse and IPV perpetration.

The experiments tested three different learning paradigms, namely, biological, biomimetic, and non-biomimetic models for gender identification from human gait. Psychophysical experiments with twenty-one observers were conducted along with computational experiments without applying any gender specific modifications to the models or the stimuli. Results demonstrate the utilization of a generic memory based learning system in humans for gait perception, thus reducing ambiguity between two opposing learning systems proposed for biological motion perception. Results also support the biomimetic nature of memory based artificial neural networks (ANN) in their ability to emulate biological neural networks, as opposed to non-biomimetic models. In addition, the comparison between biological and computational learning approaches establishes a memory based biomimetic model as the best candidate for a generic artificial gait classifier (83% accuracy,p< 0.001), compared to human observers (66%,p< 0.005) or non-biomimetic models (83%,p< 0.001) while adhering to human-like sensitivity to gender identification, promising potential for application of the model in any given non-gender based gait perception objective with superhuman performance.

The Effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Sleep Time and Efficiency								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						357	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00357			AUG 27 2020	2020	A single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to increase arousal in healthy participants for up to 24 h post-stimulation. However, little is known about the effects of tDCS on subsequent sleep in this population. Based on previous clinical studies, we hypothesized that anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) would produce higher arousal with decreased sleep time and stimulation to the primary motor cortex (M1) would have the converse effect. Thirty-six active duty military were randomized into one of three groups (n= 12/group); active anodal tDCS over the lDLPFC, active anodal tDCS over left M1, or sham tDCS. Participants answered questionnaires 3 times a day and wore a wrist activity monitor (WAM) to measure sleep time and efficiency for 3 weeks. On weeks 2 and 3 (order counterbalance), participants received stimulation at 1800 h before 26 h of sustained wakefulness testing (sleep deprived) and at 1800 h without sleep deprivation (non-sleep deprived). There were no significant effects for the non-sleep deprived portion of testing. For the sleep deprived portion of testing, there were main effects of group and night on sleep time. The DLPFC group slept less than the other groups on the second and third night following stimulation. There is no negative effect on mood or sleep quality from a single dose of tDCS when participants have normal sleep patterns (i.e., non-sleep deprived portion of testing). The results suggest that stimulation may result in faster recovery from fatigue caused by acute periods of sleep deprivation, as their recovery sleep periods were less.

The amygdala is a key region of these functions and can be divided into three subregions, each of which has a different function and connectivity. We investigated whether the amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity is associated with the effect of anti-stigma interventions on reducing mental health-related stigma in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) over 12 months. Healthy young adults [n= 77, age, mean (SD) = 21.23 (0.94) years; male,n= 48], who were subsampled from an RCT (n= 259) investigating the effect of anti-stigma interventions, using filmed social contacts (FSC) or internet self-learning (INS), on reducing stigma, underwent 10 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging between the trial registration and 12 months follow-up. The extent of stigma was assessed at the baseline, post-intervention and 12 month follow-up surveys, using the Japanese-language version of the Social Distance Scale (SDSJ), to assess negative emotional attitude toward people with schizophrenia. We compared associations between amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity and changes in the SDSJ scores for 12 months across the control, INS, and FSC groups. Associations between the change in stigma for 12 months and the superficial (SF) subregion of the amygdala-related connectivity in the intracalcarine cortex [(x, y, z) = (-8, -66, 12), z = 4.21,PFWE-corrected= 0.0003, cluster size = 192] differed across groups. Thepost hocanalysis showed that the SF-intracalcarine cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with the change in stigma only in the FSC group. The current results indicate that greater SF-intracalcarine cortex connectivity is associated with a better response to the FSC interventions, suggesting that biological variability could underlie the long-term effect of anti-stigma interventions on stigma in the real world.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method to modulate cortical excitability, inducing neuroplastic changes to the targeted cortical areas and has been suggested to potentially improve motor functions in individuals with neurological impairments. The purpose of this double-blinded, sham-controlled study was to examine the acute effects of anodal tDCS over the lesioned motor cortex leg area with concurrent limits of stability training on postural control in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis. Ten individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis received either anodal or sham tDCS stimulation over the lesioned leg region of the motor cortex while undergoing 20 min of postural training. The type of stimulation to receive during the first session was pseudorandomized, and the two sessions were separated by 14 days. Before and immediately after 20 min of tDCS, the 10 m walk test, the Berg Balance Scale, and dynamic posturography assessments were performed. After a single session of anodal tDCS with concurrent postural training, we observed no changes in clinical measures of balance and walking, assessed using the Berg Balance Scale and 10 m walk test. For dynamic posturography assessments, participants demonstrated improvements in adaptation responses to toes-up and toes-down perturbations, regardless of the type of tDCS received. Additionally, improved performance in the shifting center of gravity was observed during anodal tDCS. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that tDCS can potentially be used as a feasible approach be incorporated into the rehabilitation of chronic post-stroke individuals with issues related to postural control and fear of falling, and that multiple sessions of tDCS stimulation may be needed to improve functional measures of postural control and walking.

In a previous study, Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT) was effective in improving depression and low mood in persons with chronic non-fluent aphasia. We present a proof-of-concept case-control study that evaluates language and mood outcomes amongst persons with fluent post-stroke aphasia. Participants:Thirteen Spanish speaking persons with fluent aphasia due to chronic stroke lesions in the left hemisphere participated in the study. Intervention:Five participants (intervention group) received ILAT for 3 h/day during two consecutive weeks, for an overall of 30 h, and 8 participants (control group) entered a waiting-list no-treatment arm. Results:The main finding was that participants receiving active treatment showed significant improvements on depression and aphasia severity scores, whereas no significant changes were found in the control group. Conclusions:The implementation of ILAT was efficient in improving clinical language deficits in people with fluent aphasia and contributes to improvement in mood after therapy.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	1			131	147		10.1080/09602011.2020.1808023			JAN 2 2022	2022	MS related fatigue might be related to autonomous nervous system (ANS) dysfunctions or to inflammation related vagal (hyper-) activation. Consequently, influencing ANS status may lead to relieve of fatigue. We used two opposite biofeedback interventions to either increase sympathetic ("self-alert training", SAT) or parasympathetic activation ("progressive muscle relaxation", PMR). We recorded fatigue status of patients before and after a challenging vigilance task, their behavioural performance on this task, their skin conductance response (SCR), and parameters indicating parasympathetic activity concerning heart rate variability (HRV). We repeated these recordings after the biofeedback training sessions. Patients of the SAT group were able to learn to increase their SCR voluntarily. Patients of the PMR group showed increasing parameters indicating parasympathetic modulation of the HRV. The vigilance task increased their feeling of fatigue. However, there was no effect of biofeedback training on either fatigue status or performance on the vigilance task. Our results show that MS patients can learn to change voluntarily their ANS activity using biofeedback instructions based on SCR and this can be used in future studies to test the postulated link between ANS and fatigue. However, in this experimental intervention we were unable to document a relation between ANS activity and fatigue.

But accurate delineation of EZ based on HFOs is still challenging. Our study compared HFOs from EZ and non-EZ on the basis of their associations with interictal slow waves, aiming at exploring a new way to localize EZ. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcome were included. Five minute interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) epochs of slow-wave sleep were randomly selected; then ripples (80-200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 200-500 Hz), and slow waves (0.1-4 Hz) were automatically analyzed. The EZ and non-EZ were identified by resection range during the surgeries. We found that both ripples and FRs superimposed more frequently on slow waves in EZ than in non-EZ (P< 0.01). Although ripples preferred to occur on the down state of slow waves in both two groups, ripples in EZ tended to be closer to the down-state peak of slow wave than in non-EZ (-174 vs. -231 ms,P= 0.008). As for FR, no statistical difference was found between the two groups (P= 0.430). Additionally, slow wave-containing ripples in EZ had a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.5 mu V/ms,P< 0.001) and wider distribution ratio (32.3 vs. 30.1%,P< 0.001) than those in the non-EZ. But for slow wave-containing FR, only a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.4 mu V/ms,P< 0.001) was observed. Our study innovatively compared the different features of association between HFOs and slow wave in EZ and non-EZ from refractory focal epilepsy with good surgical outcome, proposing a new method to localize EZ and facilitating the surgical plan.

Subthreshold Electrical Noise Applied to the Plantar Foot Enhances Lower-Limb Cutaneous Reflex Generation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						351	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00351			AUG 26 2020	2020	Reflex responses generated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the plantar foot are important for the maintenance of balance during postural tasks and gait. With aging, reflex generation, particularly from fast adapting type I receptors, is reduced, which likely contributes to impaired postural stability in this population. Therefore, improving reflex generation from these receptors may serve as a tool to improve balance performance. A mechanism to enhance reflexes may lie in the phenomenon of stochastic resonance, whereby the addition of certain intensities and frequencies of noise stimuli improves the performance of a system. This study was conducted to determine whether tactile noise stimuli could improve cutaneous reflex generation. In 12 healthy young adults, we evoked cutaneous reflex responses using a 0-50 Hz Gaussian noise vibration applied to the plantar heel. Concurrently, we applied one of six subthreshold intensities of electrical tactile noise to the plantar heel [0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% (threshold)] and were able to analyze data from 0%, 20% and 40% trials. Across participants, it was found that the addition of a 20% perceptual threshold (PT) noise resulted in enhanced reflex responses when analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. These data provide evidence that cutaneous reflex generation can be enhancedviaa stochastic resonance effect and that 20% PT is the optimal intensity of noise to do so. Therefore, the addition of noise stimuli may be a valuable clinical intervention to improve reflex responses associated with postural balance in populations with impairments.

To explore this hypothesis in children, we applied a graph theory approach to examine connectivity in neural networks in the resting-state EEG in 35 children with PNES, 31 children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES), and 75 healthy controls. Methods The networks were extracted from Laplacian-transformed time series by a coherence connectivity estimation method. Results Children with PNES (vs. controls) showed widespread changes in network metrics: increased global efficiency (gamma and beta bands), increased local efficiency (gamma band), and increased modularity (gamma and alpha bands). Compared to controls, they also had higher levels of autonomic arousal (e.g., lower heart variability); more anxiety, depression, and stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales; and more adverse childhood experiences on the Early Life Stress Questionnaire. Increases in network metrics correlated with arousal. Children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES) showed scattered and less pronounced changes in network metrics. Conclusion The results indicate that children with PNES present with increased activation of neural networks coupled with increased physiological arousal. While this shift in functional organization may confer a short-term adaptive advantage-one that facilitates neural communication and the child's capacity to respond self-protectively in the face of stressful life events-it may also have a significant biological cost. It may predispose the child's neural networks to periods of instability-presenting clinically as PNES-when the neural networks are faced with perturbations in energy flow or with additional demands.

We found an association of trait respect with reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in part of the left ATL. Moreover, since the ATL is involved in general conceptual knowledge, we investigated the relationships between other social emotions with similar properties as respect and the GMV of the left ATL. We observed an association of reduced GMV with empathic concern, which is an other-oriented and affective aspect of trait empathy.

Previous research suggests that musical tempo modulates listeners' cardiovascular activity. We report an investigation of musicians' melody performances measured over a 12-h day and subsequent changes in the musicians' physiological activity. Skilled pianists completed four testing sessions in a single day as cardiac activity was recorded during an initial 5 min of baseline rest and during performances of familiar and unfamiliar melodies. Results indicated slower tempi for familiar and unfamiliar melodies at early testing times. Performance rates at 09 h were predicted by differences in participants' alertness and musical training; these differences were not explained by sleep patterns, chronotype, or cardiac activity. Individual differences in pianists' performance tempo were consistent across testing sessions: participants with a faster tempo at 09 h maintained a faster tempo at later testing sessions. Cardiac measures at early testing times indicated increased heart rates and more predictable cardiac dynamics during music performance than baseline rest, and during performances of unfamiliar melodies than familiar melodies. These findings provide the first evidence of cardiac dynamics that are unique to music performance contexts.

A balance of activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) in both hemispheres is essential for functional recovery. In this study, we assessed the intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional M1 area in four patients with severe upper limb spasticity after chronic stroke and treated with botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) injection and 12 weeks of upper limb rehabilitation. There was little to no change in the level of spasticity post-injection, and only one participant experienced a small improvement in arm function. All reported improvements in quality of life. However, the levels of intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the contralesional hemisphere were different at baseline for all four participants, and there was no clear pattern in the response to the intervention.

J	Arnold, Andrew J.; Winkielman, Piotr								Smile (but only deliberately) though your heart is aching: Loneliness is associated with impaired spontaneous smile mimicry								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				16	1			26	38		10.1080/17470919.2020.1809516			JAN 2 2021	2021	As social beings, humans harbor an evolved capacity for loneliness - perceived social isolation. Loneliness is associated with atypical affective and social processing, as well as physiological dysregulation. We investigated how loneliness influences spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM), an interpersonal response involved in social connection and emotional contagion. We presented participants with emotional stimuli, such as video clips of actors expressing anger, fear, sadness, or joy, and emotional IAPS images. We measured participants' zygomaticus major ("smiling") muscle and their corrugator supercilii ("frowning") muscle with facial electromyography (fEMG). We also measured self-reported loneliness, depression, and extraversion levels. For socially connected individuals we found intact SFM, as reflected in greater fEMG activity of the zygomaticus and corrugator to positive and negative expressions, respectively. However, individuals reporting higher levels of loneliness lacked SFM for expressions of joy. Loneliness did not impair deliberate mimicry activity to the same expressions, or spontaneous reactions to positive, negative, or neutral IAPS images. Depression and extraversion did not predict any differences in fEMG responses. We suggest that impairments in spontaneous "smiling back" at another - a decreased interpersonal resonance - could contribute to negative social and emotional consequences of loneliness and may facilitate loneliness contagion.

It is known that musical expertise is associated with a range of auditory perceptual skills, including discriminating frequency change, which suggests the neural encoding of spectral features can be enhanced by musical training. In this study, we measured auditory cortical responses to frequency change in musicians to examine the relationships between N1/P2 responses and behavioral performance/musical training. Methods: Behavioral and electrophysiological data were obtained from professional musicians and age-matched non-musician participants. Behavioral data included frequency discrimination detection thresholds for no threshold-equalizing noise (TEN), +5, 0, and -5 signal-to-noise ratio settings. Auditory-evoked responses were measured using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) system in response to frequency changes in ongoing pure tones consisting of 250 and 4,000 Hz, and the magnitudes of frequency change were 10%, 25% or 50% from the base frequencies. N1 and P2 amplitudes and latencies as well as dipole source activation in the left and right hemispheres were measured for each condition. Results: Compared to the non-musician group, behavioral thresholds in the musician group were lower for frequency discrimination in quiet conditions only. The scalp-recorded N1 amplitudes were modulated as a function of frequency change. P2 amplitudes in the musician group were larger than in the non-musician group. Dipole source analysis showed that P2 dipole activity to frequency changes was lateralized to the right hemisphere, with greater activity in the musician group regardless of the hemisphere side. Additionally, N1 amplitudes to frequency changes were positively related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination while enhanced P2 amplitudes were associated with a longer duration of musical training. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that auditory cortical potentials evoked by frequency change are related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination in musicians. Larger P2 amplitudes in musicians compared to non-musicians reflects musical training-induced neural plasticity.

The purpose of this study is to explore how chronic low back pain changes empathy. Methods: Twenty-four chronic low back pain patients and 22 healthy controls were recruited. We set up an experimental pain-exposed model for each healthy subject. All subjects received a painful-empathic magnetic resonance scan. After the scan, all subjects rated the pain intensity and multiple empathy-related indicators. The clinical assessment scale was the 20-item Basic Empathy Scale in Adults. Result: The chronic low back pain patients reported lower scores on the total scores of BES-A, the subscale scores of emotional disconnection and cognitive empathy, and the discomfort rating. The fMRI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were multiple abnormal brain pathways centered on the anterior insula. The DTI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were reduced fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left anterior corona radiate (ACR). Conclusion: Our study found that patients with chronic low back pain have impaired empathy ability. The abnormal functional connectivity of multiple brain networks, multiple damaged white matter tracts, and the lower behavioral scores in chronic low back pain patients supported our findings.

Methods: Eighty healthy overweight or obese office workers aged 40-67 years were individually randomized to an intervention group, receiving a treadmill workstation and encouraging emails, or to a control group, continuing to work as usual. Effects on cognitive function, hippocampal volume, prefrontal cortex (PFC) thickness, and circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed. Further, mediation analyses between changes in walking time and light-intensity physical activity (LPA) on changes in BDNF and hippocampal volume between baseline and 13 months, and multivariate analyses of the baseline data with percentage sitting time as the response variable, were performed. Results: No group by time interactions were observed for any of the outcomes. In the mediation analyses, positive associations between changes in walking time and LPA on changes in hippocampal volume were observed, although not mediated by changes in BDNF levels. In the multivariate analyses, a negative association between percentage sitting time and hippocampal volume was observed, however only among those older than 51 years of age. Conclusion: Although no group by time interactions were observed, our analyses suggest that increased walking and LPA may have positive effects on hippocampal volume and that sedentary behavior is associated with brain structures of importance for memory functions.

Predictors of opioid misuse include past diagnoses of mental health and substance use, demographic characteristics and potentially risky behaviors. Outcomes include receiving UDT prior to opioid prescription among the two naive samples and within six months for the long-term sample. We report predicted probabilities (PP) from logistic regressions and hazard ratios (HR) and Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:A small percentage of patients received UDT (naive sample: 2.5%; naive with a second follow-up prescription sample: 3.5%; long-term sample: 9.9%). Adults with alcohol disorders and other substance use disorders had the highest PP of UDT, among both the naive (alcohol related disorder: 3.1%; other substance use disorder: 7.7%) and the naive with a second follow-up prescription (alcohol related disorder: 4.1%; other substance use disorder: 11.7%) samples. Among the long-term sample, similar predictors were significant.Conclusions:Although there was an association between having risk factors for opioid misuse (e.g. past alchohol disorders and other substance use disorder diagnoses) and receiving UDT, the percentage of patients who received UDT was unexpectedly low, pointing to the need to increase guideline adherence and implementation among providers who prescribe opioids.

Proactive Control of Emotional Distraction: Evidence From EEG Alpha Suppression								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						318	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00318			AUG 18 2020	2020	Biased attention towards emotional stimuli is adaptive, as it facilitates responses to important threats and rewards. An unfortunate consequence is that emotional stimuli can become potent distractors when they are irrelevant to current goals. How can this distraction be overcome despite the bias to attend to emotional stimuli? Recent studies show that distraction by irrelevant flankers is reduced when distractor frequency is high, even if they are emotional. A parsimonious explanation is that the expectation of frequent distractors promotes the use of proactive control, whereby attentional control settings can be altered to minimize distraction before it occurs. It is difficult, however, to infer proactive control on the basis of behavioral data alone. We therefore measured neural indices of proactive control while participants performed a target-detection task in which irrelevant peripheral distractors (either emotional or neutral) could appear either frequently (on 75% of trials) or rarely (on 25% of trials). We measured alpha power during the pre-stimulus period to assess proactive control and during the post-stimulus period to determine the consequences of control for subsequent processing. Pre-stimulus alpha power was tonically suppressed in the high, compared to low, distractor frequency condition, regardless of expected distractor valence, indicating sustained use of proactive control. In contrast, post-stimulus alpha suppression was reduced in the high-frequency condition, suggesting that proactive control reduced the need for post-stimulus adjustments. Our findings indicate that a sustained proactive control strategy accounts for the reduction in both emotional and non-emotional distraction when distractors are expected to appear frequently.

Also, to make comparisons with two identical measurements from 2001 and 2007/08, and to explore potential differences related to own drug use, type of licensed premise, age or gender.Methods:Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at three time-points: 2001, 2007/08, and 2016/17, comprising employees at licensed premises in Stockholm participating in STAD's Responsible Beverage Service training program. A total of 665 persons (mean age 28 years, 53% women) were included in the 2016/2017 measurement.Results:A majority of the respondents reported having observed patrons intoxicated by illicit drugs in the last six months, and agreed that patrons intoxicated by illicit drugs should be asked to leave licensed premises. The belief that one had observed patrons intoxicated by illicit drugs was more common among respondents who had themselves been using illicit drugs during the last year, and also among employees at nightclubs. Furthermore, comparisons with previous time-points showed a significant increase in the proportion of employees using illicit drugs. Almost half of the respondents in the youngest age group (18-24 years) reported illicit drug use during the last year.Conclusions/importance: Observation and use of illicit drugs are common among employees in the Stockholm nightlife setting and has increased significantly during the past decade.

Here, we further this literature by exploring the extent to which the valence of a target's behavior influences its anthropomorphism when perceivers attempt to explain and predict that target's behavior, and the involvement of brain regions associated with explanation and prediction in such anthropomorphism. Participants viewed videos of varying visually complex agents - geometric shapes, computer generated (CG) faces, and greebles - in nonrandom motion performing harming and helping behaviors. Across two studies, participants reported a narrative that explained the observed behavior (both studies) while we recorded brain activity (study one), and participants predicted future behavior of the protagonist shapes (study two). Brain regions implicated in prediction error (striatum), not language generation (inferior frontal gyrus; IFG) engaged more to harming than helping behaviors during the anthropomorphism of such stimuli. Behaviorally, we found greater anthropomorphism in explanations of harming rather than helping behaviors, but the opposite pattern when participants predicted the agents' behavior. Together, these studies build upon the anthropomorphism literature by exploring how the valence of behavior drives explanation and prediction.

One possible mechanism is psychological flexibility, which is the ability to keep an open mind-set in order to make flexible choices adapted to the situation at hand. Methods We recruited 60 younger and 60 older adults and measured personality and well-being by questionnaires. To assess psychological flexibility we used questionnaires and a behavioral task assessing flexibility in information acquisition when making choices. Results Based on indirect effect analysis of the questionnaire data, in line with former research, our data show that in both age groups, the relationship between personality and well-being runs through psychological flexibility. Conclusion This implies that training psychological flexibility may be a promising approach to increase well-being in both older and younger adults. This effect could not be demonstrated with our choice flexibility task, thus more research is needed to uncover why this could not be measured at the behavioral level.

First, some of the risk and protective factors behind developmental challenges are suggested to be shared and some are suggested to be specific for a given condition. Second, language-based learning difficulties like dyslexia are suggested to result from or correlate with non-linguistic aspects of information processing as well. In the current study, we investigated how adults with developmental dyslexia or ADHD as well as healthy controls cluster across various dimensions designed to tap the prominent non-linguistic theories of dyslexia. Participants were 18-55-year-old adults with dyslexia (n= 36), ADHD (n= 22), and controls (n= 35). Non-linguistic theories investigated with experimental designs included temporal processing impairment, abnormal cerebellar functioning, procedural learning difficulties, as well as visual processing and attention deficits. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to investigate the emerging groups and patterns of results across these experimental designs. LPA suggested three groups: (1) a large group with average performance in the experimental designs, (2) participants predominantly from the clinical groups but with enhanced conditioning learning, and (3) participants predominantly from the dyslexia group with temporal processing as well as visual processing and attention deficits. Despite the presence of these distinct patterns, participants did not cluster very well based on their original status, nor did the LPA groups differ in their dyslexia or ADHD-related neuropsychological profiles. Remarkably, the LPA groups did differ in their intelligence. These results highlight the continuous and overlapping nature of the observed difficulties and support the multiple deficit model of developmental disorders, which suggests shared risk factors for developmental challenges. It also appears that some of the risk factors suggested by the prominent non-linguistic theories of dyslexia relate to the general level of functioning in tests of intelligence.

According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people horizontal ellipsis ) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB's evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.

The effect of changing this visual feedback in virtual reality settings is currently unknown. In this study, 19 healthy right-handed adults performed index finger movements ("action") and observed movements ("observation") with four different types of visual feedback: a simple circular cursor (CU), a point light (PL) pattern indicating finger joint positions, a shadow cartoon hand (SH) and a realistic VH. Finger movements were recorded using a data glove, and eye-tracking was recorded optically. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both action and observation conditions showed stronger fMRI signal responses in the occipitotemporal cortex compared to baseline. The action conditions additionally elicited elevated bilateral activations in motor, somatosensory, parietal, and cerebellar regions. For both conditions, feedback of a hand with a moving finger (SH, VH) led to higher activations than CU or PL feedback, specifically in early visual regions and the occipitotemporal cortex. Our results show the stronger recruitment of a network of cortical regions during visually guided finger movements with human hand feedback when compared to a visually incomplete hand and abstract feedback. This information could have implications for the design of visually guided tasks involving human body parts in both research and application or training-related paradigms.

In this study, we investigated how meditation training affects the structure of the adolescent brain by scanning a group of 38 adolescents (16.48 +/- 1.29 years) before and after participating in a 12-week meditation training. Subjects underwent Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA), a program that mainly incorporates elements from mindfulness meditation and yoga-based practices. A subset of the adolescents also received an additional control scan 12 weeks before TARA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess gray matter volume changes pre- to post-training and during the control period. Subjects showed significant gray matter (GM) volume decreases in the left posterior insula and to a lesser extent in the left thalamus and left putamen after meditation training. There were no significant changes during the control period. Our results support previous findings that meditation affects regions associated with physical and emotional awareness. However, our results are different from previous morphometric studies in which meditation was associated with structural increases. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the differences between the adolescent brain and the adult brain.

Despite increasing insight into audiovisual language processing, it remains largely unclear how integration of print and speech develops at the neural level during initial learning in the first years of schooling. To investigate this development, 32 healthy, German-speaking children at varying risk for developmental dyslexia (17 typical readers and 15 poor readers) participated in a longitudinal study including behavioral and fMRI measurements in first (T1) and second (T2) grade. We used an implicit audiovisual (AV) non-word target detection task aimed at characterizing differential activation to congruent (AVc) and incongruent (AVi) audiovisual non-word pairs. While children's brain activation did not differ between AVc and AVi pairs in first grade, an incongruency effect (AVi > AVc) emerged in bilateral inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri in second grade. Of note, pseudoword reading performance improvements with time were associated with the development of the congruency effect (AVc > AVi) in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) from first to second grade. Finally, functional connectivity analyses indicated divergent development and reading expertise dependent coupling from the left occipito-temporal and superior temporal cortex to regions of the default mode (precuneus) and fronto-temporal language networks. Our results suggest that audiovisual integration areas as well as their functional coupling to other language areas and areas of the default mode network show a different development in poor vs. typical readers at varying familial risk for dyslexia.

Currently, it is recognized that this phenomenon can occur through the neuroplasticity potential. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of motor functional reorganization in gliomas. Out of 100 consecutive patients who underwent awake surgery, 29 patients were assessed as regards their motor function and were retrospectively explored to determine whether positive motor responses were elicited. A total of 73 positive mapping sites from 27 cases were identified, and their spatial anatomical locations and activated region by functional MRI were analyzed. Additionally, the factors promoting neuroplasticity were analyzed through multiple logistic regression analysis. As a result, a total of 60 points (21 cases) were found in place, while 13 points (17.8%) were found to be shifted from anatomical localization. Reorganizations were classified into three categories: Type 1 (move to ipsilateral different gyrus) was detected at nine points (four cases), and they moved into the postcentral gyrus. Type 2 (move within the ipsilateral precentral gyrus) was detected at four points (two cases). Unknown type (two cases) was categorized as those whose motor functional cortex was moved to other regions, although we could not find the compensated motor area. Two factors for the onset of reorganization were identified: tumor cells infiltrate into the primary motor area and repeated surgery (p< 0.0001 andp= 0.0070, respectively). Our study demonstrated that compensation can occur mainly in two ways, and it promoted repeated surgery and infiltration of tumor into the primary motor area.

Recent studies suggest that microstructural change may emerge at similar timescales, but the spatiotemporal profiles of functional and structural plasticity have rarely been traced in parallel. Recently, we demonstrated that 5 days of endoscopic skill training induces changes in task-related brain activity in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and other areas of the frontoparietal grasping network. Here, we analyzed microstructural data, collected during the same experiment to investigate if microstructural plasticity overlaps temporally and spatially with the training-induced changes in task-related brain activity. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine students were divided into a full-routine group (n= 20), that underwent three endoscopy training sessions in the MR-scanner as well as a 5-day virtual reality (VR)-endoscopy training and a brief-routine group (n= 19), that only performed the in-scanner endoscopy training sessions. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were collected at baseline, after the first and after the last VR-training session. Results: The full-routine group showed significant FA changes in a left-hemispheric subcortical cluster underlying the PMv region, for which we previously demonstrated functional plasticity during endoscopy training in the same sample. Functional (task-related fMRI) and structural (FA) changes showed the largest change from the first to the second scan, suggesting similar temporal dynamics. In the full-routine group, the FA change in the subcortical cluster underlying the left PMv scaled positively with the individual improvement in endoscopic surgery. Conclusion: Microstructural white-matter plasticity mirrors the spatiotemporal profile of task-dependent plasticity during a 5-day course of endoscopy skill training. The observed similarities motivate future research on the interplay between functional and structural plasticity during early skill acquisition.

The Benefit of Cross-Modal Reorganization on Speech Perception in Pediatric Cochlear Implant Recipients Revealed Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						308	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00308			AUG 14 2020	2020	Cochlear implants (CIs) are the most successful treatment for severe-to-profound deafness in children. However, speech outcomes with a CI often lag behind those of normally-hearing children. Some authors have attributed these deficits to the takeover of the auditory temporal cortex by vision following deafness, which has prompted some clinicians to discourage the rehabilitation of pediatric CI recipients using visual speech. We studied this cross-modal activity in the temporal cortex, along with responses to auditory speech and non-speech stimuli, in experienced CI users and normally-hearing controls of school-age, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Strikingly, CI users displayed significantly greater cortical responses to visual speech, compared with controls. Importantly, in the same regions, the processing of auditory speech, compared with non-speech stimuli, did not significantly differ between the groups. This suggests that visual and auditory speech are processed synergistically in the temporal cortex of children with CIs, and they should be encouraged, rather than discouraged, to use visual speech.

This practice may produce negative consequences for some employees.Objectives: We estimate the prevalence of a set of negative consequences of work-related alcohol use and identify risk factors associated with experience of harm from coworkers' drinking.Methods:In an online survey, Norwegian employees (n = 3596) aged 20-69 reported whether they had experienced the following due to coworkers' drinking the past 12 months: (a) felt excluded, (b) experienced unwanted sexual attention, (c) been physically harmed, and (d) been verbally abused. Each outcome was regressed on socio-demographics (age, gender, education, and income), job characteristics (flexibility and autonomy), respondents' alcohol use, and perceived intoxication frequency in work contexts for a typical coworker (perceived coworker intoxication frequency).Results:The 12-month prevalence of experiencing any of the negative consequences was 18%. Having felt excluded (10.7%) and experienced unwanted sexual attention (7.0%) were more common than being verbally abused (4.8%) or physically harmed (1.9%). Perceived coworker intoxication frequency was strongly associated with all outcomes. Respondents' own drinking frequency predicted being verbally abused, being physically harmed, and experiencing unwanted sexual attention. Women experienced less physical harm and more unwanted sexual attention than men. Prevalence also varied by age, education, income, and job characteristics.Conclusions:Each year, approximately one-sixth of Norwegian employees experience harm from their coworkers' drinking. The frequency of intoxication in work contexts is strongly associated with harm to others.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 clinicians, all members of an interdisciplinary paediatric rehabilitation service, who work with children and adolescents with ABI and their families. Interview transcripts and additional data were analysed using constructivist grounded theory methods. Three main themes and sub-themes were developed: (1) Seeing the bigger picture:Goals change over time;Families set bigger picture goals;Need-to-dos: Goals that the child/adolescent needs to achieve; andWant-to-dos: Goals that the child/adolescent wants to achieve; (2) Collaborating as a team:Everyone needs to be on the same page;Hearing the child's/adolescent's voice; andParents as advocates; and (3) Recognizing and navigating challenges:Child-/adolescent- and family-related challengesandTime as a service-related challenge. Participants perceived the clinician's role during goal setting as that of an active collaborator, enabling children and adolescents with ABI and their families to generate meaningful goals. These findings demonstrate insights into goal setting in paediatric ABI neurorehabilitation from clinicians' perspectives, and highlight the importance of collaboration, flexibility and anticipation of challenges in facilitating children's, adolescents' and families' involvement in this process.

Methods: Diffusion tensor images were acquired to calculate the diffusivities in the direction of the x-axis (right-to-left; Dx), y-axis (anterior-to-posterior; Dy), and z-axis (inferior-to-superior; Dz) of the plane of the lateral ventricle body in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and 10 people in a control group. We evaluated the diffusivity along with the perivascular spaces, as well as the projection fibers and association fibers, separately. The analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS-index) was defined as the mean (Dxpro, Dypro)/mean (Dypro, Dzasc), where the Dxpro and Dxasc were the Dx values in the projection and association fiber areas, respectively. Results: There were significant differences in diffusivity along the projection fibers and the association fibers among the groups. The significant differences among the groups along the perivascular spaces, shown as the ALPS-index and medical history of T2DM, indicating lower water diffusivity along the perivascular space concerning type 2 diabetes severity, was also observed. Conclusion: Lower diffusivity along the perivascular space on DTI-APLS can reflect impairment of the glymphatic system in T2DM. This study showed that the activity of the glymphatic system could be evaluated by diffusion tensor image analysis.

The aim of this study was to assess alterations in resting-state visual networks in patients with HTG and investigate the effect of elevated IOP on the visual networks. Methods T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images were acquired from 36 HTG patients (aged 49.22 +/- 15.26 years) and 20 healthy controls (aged 49.90 +/- 5.62 years). Group independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized to evaluate altered functional connectivity (FC) in resting-state visual networks between HTG patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis between mean IOP and altered FCs in the visual networks was performed. Results ICA demonstrated decreased FCs in HTG group in the left calcarine cortex of the lateral visual network, in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the medial visual network and in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the occipital visual network compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed negative correlation between mean IOP and altered FC within the lateral visual network. Conclusion The results suggested reduced FCs between primary and higher visual cortices in HTG brain. The IOP elevation might be responsible for the functional alterations in the visual networks.

Of all the meaning units coded for model alignment, 81.7% aligned with ROSC and 18.3% with acute care. Of the meaning units coded as ROSC, 51.4% were from treatment professionals and 48.6% from probation professionals. Of the meaning units coded as acute care, 30.2% came from treatment professionals and 69.8% from probation professionals. In building a ROSC, it seems the concern is less about buy in for recovery-oriented characteristics and more about shedding characteristics of the acute-care model. Although professionals have many ideals and practices in line with the ROSC model, some acute-care characteristics linger and could continue to exist without intervention.

In this paper, we explore themes related to adjustment and identity that emerged from students' reflections about their study journey. The data for this project are drawn from a longitudinal, predominantly qualitative investigation. Twelve students (aged: 17-32 years) completed up to three in-depth interviews over a period of 4-15 months, capturing a total of 30 time points. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. A significant theme of "Is it Me or is it the Injury?" emerged from the context of students' descriptions of self, "Me" and thoughts about their injury, "The Injury." This emergent theme was indicative of the complex processes involved in adjusting and reshaping identity that arose from students' participation in education. The concepts identified in this research suggest that clinicians and educators must adopt a comprehensive, holistic and flexible approach to supporting students that can be adapted to reflect the individual and dynamic processes involved.

Eighty-one neurologically intact patients participated in this study in their sub-acute stage of recovery. Different aspects of EFs were assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Stop-Signal Test (SST) and the Digit Span Backward subtest of the WAIS-III (Span-B). Different aspects of PP were measured: Pain Disability Index (PDI), The Short-Form McGill Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Depression symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. The results indicate that irrespective of the presence of depression, mental flexibility is correlated with pain disability and pain severity (WSCT - PDI partial correlation:r= -.23;p=.047, WSCT - SF-MPQ partial correlation:r= -.31;p= .006). Response inhibition is correlated with pain disability (SST - PDI partial correlation:r= .37;p= .001). Updating was not correlated with any of the PP aspects. These results remain much the same after removing the chronic pain patients from the analyses. The present study emphasizes the multidimensional nature of the term "perceived pain", as well as the term "executive functions", and the relations between them.

Positive associations between scores on PTG measures and behavioural and functional indicators of growth would help establish the clinical utility of measuring PTG after TBI. We examined the degree of association of the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory - Short form (PTGI-SF) and Changes in Outlook Questionnaire - Short form (CiOQ-S), with (1) PTG-consistent behaviours; (2) valued living (behaving in ways consistent with one's values); and (3) post-injury functional outcomes. Participants had moderate to severe TBI and were 1-5 years post-injury (n = 70). Participants with higher scores on the CiOP-S (the positive subscale of the CiOQ-S) reported more frequent PTG-consistent behaviours post-injury, such as showing care towards family and friends, and appreciation of life. Higher CiOP-S scores were also positively associated with valued living and return to work/study. There were fewer associations between PTGI-SF scores and behavioural and functional outcomes.

The United Kingdom Rehabilitation Outcomes Collaborative (UKROC) requires neurorehabilitation services to collect data using a standardized basket of measures, but the responsiveness and usefulness of using these in the context of NbR remains unknown. Anonymous data collected at two assessments for 123 people were examined using multiple methods to determine responsiveness of four outcome measures routinely used in NbR (HoNOS-ABI, FIM + FAM UK, MPAI-4, SASNOS). Predictive validity of two measures of rehabilitation complexity (RCS-E, SRS) regarding the extent of difference scores on these outcome measures at reassessment was also determined. All four outcome measures demonstrated responsiveness, with higher levels for SASNOS and MPAI-4 when only participants categorized as "most likely to change" at first assessment were analyzed. Predictive validity of the RCS-E and SRS in estimating the extent of change was variable. SRS was only predictive of improvement on the MPAI-4 whilst RCS-E was not predictive at all. Recommendations are made regarding ideal characteristics of NbR outcome measures, along with the need to develop measures of rehabilitation complexity specifically conceptualized for these programmes.

The study design comprised a single centre, two-armed, Phase II pilot randomized controlled trial. Nineteen individuals with severe TBI (PTA >= 7 days) who met a clinical threshold for psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21; DASS > 9) were randomly allocated to either ACT-Adjust (n = 10) or an active control, Befriending Therapy (n = 9), in conjunction with a holistic rehabilitation programme. Primary (psychological flexibility, rehabilitation participation) and secondary (depression, anxiety & stress) outcomes were measured at three-time points (pre, post and follow up). Significant decreases were found for DASS-depression (group by time interaction,F-1,F-17 = 5.35,p = .03) and DASS-stress (group by time interaction,F-1,F-17 = 5.69,p = .03) in comparison to the Befriending group, but not for the primary outcome measures. The reduction in stress post-treatment was classed as clinically significant, however interaction differences for stress and depression were not maintained at one month follow up. Preliminary investigations indicate potential for ACT in decreasing psychological distress for individuals with a severe TBI with further sessions required to maintain treatment gains. The pilot results suggest further investigation is warranted in a larger scale clinical trial.

For those who sustain traumatic brain injury (TBI), life is frequently characterized by declining interpersonal relationships. The aim of this study was to understand the post-injury experience of friendship from the perspective of adults with severe TBI. Participants were 23 adults who had sustained severe TBI on average 10 years earlier; the majority was between 25 and 45 years old. The experience of friendship was explored using a convergent mixed methods design (quantitative self-report measures and in-depth interviews). Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts employed open and focussed coding to reveal themes and categories. Participants nominated on average 3.35 (SD 2.19) friends. When paid carers and family members were excluded, the mean dropped to 1.52 (SD 1.38). Exploratory correlations between number of friends and quality of life, depression and strong-tie support revealed significant associations of moderate to large effects. The post-injury experience of friendship was broadly conceptualized as "going downhill" with four overlapping phases:losing contact, being misunderstood, wanting to shareandhanging on. Participants' stories illustrated how rehabilitation can focus on friendship by supporting established relationships and facilitating access to activities that afford interpersonal encounters and opportunities to share experiences.

The aims of this study were to: (1) describe the executive processes affected in MS, using a top-down (Weekly Calendar Planning Activity; WCPA) and bottom-up (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System; DKEFS) assessment tools; (2) explore relationships between performance on the WCPA and DKEFS with a test of everyday functional performance, Actual Reality (TM)(AR). Methods: Sixty two participants with MS with and without cognitive impairments (n = 21 and 41, respectively) and 38 Healthy Controls (HC) completed the WCPA, two selected subtests of the DKEFS, and AR. Results: The MS group with cognitive impairments performed worse compared with the MS with no cognitive impairments and HC on both the WCPA and DKEFS. Better scores on the DKEFS were associated with better performance of the WCPA. WCPA was a significant predictor of three of the four AR variables. The DKEFS was a significant predictor of time to perform the AR. The results support the use of the WCPA as an assessment of executive functions in persons with MS. It embodies processes such as environmental monitoring, planning and problem solving, and self-regulation.

In this context, new technologies have the potential to enable people with PPA to improve their communication skills. The main aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a self-administered therapy using a smart tablet to improve naming of functional words and to assess generalization to an ecological conversation task. Five adults with PPA completed the protocol. Using an ABA design with multiple baselines, naming performance was compared across four equivalent lists: (1) trained with functional words; (2) trained with words from a picture database; (3) exposed but not trained; and (4) not exposed (control). Treatment was self-administered four times a week for a period of four consecutive weeks. A significant improvement for trained words was found in all five participants, and gains were maintained two months post-treatment in four of them. Moreover, in three participants, evidence of generalization was found in conversation. This study supports the efficacy of using a smart tablet to improve naming in PPA and suggests the possibility of generalization to an ecological context.

This study aimed to determine the effect of acupressure on dynamic balance in elderly women. Methods This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 72 elderly women in Qazvin, Iran. The intervention group received rotary massage using the thumb at the pressure points for 4 weeks, 3 times a week for 20 minutes each session. Dynamic balance in both groups was measured before, 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention using timed up and go test and the step test. Data were analyzed using two way repeated measures ANOVA. Results The mean age of participants was 67.34 +/- 6.30 with a range of 60 to 80 years old. The results showed statistically significant improvement in the dynamic balance quantified by timed up and go test (%Delta = 26.53) and step test for the right (%Delta = 35.22) and left (Delta% = 32.62) legs (p< .001). However, in the control group, no significant change was observed in the dynamic balance after completion of the program. Conclusion The results support that acupressure therapy can be an effective, safe, and inexpensive method to improve the dynamic balance and maintain maximum autonomy of the elderly.

Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) might influence the association between CAN and PTSD. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between CAN and PTSD symptom severity in women with SUD and to investigate the mediating role of general difficulties in ER and its specific dimensions.Method:We examined 320 women, with a current diagnosis of at least subsyndromal PTSD and SUD, using self-report measures of CAN, PTSD symptom severity, and ER difficulties. We conducted both simple and multiple bootstrapping-enhanced mediation analysis to investigate whether general difficulties in ER and its specific dimensions mediate the relationship between CAN and PTSD symptom severity.Results:General difficulties in ER mediated the association between CAN and PTSD symptom severity. CAN significantly predicted adult PTSD symptom severity, directly and indirectly, through ER difficulties.Difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior when distressedwas the only ER dimension, which mediated the effect of CAN on PTSD symptoms.Conclusions:Our results suggest that difficulties in ER and specificallydifficulties engaging in goal directed behavior when distressedmight constitute an influential factor in the relationship between CAN and PTSD symptom severity in a sample of SUD patients, and highlight the importance of targeting ER as a potential treatment focus for patients with comorbid PTSD and SUD.

Neural Field Theory of Evoked Response Potentials With Attentional Gain Dynamics								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						293	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00293			AUG 7 2020	2020	A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.

J	Duffau, Hugues								What Direct Electrostimulation of the Brain Taught Us About the Human Connectome: A Three-Level Model of Neural Disruption								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						315	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00315			AUG 7 2020	2020	For a long time, the relevance of the information provided by direct electrostimulation (DES) for mapping brain functions was debated. Recently, major advances in intraoperative DES for guiding resection of cerebral tumors in awake patients enabled the validation of this method and its increased utilization in basic neurosciences. Indeed, in addition to the cortical stimulation used for many decades in epilepsy surgery, axonal mapping was developed thanks to DES of the white matter tracts, giving original insights into the neural connectivity. Moreover, functional results collected during intrasurgical mapping have been correlated with neuropsychological performances before and after DES-guided resection, and with perioperative neuroimaging data. Thus, it was evidenced that DES offers the unique opportunity to identify both cortical and subcortical structurescriticalfor cerebral functions. Here, the first aim is to propose a three-level model of DES-generated functional disruption, able to explain the behavioral consequences elicited during awake surgery, i.e., (i) DES of an input/output unimodal (e.g., somatosensory or motor) network inducing "positive" responses (as involuntary movement); (ii) DES of a distributed specialized network inducing a within-system disruption leading to specific "negative" disorders (e.g., exclusive language deficit with no other disorders); (iii) DES generating an inter-system disruption leading to more complex behavioral disturbances (e.g., the inability to perform dual-task while each function can be performed separately). Second, in light of this model, original findings gained from DES concerning the human connectome, complementary to those provided by functional neuroimaging (FNI), are reviewed. Further longitudinal multimodal investigations are needed to explore neuroplasticity mechanisms.

The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with fatigue among older adults living in a rest home. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out with a total of 92 older adults. Fatigue was evaluated by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The sociodemographic characteristics, quadriceps and handgrip strength, functional capacity and physical function were assessed using a structured questionnaire, digital dynamometers, 6-minute walking test and Short Physical Performance Battery, respectively. Results The prevalence of fatigue was 67.4%. FSS showed significant correlations with age, female gender, body mass index, physical activity habits, quadriceps strength, handgrip strength, functional exercise capacity, and physical function. However, in the regression analysis, only body mass index, physical activity habits and physical function were responsible for 51% of the variance in fatigue among rest home residents. Physical activity habits and physical function were the best predictors of fatigue explaining 47.5% of variance. Conclusion This study demonstrated that body mass index, physical activity habits and physical function contributed to fatigue in rest home residents. These factors can be used to identify individuals at high risk of fatigue and to attenuate fatigue levels.

Moreover, despite its low prevalence, the number of individuals with GHB-use disorders is steadily increasing. However, the risk-factors associated with chronic GHB-use or the development of a GHB-use disorders remain poorly understood.Purpose:This study aims to profile two types of GHB-users, those with and those without GHB-induced comas.Methods:We included 27 GHB users with >= 4 GHB-induced comas (GHB-Coma), 27 GHB users without a coma (GHB-NoComa), and 27 polydrug users who never used GHB (No-GHB). Participants completed self-reported questionnaires in order to assess their demographic and clinical features, and their use profile of GHB and other drugs.Results:The typical GHB user in our sample was young, single, living alone, well-educated, and a student. The GHB-Coma group had lower self-control and reported higher negative affect than the GHB-NoComa group. GHB-Coma participants were heavier GHB users and mostly used GHB alone at home, whereas the GHB-NoComa group mostly used GHB with friends and in nightclubs. Remarkably, the majority of participants were not concerned about potential neurocognitive impairments induced by GHB-intoxication and/or GHB-induced comas.Conclusion: In this assessment, different profiles for recreational users with and without GHB-induced comas were well expressed. Their description contributes to a better understanding of the risk factors associated with recreational GHB-use, GHB-induced coma, and the development of GHB-use disorders.

Methods: There were four phases: (1) review the literature of drug dependence measurement; (2) formulate an item list to be assessed by experts; (3) pretest our item list in two substance dependence treatment centers; and (4) field-test and conduct psychometric performance analysis with the final item bank. Additionally, based on our response data, a CAT simulation was used to validate the item bank, Drug Dependence CAT (DD-CAT).Results:The final drug dependence item bank - with a unidimensional configuration - contained 56 items with good item-fit, high discrimination, no differential item functioning, and covered all symptoms of diagnostic criteria for drug dependence. These results revealed that the final item bank was of good quality. Additionally, the results of a simulation CAT procedure with real response data indicated that the DD-CAT item bank exhibited acceptable and reasonable test reliability, content validity, and criterion-related validity.Conclusions/Importance:The proposed item bank for DD-CAT contained acceptable reliability and validity, and exhibited a shorter but efficient assessment of drug dependence.

J	Lee, Minji; Yoon, Jae-Geun; Lee, Seong-Whan								Predicting Motor Imagery Performance From Resting-State EEG Using Dynamic Causal Modeling								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						321	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00321			AUG 6 2020	2020	Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines-but does not perform-a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as "BCI-inefficiency," in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1:r= 0.54; Session 2:r= 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared= 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time.

The impact of self-control training on neural responses following anger provocation								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	5			558	570		10.1080/17470919.2020.1799860			SEP 2 2020	2020	Self-control training (SCT) is one way to enhance self-controlled behavior. We conducted a novel and exploratory functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to examine how SCT affects neural responses in a situation that elicits a self-control response: anger provocation. Forty-five healthy young men and women completed two-weeks of SCT or a behavioral monitoring task and were then insulted during scanning. We found significant changes in functional activation and connectivity using a lenient error threshold, which were not observed using a stricter threshold. Activation in the posterior insula was greater for the control compared to the SCT group at post-provocation, trait aggression correlated with neural responses to SCT, and SCT was associated with specific amygdala-cortical connections. Neural changes occurred even though SCT did not affect participants' performance on an inhibition task, reports of trying to control their anger, or their experience of anger. This dissociation prevented clear interpretation about whether the neural changes were indicative of specific anger or anger control processes. Although replication with high-powered studies is needed, we provide evidence that SCT affects neural responses in the context of anger provocation.

However, experimental settings consisting of various tasks are particularly strenuous for patients and can thus result in poor data quality. For the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition, this study aims to validate a combinedn-back/nogo paradigm by comparing it to single task versions and to demonstrate its applicability for ADHD research. Twenty-five healthy individuals and 34 ADHD patients between 9 and 16 years participated in this event-related potential (ERP) study. Healthy controls underwent single task versions of a 2-back working memory task and a go/nogo response inhibition task as well as the introduced combined 2-back/nogo task. This combined task demonstrated a comparable ERP structure for working memory and response inhibition aspects as single task versions. Behaviorally, higher working memory performance during the combined paradigm indicated lower task difficulty, while high correlations between combined and single task versions still indicated valid working memory measures. For response inhibition performance, different task versions resulted in similar outcomes. The application of the combinedn-back/nogo paradigm in ADHD patients revealed the expected working memory and response inhibition deficits, increased omission errors, reaction times, and standard deviation of reaction time, as well as diminishedn-back P3 and nogo P3 amplitudes. We conclude that the combinedn-back/nogo task is an effective paradigm for the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition deficits in ADHD on a behavioral and neurophysiological level.

A possible explanation may be that different ToM components and types of inference have not systematically been considered. This study examined the effect of aging on ToM by assessing both first and second order cognitive and affective components within a single task. Methods We compared performance of young (M= 18.3y) and older adults (M= 61.0y) on the Yoni task. This task allows for a within-subject assessment of both first and second order cognitive and affective ToM. Results We observed that older adults had longer reaction times than young adults across cognitive and affective first order items. For second order items, this age difference was larger for affective than cognitive items. Results showed no indications that these findings could be explained by age differences in speed/accuracy trade-offs. Conclusion Our findings suggest that decision processes underlying ToM are slower in older adults on both first and second order inferences, but that age differences in these processes between cognitive and affective ToM are selective to second order inferences. We propose that the observed age differences may be associated with cortical and mental changes that occur with aging.		[Ruitenberg, Marit F.

J	Hill, Christopher M.; Stringer, Mason; Waddell, Dwight E.; Del Arco, Alberto								Punishment Feedback Impairs Memory and Changes Cortical Feedback-Related Potentials During Motor Learning								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						294	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00294			AUG 5 2020	2020	Reward and punishment have demonstrated dissociable effects on motor learning and memory, which suggests that these reinforcers are differently processed by the brain. To test this possibility, we use electroencephalography to record cortical neural activity after the presentation of reward and punishment feedback during a visuomotor rotation task. Participants were randomly placed into Reward, Punishment, or Control groups and performed the task under different conditions to assess the adaptation (learning) and retention (memory) of the motor task. These conditions featured an incongruent position between the cursor and the target, with the cursor trajectory, rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise, requiring the participant to adapt their movement to hit the target. Feedback based on error magnitude was provided during the Adaptation condition in the form of a positive number (Reward) or negative number (Punishment), each representing a monetary gain or loss, respectively. No reinforcement or visual feedback was provided during the No Vision condition (retention). Performance error and event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to feedback presentation were calculated for each participant during both conditions. Punishment feedback reduced performance error and promoted faster learning during the Adaptation condition. In contrast, punishment feedback increased performance error during the No Vision condition compared to Control and Reward groups, which suggests a diminished motor memory. Moreover, the Punishment group showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of ERPs during the No Vision condition compared to the Adaptation condition. The amplitude of ERPs did not change in the other two groups. These results suggest that punishment feedback impairs motor retention by altering the neural processing involved in memory encoding. This study provides a neurophysiological underpinning for the dissociative effects of punishment feedback on motor learning.

Methods:Web of Science was used to collect bibliographic data of traumatic brain injury rehabilitation documents from 1983 until the end of 2017. Results:Of a total of 6069 documents retrieved, 78.2% were journal articles. The average annual growth of the documents as of the year 2000 was 9.4%. The most frequent subject categories in this field were Rehabilitation, Neurosciences and Neurology, Sport Sciences, Psychology, and General and Internal Medicine. The most active journal was Brain Injury. More than 50% of the documents were published in 10 journals. The most prolific and impactful institutions were from the USA, Australia and Canada. Traumatic brain injury, rehabilitation, brain injury, stroke and outcome were the most commonly used keywords. Mild traumatic brain injury and concussion were the topics receiving attention in recent years. Conclusion:Traumatic brain injury rehabilitation is a young and constantly growing field. Since the late 1990s, traumatic brain injury rehabilitation documents published yearly comprised about 3-4% of all rehabilitation documents. It was shown that review papers and proceedings have more impact than journal articles, and collaborative papers receive more citations. It was also revealed that knowledge does not become obsolete rapidly in this field.

We also assessed the relationship of these with psychological indicators. Method: We extracted 78 occupations from the ADOC in consideration of the subjects' age, and three conditions were set: (1) self-selection of an interesting occupation; (2) self-selection of a disliked occupation; and (3) forced selection. The RT task was executed under their conditions during which ERP was measured. We compared the P300 component of ERP in these conditions. Moreover, we examined the association of cognitive processing and degree of satisfaction and performance concerning occupation, with psychological indicators. Results: P300 amplitude at Fz significantly increased in the self-selection of an interesting occupation. P300 amplitude at Pz was significantly positively correlated with the occupational satisfaction score. Conclusion: Self-selection of interesting occupations in the ADOC resulted in increased attention resource allocation by increasing motivation. Further, there was a positive correlation between satisfaction concerning the occupation and attention of resource allocation. Therefore, occupational therapists should know which occupations the patients consider interesting and help them to select by themselves, thus enhancing their satisfaction after consultation. These interventions may contribute to promoting motivation and cognitive processing.

Outcomes were assessed at baseline, weeks 8 and 16, and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Economic analyses took into account the costs of services received and work/social role impairment.Results:In the context of almost identical efficacy, a form of CCBT that used only about one third the amount of therapist contact as conventional CBT was highly cost-effective compared to conventional therapy and reduced the adjusted cost of treatment by USD 945 per patient.Conclusions:A method of CCBT that blended internet-delivered modules and abbreviated therapeutic contact reduced the cost of treatment substantially without adversely affecting outcomes. Results suggest that use of this approach can more than double the access to CBT. Because clinician support in CCBT can be provided by telephone, videoconference, and/or email, this highly efficient form of treatment could be a major advance in remote treatment delivery.

Probing the mechanisms of probe-mediated binocular rivalry								VISION RESEARCH				173				21	28		10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.011			AUG 2020	2020	Binocular rivalry occurs when incompatible images are presented simultaneously but separately to each eye. Perceptual dominance reverses over time such that one image temporarily dominates perception, while the other image is suppressed. Prior research has shown that briefly-presented probes modulate perception such that probes presented to the suppressed eye tend to produce shorter percept durations relative to when probes are presented to the dominant eye. This pattern suggests that probes strengthen the competitive strength of the image over which they appear. However, it remains unclear whether probe-modulated effects on binocular rivalry are equivalent across the visual field, in particular as a function of whether probes appear within the region of interocular conflict (i.e on-object) or outside the region of interocular conflict (i.e. off-object). We tested this by manipulating whether probes appeared on-object or off-object. We replicate prior work showing that suppressed-eye probes produce shorter percept durations relative to dominant-eye probes. Critically, however, we show that percept duration also varies as a function of whether probes appear on vs. off the rivalry objects; that is, differences in percept duration between suppressed-eye and dominant-eye probes were much larger for on-object than off-object probes. Importantly, however, the difference between suppressed-eye and dominant-eye probes was still significant for off-object probes.

J	Wang, Mengxin; McGraw, Paul; Ledgeway, Timothy								Short-term monocular deprivation reduces inter-ocular suppression of the deprived eye								VISION RESEARCH				173				29	40		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.001			AUG 2020	2020	The adult visual system was traditionally thought to be relatively hard-wired, but recent studies have challenged this view by demonstrating plasticity following short-term monocular deprivation. Depriving one eye of spatial information for 2-3 h increased subsequent sensory dominance of that eye. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. The present study sought to address this issue and determine the consequences of short-term monocular deprivation on inter-ocular suppression of each eye. Sensory eye dominance was examined before and after depriving an eye of all input using an opaque patch for 2.5 h, in six adult participants with normal binocular vision. We used a percept tracking task during binocular rivalry (BR) to assess the relative eye dominance, and an objective probe detection task under continuous flash suppression (CFS) to quantify each eye's susceptibility to inter-ocular suppression. The monocular contrast increment threshold of each eye was also measured using the probe task to ascertain if the altered eye dominance is accompanied by changes in monocular perception. Our BR results replicated previous findings of a shift of relative dominance towards the eye that has been deprived of form information. More crucially, using CFS we demonstrated reduced inter-ocular suppression of the deprived eye with no complementary changes in the other eye, and no monocular changes in increment threshold. These findings imply that short-term monocular deprivation alters binocular interactions. The differential effect on inter-ocular suppression between eyes may have important implications for the use of patching as a therapy to recover visual function in amblyopia.

Elucidating the phenomenon's underlying mechanisms is relevant for the larger question of how the visual system makes photometric judgments in images. Accounts over the past century have spanned low-, mid- and high-level visual processes, but a definitive resolution has not emerged. We present three studies that collectively demonstrate that the computations underlying this phenomenon are low-level, instantiated prior to binocular fusion, and available innately, without need for inferential learning via an individual's visual experience. In our first two studies, we find that strong brightness induction is obtained even when observers are unaware of any luminance differences in the neighborhoods of the probe patches. Results with dichoptic displays reveal that eye of origin, although not evident consciously, has a marked influence on the eventual brightness percept of the probe patches, thereby localizing brightness estimation to a site preceding binocular fusion. The third study uses conventional simultaneous brightness contrast displays, but an unusual group of participants: Congenitally blind children whom we were able to treat surgically. The results demonstrate an immediate susceptibility to the simultaneous brightness illusion after sight onset. Together, these data strongly constrain the search for mechanisms underlying a fundamental brightness phenomenon.

J	Gawne, Timothy J.; Norton, Thomas T.								An opponent dual-detector spectral drive model of emmetropization								VISION RESEARCH				173				7	20		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.011			AUG 2020	2020	In post-natal developing eyes a feedback mechanism uses optical cues to regulate axial growth so as to achieve good focus, a process termed emmetropization. However, the optical cues that the feedback mechanism uses have remained unclear. Here we present evidence that a primary visual cue may be the detection of different image statistics by the short-wavelength sensitive (SWS) and long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone photoreceptors, caused by longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA). We use as a model system the northern tree shrew Tupaia belangeri, diurnal cone-dominated dichromatic mammals closely related to primates. We present an optical model in which the SWS and LWS photoreceptors each represent an image at different levels of defocus. The model posits that an imbalance between SWS and LWS image statistics directs eye growth towards the point at which these image statistics are in balance. Under spectrally broadband ("while") lighting, the focus of the eye is driven to a target point approximately in the middle of the visible spectrum, which is emmetropia. Calculations suggest that the SWS cone array, despite the sparse number of SWS cones, can plausibly detect the wavelength-dependent differences in defocus and guide refractive development. The model is consistent with the effects of various narrow-band illuminants on emmetropization in tree shrews. Simulations suggest that common artificial light spectra do not interfere with emmetropization. Simulations also suggest that multi-spectral multifocal lenses, where the different optical zones of a multifocal lens have different spectral filtering properties, could be an anti-myopia intervention.

Although previous studies have reported that presaccadically acquired visual information influences postsaccadic perception, whether such information's priority to access visual awareness is either reset by each saccade or continuous across saccades remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we combined a breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS) with a saccade task. Before each saccade, a grating was presented in the peripheral visual field under suppression. After the saccade, the same grating was again presented under suppression at either the retinotopically matched, the spatiotopically matched, or a control location. By measuring the duration of the grating to break through CFS into awareness after a saccade, we could compare the breakthrough times across stimuli presented at the different locations. No difference in the reaction times between the spatiotopic and control location was observed, indicating that a saccade resets the buildup of an object's priority to access visual awareness. However, a longer breakthrough time was observed for the retinotopic as compared to the control location, suggesting that a form of retinotopic adaptation to the grating suppressed the priority to access visual awareness after a saccade.

J	Wang, Xiaoye Michael; Lind, Mats; Bingham, Geoffrey P.								A stratified process for the perception of objects: From optical transformations to 3D relief structure to 3D similarity structure to slant or aspect ratio								VISION RESEARCH				173				77	89		10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.014			AUG 2020	2020	Previously, we developed a stratified process for slant perception. First, optical transformations in structure-from-motion (SFM) and stereo were used to derive 3D relief structure (where depth scaling remains arbitrary). Second, with sufficient continuous perspective change (>= 45 degrees), a bootstrap process derived 3D similarity structure. Third, the perceived slant was derived. As predicted by theoretical work on SFM, small visual angle (< 5 degrees) viewing requires non-coplanar points. Slanted surfaces with small 3D cuboids or tetrahedrons yielded accurate judgment while planar surfaces did not. Normally, object perception entails non-coplanar points. Now, we apply the stratified process to object perception where, after deriving similarity structure, alternative metric properties of the object can be derived (e.g. slant of the top surface or width-to-depth aspect ratio). First, we tested slant judgments of the smooth planar tops of three different polyhedral objects. We tested rectangular, hexagonal, and asymmetric pentagonal surfaces, finding that symmetry was required to determine the direction of slant (AP&P, 2019, https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-019-01859-5). Our current results replicated the previous findings. Second, we tested judgments of aspect ratios, finding accurate performance only for symmetric objects. Results from this study suggest that, first, trackable non-coplanar points can be attained in the form of 3D objects. Second, symmetry is necessary to constrain slant and aspect ratio perception. Finally, deriving 3D similarity structure precedes estimating object properties, such as slant or aspect ratio. Together, evidence presented here supports the stratified bootstrap process for 3D object perception. Statement of significance: Planning interactions with objects in the surrounding environment entails the perception of 3D shape and slant. Studying ways through which 3D metric shape and slant can be perceived accurately by moving observers not only sheds light on how the visual system works, but also provides understanding that can be applied to other fields, like machine vision or remote sensing. The current study is a logical extension of previous studies by the same authors and explores the roles of large continuous perspective changes, relief structure, and symmetry in a stratified process for object perception.

Visual discomfort from flicker: Effects of mean light level and contrast								VISION RESEARCH				173				50	60		10.1016/j.visres.2020.05.002			AUG 2020	2020	Uncomfortable images generally have a particular spatial structure, which deviates from a reciprocal relationship between amplitude and spatial frequency (f) in the Fourier domain (1/f). Although flickering patterns with similar temporal structure also appear uncomfortable, the discomfort is affected by not only the amplitude spectrum but also the phase spectrum. Here we examined how discomfort from flicker with differing temporal profiles also varies as a function of the mean light level and luminance contrast of the stimulus. Participants were asked to rate discomfort for a 17 degrees flickering uniform field at different light levels from scotopic to photopic. The flicker waveform was varied with a square wave or random phase spectrum and filtered by modulating the slope of the amplitude spectrum relative to 1/f. At photopic levels, the 1/f square wave flicker appeared most comfortable, whereas the discomfort from the random flicker increased monotonically as the slope of the amplitude spectrum decreased. This special status for the 1/f square wave condition was limited to photopic light levels. At the lower mesopic or scotopic levels, the effect of phase spectrum on the discomfort was diminished, with both phase spectra showing a monotonic change with the slope of the amplitude spectrum. We show that these changes cannot be accounted for by changes in the effective luminance contrast of the stimuli or by the responses from a linear model based on the temporal impulse responses under different light levels. However, discomfort from flicker is robustly correlated with judgments of the perceived naturalness of flicker across different contrasts and mean luminance levels.

A comparable level of complexity also emerges in deep neural networks (DNNs) while exhibiting human-level performance in demanding visual tasks. Unlike in biological systems, all parameters and operations of DNNs are accessible. Therefore, in theory, it should be possible to decipher the exact mechanisms learnt by these artificial networks. Here, we investigate the concept of contrast invariance within the framework of DNNs. We start by discussing how a network can achieve robustness to changes in local and global image contrast. We used a technique from neuroscience-"kernel lesion"-to measure the degree of performance degradation when individual kernels are eliminated from a network. We further compared contrast normalisation, a mechanism used in biological systems, to the strategies that DNNs learn to cope with changes of contrast. The results of our analysis suggest that (i) contrast is a low-level feature for these networks, and it is encoded in the shallow layers; (ii) a handful of kernels appear to have a greater impact on this feature, and their removal causes a substantially larger accuracy loss for low-contrast images; (iii) edges are a distinct visual feature within the internal representation of object classification DNNs.

J	Liu, Shuang; Wang, Wei; Sheng, Yue; Zhang, Ludan; Xu, Minpeng; Ming, Dong								Improving the Cross-Subject Performance of the ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interface Using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation and Correlation Analysis Rank								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						296	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00296			JUL 31 2020	2020	The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that is designed to provide communication channels to anyone through a computer. Initially, it was suggested to help the disabled, but actually had been proposed a wider range of applications. However, the cross-subject recognition in BCI systems is difficult to break apart from the individual specific characteristics, unsteady characteristics, and environmental specific characteristics, which also makes it difficult to develop highly reliable and highly stable BCI systems. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is one of the most recent spellers with a clean, unified background and a single stimulus, which may evoke event-related potential (ERP) patterns with less individual difference. In order to build a BCI system that allows new users to use it directly without calibration or with less calibration time, RSVP was employed as evoked paradigm, then correlation analysis rank (CAR) algorithm was proposed to improve the cross-individual classification and simultaneously use as less training data as possible. Fifty-eight subjects took part in the experiments. The flash stimulation time is 200 ms, and the off time is 100 ms. The P300 component was locked to the target representation by time. The results showed that RSVP could evoke more similar ERP patterns among subjects compared with matrix paradigm. Then, the included angle cosine was calculated and counted for averaged ERP waveform between each two subjects. The average matching number of all subjects was 6 for the matrix paradigm, while for the RSVP paradigm, the average matching number range was 20 when the threshold value was set to 0.5, more than three times as much larger, quantificationally indicating that ERP waveforms evoked by the RSVP paradigm produced smaller individual differences, and it is more favorable for cross-subject classification. Information transfer rates (ITR) were also calculated for RSVP and matrix paradigms, and the RSVP paradigm got the average ITR of 43.18 bits/min, which was 13% higher than the matrix paradigm. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was computed and compared using the proposed CAR algorithm and traditional random selection. The results showed that the proposed CAR got significantly better performance than the traditional random selection and got the best AUC value of 0.8, while the traditional random selection only achieved 0.65. These encouraging results suggest that with proper evoked paradigm and classification methods, it is feasible to get stable performance across subjects for ERP-based BCI. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.

This study aimed to explore the anti-fatigue performance of six stimulus paradigms (reverse vertical sinusoidal gratings, reverse horizontal sinusoidal gratings, reverse vertical square-wave gratings, brief-onset vertical sinusoidal gratings, reversal checkerboards, and oscillating expansion-contraction concentric rings) in SSVEP acuity assessment. Methods Based on four indices of alpha + theta index, pupil diameter, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs, this study quantitatively evaluated mental fatigue in six SSVEP visual attention runs corresponding to six paradigms with 12 subjects. Results These indices of mental fatigue showed a good agreement. The results showed that the paradigm of motion expansion-contraction concentric rings had a superior anti-fatigue efficacy than the other five paradigms of conventional onset mode or pattern reversal mode during prolonged SSVEP experiment. The paradigm of brief-onset mode showed the lowest anti-fatigue efficacy, and the other paradigms of pattern reversal SSVEP paradigms showed a similar anti-fatigue efficacy, which was between motion expansion-contraction mode and onset mode. Conclusion This study recommended the paradigm of oscillating expansion-contraction concentric rings as the stimulation paradigm in SSVEP visual acuity because of its superior anti-fatigue efficacy.

The current study explores whether different types of objects' characteristics may elicit different types of spatial compatibility, that is, handle-response and response-effect compatibility as well as their potential interaction. In Experiment 1, objects having a graspable handle opposite to either a visible functional component (i.e.,handle-function objects: a teapot) or a latent functional component (handle-only objects: a pitcher lacking the spout) were presented separately in different blocks. Both the handle and the goal-directed functional components of these objects were located on the horizontal axis. In Experiment 2, handle-only objects had a handle located on the horizontal axis and a latent functional component located on the vertical axis (e.g., a cup). In both experiments, participants were required to judge the material (plastic and metal) the object was made of. Results showed that the handle-response compatibility effect was sensitive to whether the actions consequences of object manipulation took place on the horizontal rather than on the vertical axis.

Objectives This study aimed to characterize risk correlates of prescription stimulant misuse among a racially-diverse and socioeconomically-disadvantaged sample of urban adolescents. Method Cross-sectional data were drawn from an ongoing study of adolescent health behaviors,Project Teen. Participants were 414 9(th)to 11(th)graders (M-age=16.00 [SD = 1.08]; 57% female; 41% Black or African American, 22% White, 18% Asian, 17% Multiracial, 2% Pacific Islander, and 1% Native American; 12% Hispanic/Latinx). Participants completed a web-based survey assessing prescription stimulant misuse, demographics, mental health and personality, social environment, and substance use. Results Eight percent of participants endorsed past-year prescription stimulant misuse. Compared to non-misusing peers, participants endorsing past-year prescription stimulant misuse reported greater depression/anxiety symptoms, sensation seeking, perceived peer risk behavior, and alcohol and cigarette use, as well as a lower level of parental monitoring; null group differences were observed for academic goal orientation, perceived peer approval of risk behavior, and cannabis use. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that binge drinking and cigarette use were significantly associated with prescription stimulant misuse over and above all other identified risk variables. Conclusions Adolescent prescription stimulant misuse appears to overlap with general adolescent substance use, sharing several known risk correlates. Results highlight potential targets for identification of emerging prescription stimulant misuse risk profiles at earlier stages of development. Longitudinal replication is needed to examine directional associations and risk mechanisms underlying adolescent prescription stimulant misuse.

This study investigated anatomic- and task-dependent differences in intermuscular coherence (IMC) and their association with the parameters of jaw muscle activity using surface electromyography (sEMG). Methods We recorded sEMG activation from bilateral and ipsilateral jaw-closing muscle pairs during non-nutritive and nutritive chewing, and during a syllable repetition task. IMC and cross-correlational analyses between bilateral and ipsilateral muscle pairs were performed. Results Intermuscular coherence in the beta band was statistically significant between agonist jaw-closing muscle pairs, with beta IMC weaker for rapid syllable repetition compared to chewing tasks. Cross-correlational analysis of muscle co-activation, as well as sEMG burst amplitude, was positively associated with beta IMC strength. Discussion Beta IMC was influenced heavily by task-dependent behavioral goals and physiologic demands, which was interpreted as evidence of shared neural drive among jaw-closing muscles.

(2017)used between-subjects Latin square block design for backgrounds; therefore, participants could not get comparable scores. The current study used within-subject pseudorandom design for backgrounds to improve EMERT to PREMERT (pseudorandom EMERT) and used eyes-closed and eyes-open resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect relevant brain activity of PREMERT for the first time. The results showed (1) two new recapitulative indexes of PREMERT were adopted, such as microexpression M and microexpression SD. Using pseudorandom design, the participants could effectively identify almost all the microexpressions, and each microexpression type had significant background effect. The PREMERT had good split-half reliability, parallel-forms reliability, criterion validity, and ecological validity. Therefore, it could stably and efficiently detect the participants' microexpression recognition abilities. Because of its pseudorandom design, all participants did the same test; their scores could be compared with each other. (2) amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF; 0.01-0.1 Hz) in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states and ALFF difference could predict microexpression M, and the ALFF difference was less predictive. The relevant resting-state brain areas of microexpression M were some frontal lobes, insula, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, precuneus, thalamus, putamen, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. (3) ALFFs in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states and ALFF difference could predict microexpression SD, and the ALFF difference was more predictive. The relevant resting-state brain areas of microexpression SD were some frontal lobes, central anterior gyrus, supplementary motor area, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, cuneus, occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. (4) There were many similar relevant resting-state brain areas, such as brain areas of expression recognition, microexpressions consciousness and attention, and the change from expression backgrounds to microexpression, and some different relevant resting-state brain areas, such as precuneus, insula, and pallidum, between microexpression M and SD. The ALFF difference was more sensitive to PREMERT fluctuations.

Recent EEG-based hyperscanning studies reveal that cooperative and competitive interactions induce an increase in interbrain coupling. However, whether this interbrain coupling effect is just a reflection of inter-subject motor coordination or can also signal the type of social interaction is unknown. Here, we show that behavioral coordination and social interaction type can be distinguished according to the frequency of oscillation in which the brains are coupled. We use EEG to simultaneously measure the brain activity of pairs of subjects, while they were performing a visual cue-target task in a cooperative and competitive manner. Behavioral responses were quasi-simultaneous between subject pairs for both competitive and cooperative conditions, with faster average response times for the competitive condition. Concerning brain activity, we found increased interbrain coupling in theta band (3-7 Hz) during cooperation and competition, with stronger coupling during competitive interactions. This increase of interbrain theta coupling correlated with a decrease in reaction times of the dyads. Interestingly, we also found an increase in brain-to-brain coupling in gamma band (38-42 Hz) only during cooperative interactions. Unlike the theta coupling effect, the gamma interbrain coupling did not correlate with dyads' reaction times. Taken together, these results suggest that theta interbrain coupling could be linked to motor coordination processes common to cooperative and competitive interactions, while gamma brain-to-brain coupling emerges as an electrophysiological marker of shared intentionality during cooperative interactions.

Access and Barriers to Take-Home Naloxone Use among Emergency Department Patients with Opioid Misuse in Baltimore, Maryland, USA								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	13			2237	2242		10.1080/10826084.2020.1797811			OCT 1 2020	2020	Background The opioid epidemic has prompted the expansion of take-home naloxone (THN) distribution programs. The proportion of emergency department (ED) patients with opioid misuse who have access to a naloxone kit (NK) and barriers to using it are unclear.Objective:Characterizing the access and barrier to NK use among at-risk ED patients.Methods:We enrolled a convenience sample of ED patients with active opioid misuse from May 21-July 31, 2018. We administered a survey to collect patients' demographic data, substance use history, and access to and use of NK. The primary outcome was NK access (prior receipt of a kit or prescription); secondary outcomes were knowledge and use of NK, and barriers to obtaining and using it.Results:Of 165 respondents, 71.5% knew of THN programs and 57.6% (n = 95) had access to THN by either having received a NK (n = 90) or a prescription (n = 5); 34 respondents received both. Among 39 (23.6%) who received a naloxone prescription, 25 (64.1%) filled it. 60.0% (n = 99) reported knowing how to administer naloxone; lack of training was the primary reason (n = 63/66, 96.9%) for their unfamiliarity. Patients who presented after an opioid overdose (25.5%;n = 42) were less likely to have knowledge of THN programs (57.1% vs. 76.4%), and to have received a NK (35.7% vs. 61.0%).Conclusion:Awareness of THN programs was high among our cohort. But approximately 60% the respondents received a NK or knew how to use it. Despite efforts to expand THN access, gaps in knowledge, access, and use exist.

J	Cocchini, Gianna; Beschin, Nicoletta								The Fluff test: Improved scoring system to account for different degrees of contralesional and ipsilesional personal neglect in brain damaged patients								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				32	1			69	83		10.1080/09602011.2020.1797828			JAN 2 2022	2022	The Fluff test is a simple test to assess evidence of personal neglect (PN) in brain-damaged patients. While blindfolded, patients are asked to remove targets previously attached to their body and the number of targets detached provides information about possible spatial bias. This test has been widely used for clinical and research purposes. However, the current scoring system presents some limitations, which make difficult to interpret patients' performance in terms of both contralalesional and ipsilesional PN when they omit targets on the ipsilesional side. Moreover, it does not consider possible confounding variables, such as non-spatial cognitive deficits or lack of compliance that may affect patients' performance and lead to incorrect diagnosis. The present paper proposes a new scoring method overcoming the limitations mentioned above and it analyses data from a large sample of 243 brain-damaged patients. Findings showed that contralesional PN was significantly more severe, but not more frequent, following right (31%) than left (21%) brain damage. We also found evidence of left ipsilesional PN and cases of potential mis-diagnosis that would have passed unnoticed with the original scoring system. The new scoring method allows to identify different degrees of contralesional and ipsilesional PN and potential confounding variable.

Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the ventral route of face processing and memory should end at the anterior temporal lobes (i.e., vATLs), which may play an important role bridging face perception and face memory. It is not entirely clear, however, the extent to which neural activities in these face-selective regions can effectively predict behavioral performance on tasks that are frequently used to investigate face processing and face memory test that requires recognition beyond variation in pose and lighting, especially when non-Caucasian East Asian faces are involved. To address these questions, we first identified during a functional scan the core face network by asking participants to perform a one-back task, while viewing either static images or dynamic videos. Dynamic localizers were effective in identifying regions of interest (ROIs) in the core face-processing system. We then correlated the brain activities of core ROIs with performances on face-processing tasks (component, configural, and composite) and face memory test (Taiwanese Face Memory Test, TFMT) and found evidence for limited predictability. We next adopted an multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach to further explore the predictability of face-selective brain regions on TFMT performance and found evidence suggesting that a basic visual processing area such as calcarine and an area for structural face processing such as OFA may play an even greater role in memorizing faces. Implications regarding how differences in processing demands between behavioral and neuroimaging tasks and cultural specificity in face-processing and memory strategies among participants may have contributed to the findings reported here are discussed.

Participants were asked about past-year ecstasy use, and those reporting use were asked where they initiated use and whether their first use was planned. They were also asked whether they have ever given someone their first dose and whether they were likely to use in the future. Prevalence and correlates of these outcomes were estimated among those reporting past-year use.Results:An estimated 31.0% of participants used ecstasy in the past year. Of these, 42.9% used ecstasy for the first time in an unplanned manner and initiation most commonly occurred at EDM festivals (33.4%), followed by nightclubs (24.3%). An estimated 39.4% reported having given someone their first dose of ecstasy and 60.2% reported being likely to use again. Hispanic and Asian participants were at higher risk for their first dose being unplanned, and those who used LSD in the past year were at higher risk for giving someone their first dose (aPR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.20-2.65). Older participants (aPR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.06), females (aPR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.13-1.89), and those who used LSD in the past year (aPR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.14-1.76) were more likely to report being likely to use again in the future.Conclusions:Results provide insight regarding diffusion and initiation of ecstasy in the EDM scene. Findings can inform prevention and harm reduction efforts.

Syringe Service Program Utilization, Barriers, and Preferences for Design in Rural Appalachia: Differences between Men and Women Who Inject Drugs								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	14			2268	2277		10.1080/10826084.2020.1800741			JUL 29 2020	2020	BackgroundPeople who inject drugs (PWID) in rural areas of the United States have had limited access to syringe service programs (SSP). Rural SSP have recently surged, but accompanying research is lacking about PWID utilization, barriers, and preferences for SSP design and how those preferences vary by gender.Methods:Interviewer-administered surveys elicited information about utilization, barriers, and preferences for SSP design from 234 PWID recruited using respondent-driven sampling in Appalachian, Kentucky. Gender differences among reported barriers to utilizing SSP and preferences for program design were explored using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests.Results:Overall, 49% of PWID had ever utilized an SSP. The most common reasons for not utilizing an SSP were lack of awareness (23%), fear of being seen or disclosing drug use (19%), and lack of need (19%). The most preferred SSP design was located within a health department (74%) and operating during afternoon hours (66%). Men were more likely than women to prefer SSP in health departments (80% vs. 65%,p = 0.01), while more women than men preferred staffing by health department personnel (62% vs. 46%,p = 0.02). Women were less likely to favor evening hours (55% vs. 70%,p = 0.02). Fewer women wanted SSP nurses (78% vs. 90%,p = 0.01), social workers (11% vs. 24%,p = 0.01), or people who use drugs (20% vs 34%,p = 0.02) to staff SSP.Conclusions:Despite recent scale-up, SSP in Appalachia remain under-utilized. PWID were open to a range of options for SSP design and staffing, though there were variations by gender. Implementation research that identifies best strategies for tailored SSP scale-up in rural settings should be considered.

However, few available self-report measures reliably and validly assess the full range of addictive conditions. The development and initial validation of a new measure-Recognizing Addictive Disorders (RADs) scale addresses a significant gap in the literature.Method: After items were generated and evaluated in Study 1, Study 2 (N = 300), applied exploratory factor analysis to the item pool using an online-based community sample. In Study 3 (N = 427), the factor structure was validated using an independent online-based community sample and confirmatory factor analysis.Results: The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (a= .92) and construct validity, including replication of the factor structure (chi(2)(553) = 760.83,p< .001, CFI = .997, TLI = .997, RMSEA = .030) and correlation with a related transdiagnostic measure of addiction (r= .72).Discussion: Overall, results support the preliminary validity of a brief transdiagnostic measure of addiction that considers a diverse range of behaviors. For patients presenting to substance abuse treatment, this tool may be useful in identifying symptoms of other types of non-substance problems, which could ultimately aid in treatment planning.

There is limited research on substance use among individuals with SCD.Objective:The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of substance use in patients with SCD and determine whether psychosocial or clinical risk factors are associated with substance use.Methods:This study was conducted as part of an observational study of patients with SCD at two academic medical centers. We asked participants (ages 15 and older) about the lifetime use of heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, and marijuana/cannabis. We measured stigma, depression, urban life stress, pain catastrophizing, and asked about a brief pain inventory.Results:Of 258 participants, 24.9% (n = 71) reported substance use. Marijuana was the most common substance used (22.5%;n = 65). The mean depressive score met criteria for positive screen amongst individuals who reported a history of substance use (mean 10.7(5.76)). Adjusting for age, sex, yearly family income, and education level, odds of substance use increased with higher levels of internalized stigma (aOR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.77;p = 0.012); higher urban life stress scores (aOR 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12;p = 0.017) and higher pain catastrophizing scores (aOR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06;p = 0.008).Conclusions:Among individuals with SCD who endorse substance use, there was markedly more stress and distress with higher rates of depression and poorer quality of life. Interventions focusing on improving distress tolerance and coping to not only pain, but also social stressors, might reduce substance use.		[Wilson, J.

Existing resesarch suggests some overlap between post-traumatic growth and value-directed living. This study sought to explore the relationship between post-traumatic growth and value-directed living after acquired brain injury. Self-report questionnaires including the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Valued Living Questionnaire, Engaged Living Scale, Valuing Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, World Health Organization Well-Being Index, Brief Resilience Scale, Trauma Screening Questionnaire and Glasgow Outcome Scale were posted to 317 individuals who had experienced a head injury, stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage in the previous 3-13 years, with a hospital admission of minimum 7 days. Questionnaires were completed by 81 participants. Post-traumatic growth was significantly positively associated with two measures of value-directed living (VLQ,r = .269; VQ,r = .215). Higher levels of value-directed living were significantly associated with increased positive outcomes (wellbeing) and reduced negative outcomes (distress, post-traumatic stress symptoms). There was no significant association between post-traumatic growth and any of these outcomes. The association between post-traumatic growth and value-directed living indicates possible common underlying processes. Value-directed living appears to be a more useful concept, as it was associated with clinically relevant outcomes. It is recommended that value-directed living interventions are considered in brain injury rehabilitation.

Participants walked at a self-selected pace along a pathway, placing their foot into a raised rectangular floor-based target box followed by either no obstacles, one obstacle, or two obstacles. Stepping kinematics and accuracy were determined using three-dimensional motion capture, whilst gaze was determined using mobile eye-tracking equipment. The children with DCD displayed greater foot placement error and variability when placing their foot within the target box and were more likely to make contact with its edges than their typically developing (TD) peers. The DCD group also displayed greater variability in the length and width of their steps in the approach to the target box. No differences were observed between groups in any of the gaze variables measured, in mediolateral velocity of the center of mass during the swing phase into the target box, or in the levels of self-reported state-anxiety experienced prior to facing each task. We therefore provide the first quantifiable evidence that deficits to foot placement accuracy and precision may be partially responsible for the increased incidence of trips and falls in DCD, and that these deficits are likely to occur independently from gaze behavior and state-anxiety.

Cumulative migration stressors - including historical trauma, violence, family separation, and poverty - present challenges to human service systems wherein services may not adequately meet the needs of these groups.Objectives: This study explores the challenges and realities of substance use, substance use service provision, and delivery of services among the increasingly diverse immigrant population using multiple perspectives. This study is based on data from a larger mixed methods study that assessed the human service landscape pertaining to the immigrant population in a mid-western region of the United States.Methods: This transformative mixed methods study used a community based participatory research approach. Data were collected from human service providers (HSPs), informal service providers, and local community leaders through surveys (n = 64), in-depth interviews (n = 23), and six focus group discussions (n = 48). A weaving approach was used to integrate findings from quantitative and qualitative data.Results: Participants recognize substance use as an issue that needs immediate attention among increasingly diverse immigrant communities. Community members and human service organizations identified several emergent themes including patterns and occurrence of substance use, barriers to care, and proposed system changes.Conclusions: Given that only 28% of responding organizations list substance use as part of their core services, the need for organizational collaborations with a focus on culturally responsive evidence-based services is proposed.

To investigate whether nicotine also enhances reward in humans, we used a virtual translation of the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to examine nicotine's reward-enhancing effects using a low-dose 2 mg nicotine lozenge targeted to a mild use population.Methods:Sixty-eight nicotine-using undergraduates were randomly assigned to receive either a 2 mg nicotine or placebo lozenge prior to conditioning. During each of six, three-minute conditioning sessions, participants were confined to one of two VR rooms. In one room, they received real chocolate M&Ms, whereas no M&Ms were administered in the other room. Following conditioning, a three-minute free-access test session occurred during which participants had unrestricted access to both rooms without reward.Results:Individuals who received nicotine demonstrated a CPP by spending significantly more time in the room previously paired with M&Ms compared to the unrewarded room (p = 0.04). Those who received placebo did not demonstrate a CPP (p > 0.05). Moreover, we observed no significant differences between treatment groups in terms of the amount of time spent in each virtual room.Conclusion:While nicotine seems to facilitate CPP expression for a virtual environment previously paired with chocolate food rewards, further characterization of the mechanism by which this occurs is needed.

Students who identify as sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer/questioning) may be at an increased risk of bullying victimization and substance use due to their sexual identity (Caputi,2018).Purpose/Objectives:This study explored the relationship between bullying in school and cyberbullying (i.e. bullying through social media) victimization with past 30-day e-cigarette use for sexual minority youths, an at-risk group for victimization and its negative consequences.Methods:The Youth Risk Behavioral Survey was utilized to study a sample of sexual minority high school students (N = 2302; 69.4% female). Three models were utilized to examine whether bullying in school or cyberbullying victimization were related to e-cigarette use after controlling only for demographics in the demographics model, and then the use of other substances in the substance use model. Cigarette use was combined with e-cigarettes as the dependent variable in the third comparative model.Results:After controlling for age, race, sex, sexual identity, and other substance use, bullying victimization in school and online were significantly related to current e-cigarette use together but not separately. Cyberbullying victimization was significantly related to combined cigarette and e-cigarette use.Conclusions/Importance:These findings suggest that sexual minority students who report cyberbullying victimization may use cigarette products more than their noncyberbullied peers. Cyberbullying prevention and interventions should continue to be targeted in schools, especially for sexual minority youths.

Even though learning constitutes an elementary aspect of NF, the question whether certain training schemes might positively influence its dynamics has largely been neglected. Methods To address this issue, participants were trained to exert control on their subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal, receiving either exclusively positive reinforcement (PR, "positive feedback") or also positive punishment (PP, "negative feedback"). The temporal dynamics of the learning process were investigated by individually modeling the feedback periods and trends, offering the possibility to assess activation changes within and across blocks, runs and sessions. Results The results show faster initial learning of the PR + PP group by significantly lower deactivations of the sgACC in the first session and stronger regulation trends during the first runs. Independent of the group, significant control over the sgACC could further be shown with but not without feedback. Conclusion The beneficial effect of PP is supported by previous findings of multiple research domains suggesting that error avoidance represents an important motivational factor of learning, which complements the reward spectrum. This hypothesis warrants further investigation with respect to NF, as it could offer a way to generally facilitate the process of gaining volitional control over brain activity.

We defined regions of interest (ROI) based on the results of our previous study, and subsequently used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), especially probabilistic fiber tractography, for the identification of white matter tracts of interest. Accordingly, we extracted the fractional anisotropy (FA) from the tracts of interest and applied data-driven hierarchical clustering to examine whether a specific pattern exists in white matter tracts. We found three clusters in the fronto-basal ganglia circuits: (1) the IFG-SMA and IFG- STN; (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-caudate and caudate-STN and caudate-IFG; and (3) the SMA-STN. Further investigation with pairwise linear inter-tract FA correlations revealed that there were significant correlations between specific pairs: (1) the DLPFC-caudate and caudate-IFG; (2) the caudate-IFG and IFG-SMA; (3) the IFG-SMA and SMA-STN; (4) the IFG-SMA and caudate-SMA; (5) the IFG-SMA and IFG-STN; (6) the SMA-STN and caudate-STN; (7) the SMA-STN and IFG-STN; and (8) the caudate-STN and IFG-STN. The combination of results from hierarchical clustering and microstructural correlations showed that probabilistic tractography infers effective connectivity: i.e., the DLPFC-caudate-IFG-SMA-STN pathway. Our results revealed that specific clusters in the fronto-basal ganglia circuit and certain pairs of white matter tracts with significant correlations predict the effective pathways (hyper-direct and indirect pathways) in response inhibition.

However, studies investigating the rehabilitation outcomes of right-sided USN are lacking. We aimed to investigate (1) the clinical impacts of USN, including right-sided USN, for stroke patients in sub-acute rehabilitation, and (2) evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics and rehabilitation outcomes between right- and left-sided USN patients. We retrospectively screened the medical records of 297 inpatients at the Tokyo-Bay Rehabilitation Hospital who experienced a cerebrovascular accident with supratentorial lesions between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. We performed independent multiple regression analysis in patients with left and right hemisphere damage. The Behavioral Inattention Test was a significant independent variable for predicting the motor, cognitive, and total functional independence measure (FIM), compared to the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set and Mini-Mental State Examination. USN affects motor FIM recovery more than cognitive FIM recovery regardless of the damaged hemisphere. Our study results confirm that both right- and left-sided USN influence the functional recovery of stroke patients. USN occurs, slightly less frequently, following a left hemisphere stroke. However, USN negatively affected rehabilitation outcomes, regardless of the neglected side. Therefore, USN treatment is necessary for patients with left and right hemisphere damage.

This subtle waning, although it cannot be diagnosable as dementia, is noted by caregivers on the basis of their relative's behaviors. Crucially, if this condition is also not detected in time by clinicians, it can easily turn into dementia. Thus, early detection of MCI is strongly needed. Classical neuropsychological measures - underlying a categorical model of diagnosis - could be integrated with a dimensional assessment approach involving Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can be used to create highly ecologically controlled simulations resembling the daily life contexts in which patients' daily instrumental activities (IADL) usually take place. Clinicians can record patients' kinematics, particularly gait, while performing IADL (Digital Biomarkers). Then, Artificial Intelligence employs Machine Learning (ML) to analyze them in combination with clinical and neuropsychological data. This integrated computational approach would enable the creation of a predictive model to identify specific patterns of cognitive and motor impairment in MCI. Therefore, this new dimensional cognitive-behavioral assessment would reveal elderly people's neural alterations and impaired cognitive functions, typical of MCI and dementia, even in early stages for more time-sensitive interventions.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis is marketed as a treatment for many conditions and sales rose to more than 820 million in 2017. Yet CBD is mostly unregulated, legality is murky, and many of the health claims are not scientifically proven.Purpose:This content analysis examined how CBD products were portrayed on Pinterest.Methods: In 2018, using the search terms cannabidiol and CBD, researchers sampled every fifth pin to collect 226 relevant pins. A codebook was developed, pilot tested, and used to code pins.Results: The majority (91.6%) of pins positively portrayed CBD with many claiming a physical or mental benefit including anxiety, depression, pain, and inflammation relief. Most pins did not (98.2%) address potential side effects or recommend dosage. In this sample, user engagement was high with 85.2% of pins being saved and links to commercial sites selling CBD products, personal blogs, and social media accounts.Conclusions: Social media has become a powerful source of health information. This study revealed widespread acceptance of the use of CBD products with minimal information from reliable public health sources represented.

However, few studies have investigated the electrophysiological mechanisms of response activation and response inhibition in these patients. In this study, we employ an event-related potentials (ERPs) technique to quantitatively assess response activation and inhibition before and after the surgical treatment of prolactinomas. A 64-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) skullcap was used to record the brain activity in 20 pre-operative patients, 20 follow-up post-operative patients, and 20 healthy controls (HCs) while performing the visual Go/Nogo task. As expected, we identified P300 across all study populations that could reflect response activation and inhibition. Across the three groups, the Nogo stimuli evoked larger frontal-central P300 than the Go stimuli did. In contrast, the Go trials elicited larger parietal P300 than the Nogo trials did. The peak latency of P300 was significantly delayed in both the pre-operative and the post-operative groups compared to the HCs. The amplitude of P300 in both the Go and the Nogo conditions was significantly decreased in the pre-operative patients compared with that of the HCs. At 6 months post-operatively, the prolactinoma patients showed an increase in amplitude of P300 during both the Go and the Nogo tasks. These findings indicate that the prolactinoma patients suffer from deficits in response activation and inhibition, which could be improved by surgical treatment.

Recent research with Venezuelan parents suggests that many are exposed to elevated migration-related stress, experience behavioral health problems, and express profound concern for their children's post-migration wellbeing. We examine the relationships between stress, family functioning, and substance use risk with a cultural stress theoretical lens.Methods:Survey data were collected between November 2018 and June 2019 from 402 recently-arrived Venezuelan immigrant youth ages 10-17. Outcomes include perceived discrimination, negative context of reception, family support/communication, and substance use intentions and normative beliefs. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships between variables.Results: Structural equation modeling results indicated that negative context of reception was associated with permissive substance use norms (viafamily communication;B = 0.070,p < .01) and intentions to use (viafamily support;B = 0.051,p < .01). Discrimination was not mediated by family functioning, rather it exerted a direct effect on substance use norms (beta = 0.20,p < .01) and intentions (beta = 0.33,p < .001).Discussion: We see clear evidence that negative context of reception and discrimination are related to substance use risk, both directly (in the case of discrimination) and indirectly (in the case of negative context of reception). Given the manifold stressors faced by Venezuelan immigrants both prior to migration and in the process of resettling in the US, it is critical that practitioners and policymakers support this rapidly-growing population.

The brain disturbances that cause this disorder remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate how the morphology of cortical and subcortical brain structures differed in PE, how these morphologic differences were associated with severity measures of PE, such as intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), and how these cortical and subcortical structures were causally connected through mediation analysis. Anatomical MRI scans were acquired from 39 male participants, 23 with PE (28.78 +/- 4.32 years), and 16 without PE (27.88 +/- 3.65 years). We used a subcortical analysis package within FSL to perform subcortical shape segmentation and statistical analysis. The PE group was compared with the normal control (NC) group in the shapes of 15 subcortical structures with general linear models [p< 0.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected]. We analyzed the cortical complexity revealed by the gyrification index using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12). Vertex-wise shape analyses revealed outward shape deformations (expansions) in the left hippocampus and bilateral thalamus. Gyrification index analyses revealed that the right orbital frontal cortex and the right nucleus accumbens had greater complexity in PE patients. The shape deformations were positively correlated with the IELTs in the NC group, while this relationship was interrupted in the PE group. PE is associated with outward deformations of the subcortical surfaces and more complexity of the cortical structures. These morphological differences may be the basis of the brain functional alterations underlying PE.

This apparent incongruity may stem from the difference in the assumed cognitive processes of the situation-response association and the integrative or creative processing of social information. To examine the neural correlates of different SSU types using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we devised a clothing recommendation task in three types of client's standpoint. Situation-response association was induced by a situation-congruent standpoint (ecological SSU), whereas the integrative and creative processing of social information was elicited by a lack and situation incongruence of the standpoint (perceptual and elaborative SSUs, respectively). Activation characteristic of the ecological SSU was identified in the right amygdala, while that of the perceptual SSU and elaborative SSU demand was identified in the right pSTS and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), respectively. Thus, the current results provide evidence for the conceptual and neural distinction of the three types of SSU, with basic ecological SSU being supported by a limbic structure while sophisticated integrative or creative SSUs being developed in humans by multimodal association cortices.

Our first step in a multi-stage research programme aimed to determine which neglect tests are used (within four categories: cognitive, functional, neurological and neuroimaging/neuromodulation), by which stroke clinicians, in which countries, and whether choice is by professional autonomy or institutional policy. 454 clinicians responded to an online survey: 12 professions (e.g., 39% were occupational therapists) from 33 countries (e.g., 38% from the UK). Multifactorial logistic regression suggested inter-professional differences but fewer differences between countries (Italy was an outlier). Cognitive tests were used by 82% (particularly by psychologists, cancellation and drawing were most popular); 80% used functional assessments (physiotherapists were most likely). 20% (mainly physicians, from Italy) used neuroimaging/ neuromodulation. Professionals largely reported clinical autonomy in their choices. Respondents agreed on the need for a combined approach to screening and further training. This study raises awareness of the translation gap between theory and practice. These findings lay an important foundation to subsequent collaborative action between clinicians, researchers and stroke survivors to reach consensus on screening and diagnostic measures. The immediate next step is a review of the measures' psychometric properties.

However, it is not clear how wide the variations in step directions are differentiated and controlled in non-forward step initiation tasks during the APA phase. The main goal of this study is to explain the directional control mechanisms by investigating the APA of step initiation tasks in forward, diagonal, lateral, and posterior directions. The center of pressure (COP) trajectories and related muscle (soleus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius of both lower limbs) activities during the APA of step initiation tasks in nine different directions were analyzed in six healthy young males. Posterior shifts of COP during APA decreased as the direction became more lateral (0 degrees to 90 degrees). For posterior step initiations, COP moved anteriorly from the initial position to accelerate the center of mass of the whole body (COM) backward. Lateral shifts of COP toward the stepping foot during APA decreased as the stepping direction became more lateral (from 0 degrees to 45 degrees and from 180 degrees to 113 degrees) while it plateaued to about zero in the direction from 45 degrees to 113 degrees. Both anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP in APA were nonlinearly modulated to each direction, but they were linearly related to the anteroposterior and mediolateral component of the velocities of COM at the take-off of the stance foot. Thus, the scaling of APA, reflected in the anteroposterior and lateral displacements of COP and the temporal sequence of selected muscle activities, was based on the anteroposterior and mediolateral components of the take-off velocity of COM that ultimately controls the direction of steps.

Here, different imaging measures including both structural [i.e., gray matter volume (GMV)] and functional [i.e., regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC)] measures were employed to detect the gender differences in the human brain based on univariate and multivariate approaches with a sample of 290 healthy adults (155 females). The univariate analyses revealed that gender differences were detected in both structural (i.e., GMV) and functional (ReHo or FC) imaging measures, mainly manifested as greater values in females than in males in regions of the frontal, parietal, occipital lobes and cerebellum. Importantly, there was little overlap between the differences detected in GMV and those detected in ReHo and FC, and their differences between genders were not correlated with each other. The multivariate pattern analyses revealed that each of these measures had discriminative power to successfully distinguish between genders (classification accuracy: 94.3%, 90.73%, and 83.89% for GMV, ReHo, and FC, respectively) and their combination further improved the classification performance (96.6%). Our results suggest that gender differences are encoded in both brain structure and brain function, but in different manners.

Affected individuals also have impaired self-awareness of their own neglect symptoms. The present randomized controlled study was the first proof-of-concept pilot examining the multi-context treatment approach using a protocol of spatial exploration strategy training in one brief session (20-30 minutes). The therapist provided supportive feedback and semi-structured guidance to promote strategy learning and self-discovery of omission errors. 40 patients with left-sided neglect after right brain stroke were included. The results showed that the treatment reduced lateralized bias toward the ipsilesional side of space but did not improve overall detection performance. Impaired general self-awareness of daily-life spatial difficulties was found independent of treatment outcome. This implies that judgment regarding responsiveness to treatment should not be made based on an awareness interview or the severity of neglect symptoms. Lastly, the treatment showed the potential of improving online contextual self-awareness of spatial abilities. A collaborative and interactive approach that focuses on helping the patient self-discover, monitor and self-manage their errors, appears to have a potential for decreasing neglect symptoms. Future studies are required to examine additional aspects of the multi-context treatment approach.

The present study is aimed at evaluating the visuospatial abilities in individuals with WS and comparing their performances with those of mental age-matched typically developing (TD) children by using a highly sensitive ecological version of the Radial Arm Maze (table RAM). We evaluated 15 individuals with WS and 15 TD children in two different table RAM paradigms: the free-choice paradigm, mainly to analyze the aspects linked to procedural and memory components, and the forced-choice paradigm, to disentangle the components linked to spatial working memory from the procedural ones.Data show that individuals with WS made significantly more working memory errors as compared with TD children, thus evidencing a marked deficit in resolving the task when the mnesic load increased. Our findings provide new insights on the cognitive profile of WS.

Bivariate analyses examined demographic and drug characteristics of the 5,988 drug overdose deaths among Hispanics in 2017. Data from 2017 were also utilized to compute age-adjusted drug overdose mortality rates for Hispanics overall, for specific Hispanic heritage groups, and for Non-Hispanic Whites (as a frame of reference). Joinpoint Regression was used to characterize trends in drug overdose mortality among US Hispanic men and women between 2000 and 2017.Results:The majority of Hispanic drug overdose decedents in 2017 were male (76.1%) and US-born (70.0%). Synthetic opioids were involved in the highest proportion of deaths in all Hispanic heritages, except the Mexican heritage group, in which psychostimulants were most commonly involved. The 2017 age-adjusted drug overdose mortality rate for Hispanics overall was lower than the rate among Non-Hispanic Whites, yet the rate among Puerto Rican-heritage Hispanics (29.0, 95% CI 27.6-30.4) was 6% higher than among Non-Hispanic Whites (27.4, 95% CI 27.2-27.6).Conclusions:Results highlight substantial variation in Hispanic drug overdose mortality rates, indicating that national rates for Hispanics obscure higher-risk subgroups. The diverse demographic profiles of Hispanic drug overdose decedents underscore the need for culturally tailored interventions.

Thus, identifying health consequences of co-occurring use of these substances represents an emerging research priority.Purpose/Objectives:This study evaluated the relationship between tobacco/cannabis co-use and acute symptoms of respiratory illness among young adult intermittent smokers. We hypothesized that tobacco/cannabis co-use would be more strongly associated with respiratory symptoms relative to use of neither or one product.Methods:A secondary analysis of a three-year observational study was conducted. Non-daily smokers (n = 563) aged 18-24 were recruited via social media and completed electronic surveys at baseline and annually for two years, producing three total assessments. Past-two-week use of tobacco and cannabis was measured at each assessment, as was severity of six acute respiratory symptoms. The respiratory measure was dichotomized to indicate the presence or absence of symptoms.Results:Tobacco/cannabis co-use decreased from 54.8% at baseline to 43.4% at year two (p< .001). Mean respiratory symptoms also declined significantly over time (ps < .05). At each timepoint, co-use was more strongly associated with presence of respiratory symptoms than the use of neither product (aORs = 2.73-4.39,ps <= .013). Co-users were also 38%-183% more likely to endorse the presence of respiratory symptoms than single product users at each timepoint (aORs = 1.38-2.83,ps = .023-.212).Conclusions/Importance:Although co-occurring use of tobacco and cannabis by young adults may represent experimental use of multiple substances, it may also promote or exacerbate acute symptoms of respiratory illness. Further exploration with more granular patterns of co-use and across different routes of administration is warranted.

This laboratory-based pilot study examined the SmartPrompt feasibility, efficacy, and subjective usability using a within-participant, counterbalanced, cross-over design. Ten participants (Mage = 80.3 + 8.2;Meducation = 15.7 + 2.5; 60% female) with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia completed the Remember to Drink Test, which required preparing a glass of water at four predetermined times, in a SmartPrompt (SP) and Unprompted condition (UP). Written cues and a clock were available in both conditions; however, in the SP, the smartphone presented auditory alarms and visual reminders to obtain the water at specified times and required photo logging. In a separate session, caregivers were trained and tested on configuring the SmartPrompt. Overall, caregivers and participants learned to effectively use the SmartPrompt. Caregivers achieved near-perfect scores on the configuration quiz and responded well to training. Participants completed significantly more Remember to Drink tasks in the SP (93%) than UP (56%); checking the cues/clock decreased by 87% in the SP. Usability ratings were excellent among caregivers and fair among participants. Results indicate that the SmartPrompt holds promise for reducing functional disability in older adults with cognitive difficulties in at-home contexts.

We aimed to explore the issue of acceptability by characterizing the experience of telerehabilitation for service providers and consumers of a memory rehabilitation program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine clinicians (M-age = 33.29;SD = 7.37; range 25-44) and 25 stroke survivors with memory difficulties (M-age = 54.12;SD = 10.99; range 36-82) following a 6-week compensatory memory skills program delivered via in-home videoconferencing. Thematic analysis identified a range of perspectives under three overarching themes: (1)Content and Delivery; (2)Relationship and Connection; and (3)The Role and Benefits of Telerehabilitation. Reports from both respondent groups were overwhelmingly positive about the telerehabilitation experience and identified the benefits of increasing service availability. Videoconferencing technology was usable and occasional reliability issues were not a barrier. Users identified a range of benefits and challenges regarding communication, rapport building, and integration of rehabilitation in the home environment. Furthermore, most stroke survivors reported benefit from the intervention, via the acquisition of memory strategies and improved self-confidence through better understanding of their deficits. Overall, telerehabilitation of memory was acceptable to users.

Interventions which incorporate metacognitive strategy instruction have the potential to improve rehabilitation engagement and outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether an occupation-based intervention incorporating metacognitive strategy instruction resulted in goal achievement and improved online awareness and executive function performance during goal-related tasks. A single-case experimental design using a multiple-baseline design across behaviours was used with two participants with severe traumatic brain injury to evaluate the effectiveness of the 6-week intervention. Repeated measures of goal-related performance, percentage of self-corrected errors and executive function were made via independent analysis of video footage and documentation logs. Data analysis involved 2SD bandwidth analysis and overlap data, reliable change index and evaluation of goal achievement across phases. There were improvements in self-corrected errors for one participant, which were maintained. Significant reductions in anxiety (RCI = +/- 5.98) were evident for both participants, with a significant reduction in stress (RCI = +/- 7.05) for one participant following the intervention. The occupation-based intervention incorporating metacognitive strategy instruction led to improvements compared to baseline performance in some targeted goals, online awareness and executive function performance during goal-related tasks and reduced stress and anxiety.

Here, we asked whether variation in lesion topography affects these two movements similarly or distinctly and whether lesion impact is similar or distinct for left and right hemisphere damage. Shoulder abduction and finger extension movements were examined in 77 chronic post-stroke patients using relevant items of the Fugl-Meyer test. Lesion effects were analyzed separately for left and right hemispheric damage patient groups, using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. In the left hemispheric damage group, shoulder abduction and finger extension were affected only by damage to the corticospinal tract in its passage through the corona radiata. In contrast, following the right hemispheric damage, these two movements were affected not only by corticospinal tract damage but also by damage to white matter association tracts, the putamen, and the insular cortex. In both groups, voxel clusters have been found where damage affected shoulder abduction and also finger extension, along with voxels where damage affected only one of the two movements. The capacity to execute shoulder abduction and finger extension movements following stroke is affected significantly by damage to shared and distinct voxels in the corticospinal tract in left-hemispheric damage patients and by damage to shared and distinct voxels in a larger array of cortical and subcortical regions in right hemispheric damage patients.

We report on a 50-year-old woman with a diagnosis of psychogenic myoclonus in the right lower limb, who was treated with a daily session (in the late morning/early afternoon) of 1 Hz rTMS over the left premotor cortex (PMC), five times a week for 6 weeks. Clinical data and EEG at rest were collected before and immediately and 2-month after the rTMS protocol completion. The patient reported a significant reduction of involuntary movement frequency and intensity and the related disability burden up to the follow-up. In parallel, any abnormality in terms of source current density within and connectivity between the frontal and parietal areas was reset. The short follow-up period, the lack of extensive neurophysiological measures, and the lack of control treatment represent the main limitation of the study. However, low-frequency rTMS over PMC seems a safe and promising approach for the management of psychogenic myoclonus owing to the combination of cortical neuromodulation and non-specific mechanisms suggesting cognitive-behavioral effects.

The cognitive style ranges between two extremes: analytic and holistic processing style. The concept of cognitive style has been widely investigated in the literature, but its age-related differences in the neural substrates have remained elusive. In this study, we focused on the white matter structure of the corpus callosum and its possible link to age-related differences in cognitive style, given its functional ability to connect and facilitate efficient communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Seventy-two participants aged 20-75 years participated in this study. Participants' cognitive styles were measured by the Analysis-Holism Scale (AHS), and their white matter microstructures were acquired using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The results revealed that older adults tend to have a more holistic processing style than younger adults. We then compared the white matter of tracts of interest between high and low AHS groups and found that the white matter microstructure in the genu of the corpus callosum can be used to distinguish between AHS subgroups. Interestingly, we found that age negatively correlated with the white matter tracts across the brain, indicating that aging is associated with reduced microstructure integrity. Together, our findings suggest that analytic-holistic cognitive styles of information processing possibly reflect that the microstructure development in the anterior part of the corpus callosum may influence the type of age-related information processing.

The Electrocortical Signature of Successful and Unsuccessful Deception in a Face-to-Face Social Interaction								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						277	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00277			JUL 17 2020	2020	Deceptive behavior, and the evaluation of others' behavior as truthful or deceptive, are crucial aspects of human social interaction. We report a study investigating two participants in a social interaction, performing a deception task. The first participant, the "informant," made true or false autobiographical statements. The second participant, the "detective," then classified these statements as truth or lie. Behavioral data showed that detectives performed slightly above chance and were better at correctly identifying true as compared with deceptive statements. This presumably reflects the "truth bias": the finding that individuals are more likely to classify others' statements as truthful than as deceptive - even when informed that a lie is as likely to be told as the truth. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from the informant. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a smaller contingent negative variation (CNV) preceding "convincing" statements (statements classified as true by the detective) compared to "unconvincing" statements (statements classified as lie by the detective) - irrespective of whether the statements were actually truthful or deceptive. This finding suggests a distinct electrocortical signature of "successful" compared to "unsuccessful" deceptive statements. One possible explanation is that the pronounced CNV indicates the individuals' higher "cognitive load" when processing unconvincing statements.

Feature vectors have been constructed using the temporal characteristics of concentration changes in fNIRS chromophores such as mean, slope, and variance to implement fNIRS-BCIs systems. The mean and slope, which are the most popular features in fNIRS-BCIs, were adopted. Linear support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis were employed, respectively, as a single strong learner and multiple weak learners. All features in every channel and available time window were employed to train the strong learner, and the feature subsets were selected at random to train multiple weak learners. It was determined that random subspace ensemble learning is beneficial to enhance the performance of fNIRS-BCIs.

However, less is known about how anxiety shapes neural face processing in mothers of older children. In our study, 36 mothers of 8-10 year old children completed a Go/NoGo task consisting of neutral and emotional (happy, fearful) facial expressions posed by unfamiliar school-aged children while EEG was recorded. Higher levels of maternal anxiety -indexed via self-report- were associated with delayed behavioral responses to children's fearful faces and increased N170 and LPP amplitudes elicited by children's neutral faces. While anxiety was also positively related to the LPP elicited by children's emotional faces, it only led to increased N170 amplitude responses to children's fearful, but not happy, faces and only when they were NoGo cues. The study replicates and extends prior findings examining the impact of maternal anxiety on neural responses to neutral infant faces to later stages of parenting with further neural markers and emotional expressions being affected. Findings evidence the importance of studying these associations beyond infancy to increase our knowledge about processes potentially underlying the relation between anxiety and less optimal parenting across development.

J	McCaskey, Ursina; von Aster, Michael; O'Gorman, Ruth; Kucian, Karin								Persistent Differences in Brain Structure in Developmental Dyscalculia: A Longitudinal Morphometry Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						272	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00272			JUL 17 2020	2020	Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of numerical-arithmetical skills. Affected people show persistent deficits in number processing, which are associated with aberrant brain activation and structure. Reduced gray matter has been reported in DD for the parietal cortex including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but also the frontal and occipito-temporal cortex. Furthermore, dyscalculics show white matter differences for instance in the inferior (ILF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). However, the longitudinal development of these structural differences is unknown. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the developmental trajectory of gray and white matter in children with and without DD. In this longitudinal study, neuropsychological measures and T1-weighted structural images were collected twice with an interval of 4 years from 13 children with DD (8.2-10.4 years) and 10 typically developing (TD) children (8.0-10.4 years). Voxel-wise estimation of gray and white matter volumes was assessed using voxel-based morphometry for longitudinal data. The present findings reveal for the first time that DD children show persistently reduced gray and white matter volumes over development. Reduced gray matter was found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobes including the IPS, supramarginal gyri, left precuneus, cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri, and insula. White matter volumes were reduced in the bilateral ILF and SLF, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), corticospinal tracts, and right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). Behaviorally, children with DD performed significantly worse in various numerical tasks at baseline and follow-up, corroborating persistent deficits in number processing. The present results are in line with the literature showing that children with DD have reduced gray and white matter volumes in the numerical network. Our study further sheds light on the trajectory of brain development, revealing that these known structural differences in the long association fibers and the adjacent regions of the temporal- and frontoparietal cortex persist in dyscalculic children from childhood into adolescence. In conclusion, our results underscore that DD is a persistent learning disorder accompanied by deficits in number processing and reduced gray and white matter volumes in number related brain areas.

Subjective Evaluation of Performance in a Collaborative Task Is Better Predicted From Autonomic Response Than From True Achievements								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						234	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00234			JUL 17 2020	2020	Whereas the fundamental role of the body in social cognition seems to be generally accepted, elucidating the bodily mechanisms associated with non-verbal communication and cooperation between two or more persons is still a challenging endeavor. In this article we propose a fresh approach for investigating the function of the autonomic nervous system that is reflected in parameters of heart rate variability, respiration, and electrodermal activity in a social setting. We analyzed autonomic parameters of dyads solving a target-tracking task together with the partner or individually. A machine classifier was trained to predict the subjects' rating of performance and collaboration either from tracking error data or from the set of autonomic parameters. When subjects collaborated, this classifier could predict the subjective performance ratings better from the autonomic response than from the objective performance of the subjects. However, when they solved the task individually, predictability from autonomic parameters dropped to the level of objective performance, indicating that subjects were more rational in rating their performance in this condition. Moreover, the model captured general knowledge about the population that allows it to predict the performance ratings of an unseen subject significantly better than chance. Our results suggest that, in particular in situations that require collaboration with others, evaluation of performance is shaped by the bodily processes that are quantified by autonomic parameters. Therefore, subjective performance assessments appear to be modulated not only by the output of a rational or discriminative system that tracks the objective performance but to a significant extent also by interoceptive processes.

Losses Motivate Cognitive Effort More Than Gains in Effort-Based Decision Making and Performance								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						287	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00287			JUL 17 2020	2020	Human behavior is more strongly driven by the motivation to avoid losses than to pursue gains (loss aversion). However, there is little research on how losses influence the motivation to exert effort. We compared the effects of loss and gain incentives on cognitive task performance and effort-based decision making. In three experiments, participants performed a cognitively effortful task under gain and loss conditions and made choices about effort expenditure in a decision-making task. Results consistently showed significant loss aversion in effort-based decision making. Participants were willing to invest more effort in the loss compared to the gain condition (i.e., perform a longer duration task: Experiments 1 and 2; or higher task load: Experiment 3). On the other hand, losses did not lead to improved performance (sustained attention), or higher physiological effort (pupil diameter) in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, losses did enhance working memory performance, but only at the highest load level. Taken together, these results suggest that loss aversion motivates higher effort investment in effort-based decision-making, while the effect of loss aversion during a performance may depend on the task type or effort level.

J	Wang, Diana; Belden, Alexander; Hanser, Suzanne B.; Geddes, Maiya R.; Loui, Psyche								Resting-State Connectivity of Auditory and Reward Systems in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						280	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00280			JUL 17 2020	2020	Music-based interventions (MBI) have become increasingly widely adopted for dementia and related disorders. Previous research shows that music engages reward-related regions through functional connectivity with the auditory system, but evidence for the effectiveness of MBI is mixed in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This underscores the need for a unified mechanistic understanding to motivate MBIs. The main objective of the present study is to characterize the intrinsic connectivity of the auditory and reward systems in healthy aging individuals with MCI, and those with AD. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Database Neuroimaging Initiative, we tested resting-state functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward systems in older adults with MCI, AD, and age-matched healthy controls (N= 105). Seed-based correlations were assessed from regions of interest (ROIs) in the auditory network (i.e., anterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, Heschl's Gyrus), and the reward network (i.e., nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and orbitofrontal cortex). AD individuals were lower in both within-network and between-network functional connectivity in the auditory network and reward networks compared to MCI and controls. Furthermore, graph theory analyses showed that the MCI group had higher clustering and local efficiency than both AD and control groups, whereas AD individuals had lower betweenness centrality than MCI and control groups. Together, the auditory and reward systems show preserved within- and between-network connectivity in MCI individuals relative to AD. These results motivate future music-based interventions in individuals with MCI due to the preservation of functional connectivity within and between auditory and reward networks at that initial stage of neurodegeneration.

Multinomial logistic regression predicted latent profile membership.Findings: Six unique profiles of polysubstance use involving opioids and other substances were found; Primarily Alcohol (9.4%), Primarily Heroin (19.0%), Less Polysubstance Use (34.3%), Tranquilizer Polysubstance Use (16.3%), Primarily Buprenorphine (7.8%), and Stimulant-Opioid (13.2%). Profiles differed by rural/urban geography, injection drug use, physical, and mental health symptoms.Conclusion: Findings indicate the heterogeneity of opioid use among a justice-involved population. More diverse polysubstance patterns may serve as a proxy to identifying individuals with competing physical and mental health needs. Future interventions could be tailored to polysubstance patterns during the period of justice-involvement.

Although neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and brain stimulation studies suggest the dissociation of these operations into distinct parietal cortex areas, the role of strategy (online calculation vs. retrieval) is not yet fully established. In the present study, we further explored the causal involvement of the left AG for multiplication and left hIPS for subtraction using a neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm. Stimulation sites were determined based on an fMRI experiment using the same tasks. To account for the effect of strategy, participants were asked whether they used retrieval or calculation for each individual problem. We predicted that the stimulation of the left AG would selectively disrupt the retrieval of the solution to multiplication problems. On the other hand, stimulation of the left hIPS should selectively disrupt subtraction. Our results revealed that left AG stimulation was detrimental to the retrieval and online calculation of solutions for multiplication problems, as well as, the retrieval (but not online calculation) of the solutions to subtraction problems. In contrast, left hIPS stimulation had no detrimental effect on both operations regardless of strategy.

This study therefore aimed to qualitatively explore the broad long-term experience of living for 10 years or more with TBI. Thirty participants completed semi-structured interviews investigating the impact of TBI on various life domains, the rehabilitation experience and support received, and overall perspectives of the long-term journey after TBI. Results demonstrated that: (a) although some participants reported full recovery, several experienced persistent physical, cognitive and emotional problems that impacted their independence, employment and interpersonal relationships; (b) early rehabilitation was very helpful, but some participants experienced difficulties accessing ongoing services; (c) family and social support were important to recovery; (d) most participants drew upon inner strength to find positives in their experience. These findings have identified factors that facilitate and impede long-term recovery from TBI, which may inform better support and care for injured individuals over the years after injury to improve their quality of life.

Occupational Physical Stress Is Negatively Associated With Hippocampal Volume and Memory in Older Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						266	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00266			JUL 15 2020	2020	Our jobs can provide intellectually and socially enriched environments but also be the source of major psychological and physical stressors. As the average full-time worker spends >8 h at work per weekday and remains in the workforce for about 40 years, occupational experiences must be important factors in cognitive and brain aging. Therefore, we studied whether occupational complexity and stress are associated with hippocampal volume and cognitive ability in 99 cognitively normal older adults. We estimated occupational complexity, physical stress, and psychological stress using the Work Design Questionnaire (Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006), Quantitative Workload Inventory and Interpersonal Conflict at Work Scale (Spector and Jex, 1998). We found that physical stress, comprising physical demands and work conditions, was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and poorer memory performance. These associations were independent of age, gender, brain size, socioeconomic factors (education, income, and job title), duration of the job, employment status, leisure physical activity and general stress. This suggests that physical demands at work and leisure physical activity may have largely independent and opposite effects on brain and cognitive health. Our findings highlight the importance of considering midlife occupational experiences, such as work physical stress, in understanding individual trajectories of cognitive and brain aging.

It might be associated with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms have not been completely clarified. This study explored spontaneous brain activity in ESRD patients on hemodialysis by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Nineteen ESRD patients on regular hemodialysis were included in this study. Eighteen age-, sex- and education level-matched volunteers were enrolled as the healthy control group. All participants had resting-state functional MRI scanning, neuropsychological tests, and laboratory testing. ALFF was used for assessing intrinsic brain activity. Independent samplest-test was used for obtaining group differences. Spearman correlation analysis was applied to assess the association between ALFF changes, neuropsychological, and clinical indices. Compared to the healthy control group, hemodialysis patients showed decreased ALFF in the precuneus, right angular gyrus/inferior lobule as well as increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus and right precentral/postcentral gyrus. The ALFF abnormalities in these regions were closely associated with hemoglobin levels. Also, increased ALFF in the left parahippocampus/hippocampus showed a negative correlation with the score of long-delayed free recall. Hemodialysis patients had aberrant ALFF in the default mode network (DMN) regions, particularly in the precuneus and parahippocampus/hippocampus, which may be correlated with neuropathological mechanisms involved in hemodialysis.

Research has indicated that there are interindividual differences in the processing of emotions. This includes age, which underlies neurological changes that contribute to the specific processing of emotions. Increasing age seems to be associated with a more positive evaluation of emotional information, from perception itself to attention, memory, and decision-making. Method The current study aimed to investigate whether these differences can be found in highly artificial emotional faces. Since emojis are representatives of emotional faces in digital communication, we selected a subset of 13 emojis and asked 170 participants to evaluate them for their ability to represent different target emotions. Results An exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factorial structure with positive and negative valence for most of the ratings for the evaluated emojis. Furthermore, a multilevel model analysis based on the individual factor scores indicated higher age to be associated with an increase in factor scores for negative valence compared to positive valence. Conclusion In the present study, a trend for an age-specific positivity bias could only be shown in the classical smiley, while other emojis were related to negative valence with increasing age. Thus, we revealed age-related differences in emotion classification, even for highly artificial stimuli such as emojis.

However, the effects of breaking up prolonged sedentary periods with frequent, short physical activity bouts on mechanisms to improve brain health remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the immediate effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in the prefrontal cortex in middle-aged adults. Methods: This is a protocol article to describe a randomized crossover study. We will collect data from 13 healthy adults, aged between 40 and 60 years old, with a body mass index <35 kg/m(2). Participants will be required to come into the laboratory on three occasions, sit for 3 h, and perform a different type of break for 3 min every 30 min at each visit in a random order, being either: (1) a social break; (2) brisk walk on a treadmill; or (3) simple resistance activities. Before and after each experimental condition, cerebral blood flow (primary outcome) will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with short-separation channels, and working memory (1-, 2-, and 3-back on the computer) will be assessed. The following additional secondary outcomes will be collected: psychological factors (questionnaires); arterial stiffness; salivary cortisol levels; and blood glucose levels. Conclusion: The results from this randomized crossover study will determine the effects of uninterrupted sitting and frequent, short bouts of physical activity on cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance. Publication of this study protocol emphasizes the importance of registration and publication of protocols in the field of sedentary behavior research.

We investigated 64 four-year-olds: 37 VPT children [<32 weeks gestational age [GA]; 22 males; mean GA: 28.8 weeks +/- 1.6], 25 full-term (FT) children (12 males), plus two VPT cases with ventriculomegaly and exceptionally resilient outcomes. All children underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and developmental assessments. Measures of brain volume, cortical thickness, and surface area were obtained. Children born VPT demonstrated reduced cerebral and cerebellar white matter volumes yet increased cerebral gray matter, temporal lobe, occipital lobe and ventricle volumes after adjusting for total brain volume. Cortical thickness was greater in the VPT children compared to FT children across all lobes. On developmental assessments, the VPT children scored lower on average than FT children while the two cases had intact cognitive abilities. In addition to larger ventricle volumes, the two cases had white matter and gray matter volumes within the ranges of the FT children. The VPT children displayed distinct differences in structural brain volumes at 4 years of age, consistent with delayed maturation. The cases with persistent ventriculomegaly and good cognitive outcomes displayed typical gray matter and increased white matter volumes, indicating a potential protective developmental phenomenon contributing to their intact cognitive abilities.

Graded fMRI Neurofeedback Training of Motor Imagery in Middle Cerebral Artery Stroke Patients: A Preregistered Proof-of-Concept Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						226	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00226			JUL 14 2020	2020	Ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a major brain vessel that supplies the primary motor and premotor cortex, is one of the most common causes for severe upper limb impairment. Currently available motor rehabilitation training largely lacks satisfying efficacy with over 70% of stroke survivors showing residual upper limb dysfunction. Motor imagery-based functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) has been suggested as a potential therapeutic technique to improve motor impairment in stroke survivors. In this preregistered proof-of-concept study (https://osf.io/y69jc/), we translated graded fMRI-NF training, a new paradigm that we have previously studied in healthy participants, to first-time MCA stroke survivors with residual mild to severe impairment of upper limb motor function. Neurofeedback was provided from the supplementary motor area (SMA) targeting two different neurofeedback target levels (low and high). We hypothesized that MCA stroke survivors will show (1) sustained SMA-region of interest (ROI) activation and (2) a difference in SMA-ROI activation between low and high neurofeedback conditions during graded fMRI-NF training. At the group level, we found only anecdotal evidence for these preregistered hypotheses. At the individual level, we found anecdotal to moderate evidence for the absence of the hypothesized graded effect for most subjects. These null findings are relevant for future attempts to employ fMRI-NF training in stroke survivors. The study introduces a Bayesian sequential sampling plan, which incorporates prior knowledge, yielding higher sensitivity. The sampling plan was preregistered together witha priorihypotheses and all planned analysis before data collection to address potential publication/researcher biases. Unforeseen difficulties in the translation of our paradigm to a clinical setting required some deviations from the preregistered protocol. We explicitly detail these changes, discuss the accompanied additional challenges that can arise in clinical neurofeedback studies, and formulate recommendations for how these can be addressed. Taken together, this work provides new insights about the feasibility of motor imagery-based graded fMRI-NF training in MCA stroke survivors and serves as a first example for comprehensive study preregistration of an (fMRI) neurofeedback experiment.

However, it remains unclear whether the deficit is at the perceptual or higher cognitive level of facial emotion processing. Recent studies have shown that earlier face-evoked event-related potential (ERP) components such as N170 and P100 can effectively distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls; however, findings for later waveforms are ambiguous. To clarify this point, in this study we compared electroencephalographic signals in schizophrenia patients and control subjects during a facial expression judgment task. We found that group effects of the occipital N170 and frontal lobe contingent negative variation (CNV) were both significant. The effect sizes (ESs) of N170 and CNV amplitudes were generally medium or small, whereas that of CNV slope for an upright face was large (>0.8). Moreover, N170 amplitude and CNV slope but not CNV amplitude was correlated with Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale score. These results suggest that the slope of CNV drift during facial expression processing has a potential clinical value for schizophrenia.

The workplace is a setting where people may experience discriminatory treatment.Objectives:This study examined associations, between negative emotions due to treatment based on race (NE), workplace racial discrimination (WRD), and substance use outcomes (drinking and smoking), stratified by race.Methods:Data from the cross-sectional 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Minnesota and New Mexico sub-samples, were analyzed. This study excluded non-Hispanic white participants, resulting in a sample ofn = 3098 adult, U.S. residents. Multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to examine the associations, and possible interactions, between WRD, NE, and substance use (alcohol and tobacco).Results:Prior to stratification, WRD was not associated with drinking or smoking after controlling for NE and other sociodemographic variables, however, NE was associated with heavy drinking. NE appeared to account for some of the observed bivariate associations between WRD and heavy drinking and daily smoking. Post-stratification, WRD was associated with heavy drinking for non-Hispanic other respondents, even after controlling for NE. For non-Hispanic black participants, NE was associated with smoking after controlling for WRD. A stratified interaction analysis of WRD*NE revealed that there was only an association between NE and heavy drinking for Hispanic participants who did not experience WRD.Conclusions:The relationship between WRD and substance use may be in part accounted for by NE. Further exploration is needed to more fully understand why associations exist for some race/ethnicity groups but not others.

Ukraine responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with a comprehensive lockdown in late March 2020.Objectives:We conducted a phone survey among 123 OPWH with substance use disorders (SUD) in Kyiv in May 2020 to learn if these older adults may continue HIV and SUD therapy while coping with the Covid-19 pandemic.Results:Data from the survey demonstrated that while OPWH with SUD maintained HIV and SUD therapy throughout Covid-19 lockdown, social support is critical to avoiding treatment interruption for OPWH with SUD.Conclusions/Importance:During reopening, reduction of support may lead to OPWH feeling even more isolated. Post-Covid-19 pharmacological approaches to SUD treatment without social support are like vehicles without gas. The research agenda for OPWH patients with SUD going forward must include determining the type of telehealth support that will be optimally effective to retain OPWH including people who inject drugs (PWID), provision of support by lay health workers, and cost-effectiveness of such interventions. The lessons learned may be relevant to other countries as well.

In this manuscript, we focus on an under studied topic: how active duty police officers understand their role with respect to SCS, and their recommendations for improving relationships with these programs.Methods:During 2018, we audio-recorded and transcribed focus group discussions conducted in four police divisions with 26 police constables and 3 officers of other ranks in Toronto, Canada. Officers were asked about their roles relative to SCS, perceived training needs, and how to build cooperative relationships with SCS. We followed an iterative thematic approach to analyze the data.Results:Participants in three divisions were unclear about their roles, duties, and policy governing policing of SCS. Participants in the fourth division had received instructions from the division commander to observe a "distance and discretion policy". However, these participants believed that developing familiarity with the new SCS, instead of keeping a distance, would be a more effective approach to building working relationships with staff, clients, and the local community. There was nearly unanimous skepticism about the willingness of SCS workers to work cooperatively with the police. These perceptions were commonly linked to previous negative experiences with harm reduction workers and, in some cases, staff at the new SCS. Several participants also linked problems in communication to fundamental differences between the philosophies or worldviews of SCS staff versus those of police.Conclusions:Building collaborative SIS-police relationships can be assisted by demystifying the operation of SCS for police, articulating policies, and working toward mutual respect.

Residential Socioeconomic Environments and Areca Nut Use in Taiwan: A Comparison with Alcohol and Tobacco Use in Multilevel Analysis								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	12			2025	2034		10.1080/10826084.2020.1788089			SEP 1 2020	2020	Background While the association between residential socioeconomic environments and the use of globally common substances such as alcohol and tobacco has been well documented in Western countries, it remains little known about regionally important substances, such as areca nut in Asia.Objective: This study was aimed to develop residential environmental indicators in the context of Taiwan and examine their associations with areca nut use, in comparison to alcohol and tobacco use.Methods:Data were drawn from 13,392 adults across 168 townships in the 2014 National Survey on Substance Use in Taiwan. Residential socioeconomic environment variables were derived from the census and analyzed using factor analysis. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the association of individual- and residential-level factors with the use of areca nut (use/nonuse), alcohol (harmful use, low-risk use, or nonuse), and tobacco (nicotine dependence, regular active use, or nonuse).Results:A three-factor structure of socioeconomic environments derived from 16 residential-level variables consisted of Rural Disadvantage, Affluence, and Family Fragmentation. Multilevel analyses showed that areca nut use was associated with both individual-level (male sex, age group 35-44 years, being divorced/widowed/separated, low educational attainment, and the occupational group of labors) and residential-level (Rural Disadvantaged and Family Fragmented) variables; such a profile was most similar to that of nicotine dependence.Conclusions:A three-factor structure could be derived for the residential-level socioeconomic environments in the Taiwanese context. Rural Disadvantaged and Family Fragmented were associated with areca nut use, which have implications for interventions targeted at the community level.

This group is at increased risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI). They also face stigma and other barriers to accessing reproductive health care.Purpose:To evaluate contraceptive usage, pregnancy intention, and uptake of general and reproductive health services among WWID and exchange sex.Methods:This analysis of the 2016 Seattle area National HIV Behavioral Surveillance survey included women aged 18-49 years who exchanged sex for money or drugs and injected drugs in the last year. We evaluated contraceptive utilization, pregnancy intention, and reproductive health care access.Results:Among 144 respondents meeting inclusion criteria, the median age was 39 (IQR 33-45), the median age at first injection was 22 (IQR 17-28), and the most commonly injected drug was heroin (62.0%). A minority (10.3%) desired pregnancy in the next year. Among women wanting to avoid pregnancy, 65.5% had not used any prescription contraception (pill/patch/ring, injection, intrauterine device, or implant) in the last year. In the last year, nearly all (92.4%) respondents had received health care and over half (59.0%) had had an STI test. Of women eligible for the HPV vaccine, 28.6% had received at least one dose.Conclusions:Most WWID and exchange sex want to avoid pregnancy. Despite accessing health care, a minority are using prescribed contraception. Health care tailored to these women's preferences may reduce unmet contraceptive need and improve access to well-woman care and preconception counseling.

Bivariate associations were examined between MST, SOBD, anxiety and depression, distress in response to stressful military events, and alcohol use. A latent psychological distress factor was estimated using anxiety and depression, and distress in response to stressful military events. Path analyses were used to estimate the direct effects of MST and SOBD on alcohol use and the indirect effects of MST and SOBD on alcohol use through psychological distress.Results:All bivariate associations were positive and significant between MST, SOBD, anxiety and depression, distress in response to military events, and alcohol use. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for demographic covariates, a significant indirect effect was observed for SOBD on alcohol use through psychological distress. MST was not directly or indirectly associated with alcohol use when SOBD was included in the path model.Conclusion:Overall, findings suggest SOBD is associated with poorer mental health, which in turn places LGB military personnel at greater risk of alcohol use and associated problems. These results affirm the need for interventions that reduce SOBD in the military and suggest that these interventions will have a positive impact on the health of LGB military personnel.

Resilience may protect individuals from engaging in these maladaptive behaviors following ACEs.Objectives:We examined the associations between ACEs and excessive alcohol consumption, and ACEs and tobacco intake and exposure among diverse college students, and whether resilience buffered this relationship.Methods:We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in October 2018 with students at a large Southern university to assess ACEs, levels of resilience, and students' health behaviors. We used theAdverse Childhood Experiences - International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ)and theBrief Resilience Scale. Logistic regression modeled the relationship between ACEs and students' substance use behaviors. We adjusted for demographics, other health behaviors, and emotional health and we tested resilience as a possible buffer.Results:Participants (n = 568) were in their early twenties, almost three-fourths were female. We had a racially/ethnically diverse sample. Over two-thirds had experienced 1-4 ACEs. ACE exposure was not associated with excess alcohol consumption but exhibited a consistent dose-response relationship in unadjusted and adjusted models. Moderate ACEs increased the odds of tobacco exposure by 227% (OR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.17-9.11) in adjusted models. Resilience was unrelated to either behavior. Black respondents had significantly reduced odds for both substance use outcomes. Tobacco exposure and excess alcohol intake were comorbid behaviors.Conclusion:Childhood adversity was a significant predictor for tobacco exposure among diverse US college students. Resilience did not buffer this relationship. Age, gender, and race/ethnicity were differentially associated with substance use.

Non-visual BCI paradigms, however, may be required for patients who struggle with vision dependent BCIs because of a loss of gaze control. With the present study, we attempted to replicate earlier results by Herweg et al. (2016), with several minor adjustments and a focus on training effects and usability. We invited 16 healthy participants and trained them with a 4-class tactile P300-based BCI in five sessions. Their main task was to navigate a virtual wheelchair through a 3D apartment using the BCI. We found significant training effects on information transfer rate (ITR), which increased from a mean of 3.10-9.50 bits/min. Further, both online and offline accuracies significantly increased with training from 65% to 86% and 70% to 95%, respectively. We found only a descriptive increase of P300 amplitudes at Fz and Cz with training. Furthermore, we report subjective data from questionnaires, which indicated a relatively high workload and moderate to high satisfaction. Although our participants have not achieved the same high performance as in the Herweg et al. (2016) study, we provide evidence for training effects on performance with a tactile BCI and confirm the feasibility of the paradigm.

Methods: We studied 21 clinically-diagnosed BECTS patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using high-sampling magnetoencephalography (MEG). Neuromagnetic sources were assessed with accumulated source imaging (ASI). The MEG data were analyzed in seven frequency bands. The MEG recordings distinguished BECTS without IEDs (n= 10) from those with IEDs (n= 11) and HC (n= 11). Results: At 1-4 Hz, the neuromagnetic activities in healthy subjects tended to locate at the precuneus/posterior cingulate, while those of the BECTS patients without IEDs tended to locate at the medial frontal cortex (MFC) compared to BECTS patients with IEDs. The MEG source imaging at 30-80 Hz revealed that BECTS patients without IEDs had higher occurrences of interictal brain activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) compared to controls and the brain activity strength seemed to be weaker. There was a significant correlation between the source strength of the interictal gamma oscillations of BECTS patients without IEDs and the duration of epilepsy. Conclusions: IEDs might disrupt the default mode network (DMN). Aberrant brain activities in BECTS patients without IEDs were associated with cognitive areas of the brain. The strength of gamma oscillations in the chronic epilepsy state reflected the duration of BECTS. Significance: MEG could reveal the aberrant neural activities in BECTS patients during the interictal period, and such abnormality is frequency-dependent. Gamma oscillations could be used to identify BECTS patients without IEDs.

Retrieval of person knowledge and its generalization bring diverse judgments of facial attractiveness								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	5			505	515		10.1080/17470919.2020.1787223			SEP 2 2020	2020	Judgments of facial attractiveness play an important role in social interactions. However, it still remains unclear why these judgments are malleable. The present study aimed to understand whether the retrieval of person knowledge leads to different judgments of attractiveness of the same face. Event-related potentials and learning-recognition tasks were used to investigate the effects of person knowledge on facial attractiveness. The results showed that compared with familiar faces that were matched with negative person knowledge, those matched with positive person knowledge were evaluated as more attractive and evoked a larger early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive complex (LPC). Additionally, positive similar faces had the same behavioral results and evoked large LPC, while unfamiliar faces did not have any significant effects. These results indicate that the effect of person knowledge on facial attractiveness occurs from early to late stage of facial attractiveness processing, and this effect could be generalized based on the similarity of the face structure, which occurred at the late stage. This mechanism may explain why individuals form different judgments of facial attractiveness.

In the present study, we report a different type of unusual motor organization in a patient with a schizencephalic cleft in the right hemisphere and polymicrogyria in the opposite hemisphere. Despite similar brain pathology affecting the sensorimotor cortex, motor organization differed from previously known bilateral congenital brain lesions. We conducted a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion tensor image (DTI) study to confirm the motor organization. In this case, ipsilateral corticospinal projections to the paretic hands were observed during TMS of the less affected hemisphere, along with polymicrogyria, similar to the previous study. However, a crossed corticospinal tract to the paretic hand from the more severely affected hemisphere was observed in this case-a pattern of motor organization that has yet to be reported in this patient population. Our findings indicate that motor organization after early brain injury may be affected by the interhemispheric competition of the corticospinal system and bilateral brain lesions, thereby resulting in unilateral hemiparesis.

J	Lee, Mi Sook; Kim, Bo Seon								Effects of working memory intervention on language production by individuals with dementia								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				31	10			1557	1581		10.1080/09602011.2020.1789479			NOV 26 2021	2021	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of working memory intervention on language production by people with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 39 AD patients, 21 with mild AD and 18 with moderate AD and 18 normal controls were given 18 sessions of working memory intervention. After these sessions, the transfer effects and maintenance effects at the 3-month follow-up were assessed. A word-span task and a digit-span task were used to evaluate working memory. Language-production abilities were compared through four tasks: a verbal fluency, a confrontation naming, a word definition, and a picture-description task. Task performances of working memory and language production were the lowest in the baseline stage and the highest in the transfer-effect stage. The three groups had transfer effects in all tasks, while the maintenance effects were limited by groups and tasks. This study proves that working memory intervention for AD patients is effective for language production. In addition, we have paved the way for working memory intervention to improve language production by AD patients in clinical settings by presenting the transfer and maintenance effect for each task of language production.

Relational Memory at Short and Long Delays in Individuals With Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						270	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00270			JUL 10 2020	2020	Memory deficits are a common and frequently-cited consequence of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, we know less about how TBI influences relational memory, which allows the binding of the arbitrary elements of experience and the flexible use and recombination of relational representations in novel situations. Relational memory is of special interest for individuals with TBI, given the vulnerability of the hippocampus to injury mechanisms, as well as a growing body of literature establishing the role of relational memory in flexible and goal-directed behavior. In this study, participants with and without a history of moderate-severe TBI completed a continuous relational memory task for face-scene pairings. Participants with TBI exhibited a disruption in relational memory not only when tested after a delay, but also when tested with no experimenter-imposed delay after stimulus presentation. Further, canonical assessments of working and episodic memory did not correspond with performance on the face-scene task, suggesting that this task may tap into relational memory differently and with greater sensitivity than standardized memory assessments. These results highlight the need for rigorous assessment of relational memory in TBI, which is likely to detect deficits that have specific consequences for community reintegration and long-term functional outcomes.

In this study, the brain basis of sentence context effects on word understanding during reading was examined in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) using magnetoencephalography. The correlates of a history of developmental language delay in ASD were also investigated. Event related field responses at early (150 ms after the onset of a final word) and N400 latencies are reported for three different types of sentence final words: dominant homonyms, subordinate homonyms, and unambiguous words. Clear evidence for semantic access was found at both early and conventional N400 latencies in both TD participants and individuals with ASD with no history of language delay. By contrast, modulation of evoked activity related to semantic access was weak and not significant at early latencies in individuals with ASD with a history of language delay. The reduced sensitivity to semantic context in individuals with ASD and language delay was accompanied by strong right hemisphere lateralization at early and N400 latencies; such strong activity was not observed in TD individuals and individuals with ASD without a history of language delay at either latency. These results provide new evidence and support for differential neural mechanisms underlying semantic processing in ASD, and indicate that delayed language acquisition in ASD is associated with different lateralization and processing of language.

Wearable technology has improved the acceptability and objectivity of measuring activity for older adults in high-income countries. Nevertheless, the technology is under-utilized in low-to-middle income countries. The aim was to explore feasibility, acceptability and utility of wearable technology to measure walking activity in rural-dwelling, older Tanzanians. Methods A total of 65 participants (73.9 +/- 11.2 years), 36 non-frail and 29 frail, were assessed. Free-living data were recorded for 7 days with an accelerometer on the lower back. Data were analyzed via an automatic cloud-based pipeline: volume, pattern and variability of walking were extracted. Acceptability questionnaires were completed. T-tests were used for comparison between the groups. Results 59/65 datasets were analyzed. Questionnaires indicated that 15/65 (23.0%) experienced some therapeutic benefit from the accelerometer, 15/65 (23.0%) expected diagnostic benefit; 16/65 (24.6%) experienced symptoms while wearing the accelerometer (e.g. itching). Frail adults walked significantly less, had less variable walking patterns, and had a greater proportion of shorter walking bouts compared to the non-frail. Conclusion This study suggests that important contextual and practical limitations withstanding wearable technology may be feasible for measuring walking activity in older rural-dwelling adults in low-income settings, identifying those with frailty.

This study investigated poly-tobacco use among waterpipe smokers, and its effect on their quit intention. Methods Descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized to recruit a convenience sample of university students who used waterpipe in three East Mediterranean countries. Using an internet-based survey, data were collected regarding participants' demographics, use of alternative tobacco products and nicotine delivery systems, and waterpipe quitting profile.Results:A total of 2290 students agreed to participate, among which 1116 (45.3%) reported using at least one tobacco product beside waterpipe. Poly-tobacco use was highest (61.1%) in Egypt, followed by Jordan (45.1%) and Palestine (33.1%). Across countries, cigarettes were the most common product (45.2%,n = 924) followed by cigar (18.6%,n = 374) and e-shisha (17.5%,n = 353). Conversely, the least reported product was smokeless tobacco (7.5%,n = 151) preceded by regular pipe (9.5%,n = 193). Participants who were males (OR = 2.83, 95% CI: 2.18-3.65), older (22-29 years) (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09-1.22), unemployed (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.22-2.04), and those who initiated waterpipe at a younger age (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.87-0.91) had higher odds of being poly-smokers. Poly-tobacco users were significantly more resistant to quit waterpipe.Conclusion:This study demonstrates poly-tobacco use as a rising phenomenon among waterpipe smokers and highlights the necessity for initiating advanced interventions to help waterpipe poly-tobacco users quit this dangerous type of addiction. Various country-specific programs are needed considering the various products used by the users.

J	Mu, Eveline; Crewther, David								Occipital Magnocellular VEP Non-linearities Show a Short Latency Interaction Between Contrast and Facial Emotion								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						268	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00268			JUL 9 2020	2020	The magnocellular system has been implicated in the rapid processing of facial emotions, such as fear. Of the various anatomical possibilities, the retino-colliculo-pulvinar route to the amygdala is currently favored. However, it is not clear whether and when amygdala arousal activates the primary visual cortex (V1). Non-linear visual evoked potentials provide a well-accepted technique for examining temporal processing in the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in the visual cortex. Here, we investigated the relationship between facial emotion processing and the separable magnocellular (K2.1) and parvocellular (K2.2) components of the second-order non-linear multifocal visual evoked potential responses recorded from the occipital scalp (O-Z). Stimuli comprised pseudorandom brightening/darkening of fearful, happy, neutral faces (or no face) with surround patches decorrelated from the central face-bearing patch. For the central patch, the spatial contrast of the faces was 30% while the modulation of the per-pixel brightening/darkening was uniformly 10% or 70%. From 14 neurotypical young adults, we found a significant interaction between emotion and contrast in the magnocellularly driven K2.1 peak amplitudes, with greater K2.1 amplitudes for fearful (vs. happy) faces at 70% temporal contrast condition. Taken together, our findings suggest that facial emotional information is present in early V1 processing as conveyed by the M pathway, and more activated for fearful as opposed to happy and neutral faces. An explanation is offered in terms of the contest between feedback and response gain modulation models.

J	Tamburro, Gabriella; di Fronso, Selenia; Robazza, Claudio; Bertollo, Maurizio; Comani, Silvia								Modulation of Brain Functional Connectivity and Efficiency During an Endurance Cycling Task: A Source-Level EEG and Graph Theory Approach								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						243	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00243			JUL 9 2020	2020	Various methods have been employed to investigate different aspects of brain activity modulation related to the performance of a cycling task. In our study, we examined how functional connectivity and brain network efficiency varied during an endurance cycling task. For this purpose, we reconstructed EEG signals at source level: we computed current densities in 28 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) through the eLORETA algorithm, and then we calculated the lagged coherence of the 28 current density signals to define the adjacency matrix. To quantify changes of functional network efficiency during an exhaustive cycling task, we computed three graph theoretical indices: local efficiency (LE), global efficiency (GE), and density (D) in two different frequency bands, Alpha and Beta bands, that indicate alertness processes and motor binding/fatigue, respectively. LE is a measure of functional segregation that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information locally. GE is a measure of functional integration that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information globally. D is a global measure of connectivity that describes the extent of connectivity in a network. This analysis was conducted for six different task intervals: pre-cycling; initial, intermediate, and final stages of cycling; and active recovery and passive recovery. Fourteen participants performed an incremental cycling task with simultaneous EEG recording and rated perceived exertion monitoring to detect the participants' exhaustion. LE remained constant during the endurance cycling task in both bands. Therefore, we speculate that fatigue processes did not affect the segregated neural processing. We observed an increase of GE in the Alpha band only during cycling, which could be due to greater alertness processes and preparedness to stimuli during exercise. Conversely, although D did not change significantly over time in the Alpha band, its general reduction in the Beta bands during cycling could be interpreted within the framework of the neural efficiency hypothesis, which posits a reduced neural activity for expert/automated performances. We argue that the use of graph theoretical indices represents a clear methodological advancement in studying endurance performance.

Therefore, a semi-quantitative MRI (sqMRI) scale was used to explore whether identified brain lesions related to functional abilities and gait pathology in this population. A retrospective cohort of ambulatory children with spastic CP was selected [N= 104; 52 bilateral (bCP) and 52 unilateral (uCP)]. Extent and location-specific scores were defined according to the sqMRI scale guidelines. The gross motor function classification system (GMFCS), the gait profile score (GPS), GPSs per motion plane, gait variable scores (GVS) and multiple-joint (MJ) gait patterns were related to brain lesion scores. In all groups, the global total brain scores correlated to the GPS (total:r(s)= 0.404,p <= 0.001; bCP:r(s)= 0.335,p <= 0.05; uCP:r(s)= 0.493,p <= 0.001). The global total hemispheric scores correlated to the GMFCS (total:r(s)= 0.392,p <= 0.001; bCP:r(s)= 0.316,p <= 0.05; uCP:r(s)= 0.331,p <= 0.05). The laterality scores of the hemispheres in the total group correlated negatively to the GMFCS level (r(s)= -0.523,p <= 0.001) and the GVS-knee sagittal (r(s)= -0.311,p <= 0.01). Lesion location, for the total group demonstrated positive correlations between parietal lobe involvement and the GPS (r(s)= 0.321,p <= 0.001) and between periventricular layer damage and the GMFCS (r(s)= 0.348,p <= 0.001). Involvement of the anterior part of the corpus callosum (CC) was associated with the GVS-hip sagittal in all groups (total:r(pb)= 0.495,p <= 0.001; bCP:r(pb)= 0.357,p <= 0.05; uCP:r(pb)= 0.641,p <= 0.001). The global total hemispheric and laterality of the hemispheres scores differentiated between the minor and both the extension (p <= 0.001 andp <= 0.001) and flexion (p= 0.016 andp= 0.013, respectively) MJ patterns in the total group. Maximal periventricular involvement and CC intactness were associated with extension patterns (p <= 0.05 and p <= 0.001, respectively). Current findings demonstrated relationships between brain structure and motor function as well as pathological gait, in this cohort of children with CP. These results might facilitate the timely identification of gait pathology and, ultimately, guide individualized treatment planning of gait impairments in children with CP.

A Qualitative Exploration of Reasons for Injecting Alone: Perspectives from Young People Who Inject Drugs								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	13			2079	2086		10.1080/10826084.2020.1790008			OCT 1 2020	2020	Background Rates of death from opioid overdose continue to rise in the United States. One harm reduction strategy designed to reduce fatal overdose risk among people who inject drugs (PWID) is an advisory to not use drugs alone. However, the feasibility and acceptability of this message have not been evaluated.Objectives:This paper explores the drug use practices of young PWID related to injecting alone and reasons for doing so.Methods:From 2015 to 2016, 23 in-depth interviews were completed in Baltimore, Maryland with young PWID. Participants were recruited through street/venue-based outreach and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria were 1) age 18-30 and 2) self-report injection drug use in past 6 months. Participants were asked about drug use history, overdose knowledge/experiences, and injection-related practices including when, where, and with whom drugs were injected.Results:Injecting drugs alone was common among members of this sample. Reasons for injecting alone included 1) the desire to alleviate withdrawal symptoms, 2) feelings of shame regarding one's drug use, 3) lack of knowledge about Good Samaritan Laws, 4) financial circumstances, and 5) a lack of trusted peers with whom to inject, often due to disrupted social networks.Conclusions:Young PWID inject alone for a variety of reasons, putting them at increased risk of fatal overdose. These findings demonstrate that "don't use alone" messages may not be sufficient given the complex realities of PWID's injection practices. Harm reduction programs employing such messaging should also offer alternative options for overdose prevention/risk reduction for those who do inject alone.

The potential for patient harm presented by an impaired provider is the reason SUD in licensed healthcare professionals is a regulatory issue.Aim: This research study seeks to identify the differences in the disciplinary action taken among pharmacists, physicians, and nurses (LPN & RN) in 24 states.Methods:A retrospective secondary data analysis was performed using the public use data file of the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). Inclusion data were grouped and recoded to analyze using Chi-square to compare differences between groups.Results:Nurses are revoked and fined at much higher rates than medicine. Nurses and pharmacists are placed on probation at higher rates than medicine, and medicine was censured more than their nursing and pharmacy colleagues.Conclusions:Licensed healthcare professionals are punished differently for similar SUD-related offenses. Further research should explore these differences to identify evidenced based ways to protect the public while assisting this special at-risk population to recover from SUD.

Despite being a widely studied biosignal in auditory neuroscience, the neural underpinnings of the FFR are still unclear. Traditionally, FFR was associated with subcortical activity, but recent evidence suggested cortical contributions which may be dependent on the stimulus frequency. We combined electroencephalography (EEG) with an inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, the continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), to disentangle the cortical contribution to the FFR elicited to stimuli of high and low frequency. We recorded FFR to the syllable /ba/ at two fundamental frequencies (Low: 113 Hz; High: 317 Hz) in healthy participants. FFR, cortical potentials, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) were recorded before and after real and sham cTBS in the right primary auditory cortex. Results showed that cTBS did not produce a significant change in the FFR recorded, in any of the frequencies. No effect was observed in the ABR and cortical potentials, despite the latter known contributions from the auditory cortex. Possible reasons behind the negative results include compensatory mechanisms from the non-targeted areas, intraindividual variability of the cTBS effectiveness, and the particular location of our target area, the primary auditory cortex.

Cortical Activation During Shoulder and Finger Movements in Healthy Adults: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						260	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00260			JUL 8 2020	2020	Characterization of cortical activation patterns during movement of the upper extremity in healthy adults is helpful in understanding recovery mechanisms following neurological disorders. This study explores cortical activation patterns associated with movements of the shoulder and fingers in healthy adults using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twelve healthy right-handed participants were recruited. Two motor tasks (shoulder abduction and finger extension) with two different trial lengths (10 s and 20 s) were performed in a sitting position at a rate of 0.5 Hz. The hemodynamic response, as indicated by oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), over both hemispheres was acquired using a 54-channel fNIRS system. We found a generalized bilateral cortical activation during both motor tasks with greater activation in the contralateral compared to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. Particularly in the more medial part of the contralateral hemisphere, significant higher activation was found during the shoulder compared to finger movements. Furthermore, cortical activation patterns are affected not only by motor tasks but also by trial lengths. HbO is more sensitive to detect cortical activation during finger movements in longer trials, while HbR is a better surrogate to capture active areas during shoulder movement in shorter trials. Based on these findings, reporting both HbO and HbR is strongly recommended for future fNIRS studies, and trial lengths should be taken into account when designing experiments and explaining results. Our findings demonstrating distinct cortical activation patterns associated with shoulder and finger movements in healthy adults provide a foundation for future research to study recovery mechanisms following neurological disorders.

J	Archer, Kim; Pammer, Kristen; Vidyasagar, Trichur Raman								A Temporal Sampling Basis for Visual Processing in Developmental Dyslexia								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						213	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00213			JUL 8 2020	2020	Knowledge of oscillatory entrainment and its fundamental role in cognitive and behavioral processing has increasingly been applied to research in the field of reading and developmental dyslexia. Growing evidence indicates that oscillatory entrainment to theta frequency spoken language in the auditory domain, along with cross-frequency theta-gamma coupling, support phonological processing (i.e., cognitive encoding of linguistic knowledge gathered from speech) which is required for reading. This theory is called the temporal sampling framework (TSF) and can extend to developmental dyslexia, such that inadequate temporal sampling of speech-sounds in people with dyslexia results in poor theta oscillatory entrainment in the auditory domain, and thus a phonological processing deficit which hinders reading ability. We suggest that inadequate theta oscillations in the visual domain might account for the many magno-dorsal processing, oculomotor control and visual deficits seen in developmental dyslexia. We propose two possible models of a magno-dorsal visual correlate to the auditory TSF: (1) A direct correlate that involves "bottom-up" magnocellular oscillatory entrainment of the visual domain that occurs when magnocellular populations phase lock to theta frequency fixations during reading and (2) an inverse correlate whereby attending to text triggers "top-down" low gamma signals from higher-order visual processing areas, thereby organizing magnocellular populations to synchronize to a theta frequency to drive the temporal control of oculomotor movements and capturing of letter images at a higher frequency.

Purpose/Objectives:This trial intended to compare the effects of a previously evaluated internet intervention for people with problematic alcohol use when delivered with or without brief email guidance.Methods:Using online advertising, 238 participants, 18 years or older, were recruited and randomized to receive access to the Internet intervention Alcohol Help Center with or without brief email guidance from a health educator. The guidance consisted of at least four structured, slightly individualized emails delivered during the first two weeks after randomization. Participants were followed up at 3 and 6 months.Results:Number of log-ins did not differ significantly between groups throughout the follow-up period. The follow-up rate at 6 months was 47.0%. Generalized estimating equations run on the primary (standard drinks in preceding week/heavy drinking days in preceding week) and secondary outcome variables (AUDIT, AUDIT-C, quality of life) revealed no significant differences between the interventions on any of the outcomes.Conclusions/Importance:The study does not provide support for any added benefits of providing brief guidanceviaemail in an internet intervention for problem drinkers.

Repeated Cross-Sectional Multicenter Surveys in Germany and Hungary, 2016-2018								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	13			2109	2115		10.1080/10826084.2020.1790011			OCT 1 2020	2020	Background Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is gaining popularity among young adults. Medical students' nicotine use behavior is of particular interest because of their impending role in health promotion.Objectives:Aim of our study is to assess changes that occurred between 2016 and 2018 in the prevalence of e-cigarette use among medical students and to explore associations between e-cigarette use, demographic characteristics, and cigarette smoking. Self-administered questionnaire surveys were used to obtain cross-sectional data of medical students in Budapest and Pecs, Hungary, and Dresden, Germany.Results:Sample sizes for 2016 and 2018 were 2297 and 1514, respectively. In the whole sample, past-30-day use of e-cigarettes increased from 4.5% to 8.0% (p < 0.001). The increase in e-cigarette use was significant in both genders (from 3.6% to 5.6% among females,p = 0.028, and from 5.9 to 11.4% among males,p < 0.001). Prevalence of e-cigarette use was higher among Hungarian students than among German students (2.2% versus 5.7% in 2016, and 4.1% versus 10.5% in 2018,p < 0.05 for both years). There was no significant difference in e-cigarette use among different academic years. The ratio of e-cigarette users increased significantly among current cigarette smokers but not among nonsmokers. We could not detect a decrease in cigarette smoking.Conclusions:Prevalence of e-cigarette use increased significantly among medical students without a reduction in cigarette smoking. Medical schools should add the topic of e-cigarettes to their curricula and need to develop cessation programs to help their students quit both cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

The two hemispheres are thought to mutually hamper neuroplastic reorganization of the other hemisphere. The results of preceding degeneration and neuroplastic reorganization of white matter may be reflected by Diffusion Tensor Imaging-derived diffusivity parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA). In this study, we applied Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to contrast the white matter status of the contralesional hemisphere of young lesioned brains with and without contralateral influences by comparing patients after hemispherotomy to those who had not undergone neurosurgery. DTI was applied to 43 healthy controls (26 females, mean age +/- SD: 25.07 +/- 11.33 years) and two groups of in total 51 epilepsy patients with comparable juvenile brain lesions (32 females, mean age +/- SD: 25.69 +/- 12.77 years) either after hemispherotomy (30 of 51 patients) or without neurosurgery (21 of 51 patients), respectively. FA values were compared between these groups using the unbiased tract-based spatial statistics approach. A voxel-wise ANCOVA controlling for age at scan yielded significant group differences in FA. Apost hoc t-test between hemispherotomy patients and healthy controls revealed widespread supra-threshold voxels in the contralesional hemisphere of hemispherotomy patients indicating comparatively higher FA values (p< 0.05, FWE-corrected). The non-surgery group, in contrast, showed extensive supra-threshold voxels indicating lower FA values in the contralesional hemisphere as compared to healthy controls (p< 0.05, FWE-corrected). Whereas lower FA values are suggestive of pronounced contralesional degeneration in the non-surgery group, higher FA values in the hemispherotomy group may be interpreted as a result of preceding plastic remodeling. We conclude that, whether juvenile brain lesions are associated with contralesional degeneration or reorganization partly depends on the ipsilesional hemisphere. Contralesional reorganization as observed in hemispherotomy patients was most likely enabled by the complete neurosurgical deafferentation of the ipsilesional hemisphere and, thereby, the disinhibition of the neuroplastic potential of the contralesional hemisphere. The main argument of this study is that hemispherotomy may be seen as a major plastic stimulus and as a prerequisite for contralesional neuroplastic remodeling in patients with juvenile brain lesions.

MRI Insights Into Adolescent Neurocircuitry-A Vision for the Future								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						237	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00237			JUL 7 2020	2020	Adolescence is the time of onset of many psychiatric disorders. Half of pediatric patients present with comorbid psychiatric disorders that complicate both their medical and psychiatric care. Currently, diagnosis and treatment decisions are based on symptoms. The field urgently needs brain-based diagnosis and personalized care. Neuroimaging can shed light on how aberrations in brain circuits might underlie psychiatric disorders and their development in adolescents. In this perspective article, we summarize recent MRI literature that provides insights into development of psychiatric disorders in adolescents. We specifically focus on studies of brain structural and functional connectivity. Ninety-six included studies demonstrate the potential of MRI to assess psychiatrically relevant constructs, diagnose psychiatric disorders, predict their development or predict response to treatment. Limitations of the included studies are discussed, and recommendations for future research are offered. We also present a vision for the role that neuroimaging may play in pediatrics and primary care in the future: a routine neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric imaging (NPPI) protocol for adolescent patients, which would include a 30-min brain scan, a quality control and safety read of the scan, followed by computer-based calculation of the structural and functional brain network metrics that can be compared to the normative data by the pediatrician. We also perform a cost-benefit analysis to support this vision and provide a roadmap of the steps required for this vision to be implemented.

An International Survey of Deep Brain Stimulation Utilization in Asia and Oceania: The DBS Think Tank East								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						162	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00162			JUL 6 2020	2020	Introduction: To evaluate the current utilization and challenges in fully implementing the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment in Asia and Oceania. Methods: We conducted a medical literature search to identify DBS research performed by investigators with a primary affiliation in Asian and Oceania countries between March 1, 2013, and March 1, 2019, followed by an international survey-based study. Additionally, we obtained added information regarding the DBS challenges and opportunities from the technology/industry perspective within China and Japan. We also described the current situation of DBS in India. Results: Most publications (390/494; 78.95%) in the English language originated from East Asia. In West Asia, Turkey, Israel, and Iran accounted for most DBS publications. We found no publications from the remaining 35 Asian countries. Lack of community referrals to tertiary centers was identified as the most common limitation for the widespread use of DBS in Asia (68.97%). In China, despite an increasing number of centers performing DBS surgeries, most of them accomplished less than 10 cases per year. In contrast, the number of DBS cases in Japan has been decreasing. Centers offering DBS surgeries as well as corresponding fellowship training in India are limited. Conclusion: Appropriate referrals, access, infrastructure, and the presence of full multidisciplinary DBS teams are common limitations of DBS in Asia. Most centers in China, Japan, and India performed less than 10 cases per year and a future study is expected to address the impact on quality in centers performing such few cases.

Drug overdose deaths increased by 21% from 2015 to 2016, with two-thirds of these deaths attributed to opioid use disorder (OUD). This study assessed the psycho-social correlates associated with OUD over 2015-2018 in the US.Methods:This study used data collected from 171,766 (weighted = 245,838,163) eligible non-institutionalized US adults in the pooled National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2015-2018. Survey-weighted descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the psycho-social correlates of OUD.Results:About 0.85% of the respondents reported having OUD in the past year. About one-quarter (26.3%), one-sixth (14.8%), and half (47.3%) of the respondents with OUD reported alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine dependence, respectively. One-sixth (16.7%) had a criminal justice involvement history, and almost one-third (30.8%) experienced a major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year. In multivariable analysis, <= 64 years, White race, male gender, lower educational attainment, unemployment, large metro area residence, history of alcohol, marijuana, nicotine use disorder, history of criminal justice involvement, and MDE in previous year were associated with higher odds of OUD. In contrast, being married, non-Hispanic African American, non-Hispanic Other, and Hispanic ethnicity, good physical health, private health insurance, and higher risk perception about addictive substance use were associated with lower odds of OUD.Conclusions:OUD is more prevalent among certain sociodemographic groups in the US. Targeted interventions focusing on young, White, unmarried, male, and uninsured/Medicaid/Medicare populations should be implemented to reduce the OUD.

Using data from the ASSIST V3.1 measurement tool, the incidence of problematic and non-problematic tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use was described as a percentage of respondents in each group. Hierarchical regression assessed the impact of demographic variables, sexual orientation, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and level of substance use. Multiple regression assessed the impact of general stressors, minority stress processes, including coping and social support and internalized homophobia, on level of substance use.Results:The incidence of PSU was higher in this population of LGB-identified nurses than previously described in either the general population of nurses or the general LGB population. Demographic variables and minority status had variable associations with level of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use. Components of Meyer's minority stress model had a stronger and more consistent association with level of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use than general stress. Predictors of level of substance use across groups suggest community involvement may be significant. These results have potential implications for public health and the prevention and treatment of substance use in LGB-identified nurses.

Functional Analysis of Continuous, High-Resolution Measures in Aging Research: A Demonstration Using Cerebral Oxygenation Data From the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						261	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00261			JUL 3 2020	2020	Background: A shift towards the dynamic measurement of physiologic resilience and improved technology incorporated into experimental paradigms in aging research is producing high-resolution data. Identifying the most appropriate analysis method for this type of data is a challenge. In this work, the functional principal component analysis (fPCA) was employed to demonstrate a data-driven approach to the analysis of high-resolution data in aging research. Methods: Cerebral oxygenation during standing was measured in a large cohort [The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA)]. FPCA was performed on tissue saturation index (TSI) data. A regression analysis was then conducted with the functional principal component (fPC) scores as the explanatory variables and transition time as the response. Results: The mean +/- SD age of the analysis sample was 64 +/- 8 years. Females made up 54% of the sample and overall, 43% had tertiary education. The first PC explained 96% of the variance in cerebral oxygenation upon standing and was related to a baseline shift. Subsequent components described the recovery to before-stand levels (fPC2), drop magnitude and initial recovery (fPC3 and fPC4) as well as a temporal shift in the location of the minimum TSI value (fPC5). Transition time was associated with components describing the magnitude and timing of the nadir. Conclusions: Application of fPCA showed utility in reducing a large amount of data to a small number of parameters which summarize the inter-participant variation in TSI upon standing. A demonstration of principal component regression was provided to allow for continued use and development of data-driven approaches to high-resolution data analysis in aging research.

J	Himmelberger, Zachary M.; Merrill, Edward C.; Conners, Frances A.; Roskos, Beverly; Yang, Yingying; Robinson, Trent								The Acquisition of Survey Knowledge by Individuals With Down Syndrome								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						256	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00256			JUL 3 2020	2020	People with Down syndrome often exhibit deficiencies in wayfinding activities, particularly route learning (e.g.,Courbois et al., 2013;Davis et al., 2014;Farran et al., 2015). Evidence concerning more sophisticated survey learning has been sparse. In the research reported here, two experiments are reported that evaluated survey learning of youth with DS and typically developing children (TD) matched on mental age. In Experiment 1, participants learned two overlapping routes consisting of three turns each through a virtual environment depicting 9 square city blocks. Following acquisition, they were tested on multiple measures of survey knowledge: finding a shortcut, identifying the direction of landmarks not currently visible from their location in the environment, and recognizing a bird's-eye representation of the overall environment. Under these conditions, which should provide relatively optimal opportunities for survey learning, the participants with DS performed comparably to TD participants matched on non-verbal ability on all of our measures of survey learning. Hence, we concluded that people with DS can acquire some survey knowledge when tasked with learning a small environment and given the opportunity to do so. In Experiment 2, the experimenter navigated participants through a large, relatively complex, virtual environment along a circuitous path, beginning and ending at a target landmark. Then, the participants were placed at a pre-specified location in the environment that they had viewed previously and instructed to navigate to the same target (a door) using the shortest possible path from their current location. They completed the task three times: once after being shown the environment one time, once after three exposures, and once after five exposures. Results indicated that the participants with DS exhibited significantly less skill at identifying the shortcut than did the TD participants, with differences emerging as the number of exposures increased. Participants with DS were also less able to recall landmarks at the end of the experiment. Overall, however, the performance of both groups was relatively poor in both experiments - with the performance of participants with DS being worse as conditions became less optimal. These results were discussed in terms of underlying mechanisms that may account for variations in survey learning as environmental complexity increases.

Predicting Cognitive Load and Operational Performance in a Simulated Marksmanship Task								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						222	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00222			JUL 3 2020	2020	Modern operational environments can place significant demands on a service member's cognitive resources, increasing the risk of errors or mishaps due to overburden. The ability to monitor cognitive burden and associated performance within operational environments is critical to improving mission readiness. As a key step toward a field-ready system, we developed a simulated marksmanship scenario with an embedded working memory task in an immersive virtual reality environment. As participants performed the marksmanship task, they were instructed to remember numbered targets and recall the sequence of those targets at the end of the trial. Low and high cognitive load conditions were defined as the recall of three- and six-digit strings, respectively. Physiological and behavioral signals recorded included speech, heart rate, breathing rate, and body movement. These features were input into a random forest classifier that significantly discriminated between the low- and high-cognitive load conditions (AUC = 0.94). Behavioral features of gait were the most informative, followed by features of speech. We also showed the capability to predict performance on the digit recall (AUC = 0.71) and marksmanship (AUC = 0.58) tasks. The experimental framework can be leveraged in future studies to quantify the interaction of other types of stressors and their impact on operational cognitive and physical performance.

Methods: In a single-blind, sham-controlled study, we assessed both 50% and 60% of the resting motor threshold (RMT) over the right DLPFC in healthy right-handed (n= 42) adults using cognitive function, such as attention and memory, as a measureviaCANTAB. Results: We observed an improvement in the cognitive function level during the use of online low intensities of 50% and 60% RMT active stimulation of the DLPFC compared to the sham stimulation. Conclusions: The results showed that low-intensity TMS can indeed effectively modulate cognitive function in DLPFC. Future research is, however, necessary to investigate the potential effects of low-intensity TMS on different brain areas to increase confidence in the observed results.

Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 individuals. Participants were healthy older adults and older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who had participated in the memory group five years previously. Transcripts were analysed for emergent themes in a workshop, using the Most Significant Change technique. The focus group derived four major themes relating to participants' experiences of change. Particularly noteworthy were themes describing a process of acceptance and normalising of memory difficulties in older age, as well as enhancement of coping and self-efficacy. The results highlight the importance of group support for older adults with and without objective memory impairment. Memory groups may use the group format to full advantage by (a) enhancing participants' experiences of universality to alleviate distress and promote coping, and (b) developing group norms to promote positive ageing, encompassing enhanced acceptance and self-efficacy.

To characterize chorea's impact on everyday functioning and HRQOL and identify patterns of perception and experiences of chorea among patients, caregivers, and providers. Data from focus groups of individuals with manifest HD (n = 8 early-stage HD; n = 16 late-stage HD), individuals at-risk or prodromal HD (n = 16), family HD caregivers (n = 17), and HD clinicians (n = 25). Focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed via constant comparison to identify meaningful and salient themes of living with chorea. Global themes of chorea's impact identified included: watching for chorea, experiences of stigma, and constraints on independence and relationships. Themes distinct to specific respondent groups included: Vigilance (at risk, prodromal); adaptation to chorea (early-stage); loss of autonomy and social life (late-stage); monitoring engagement (family caregivers) and safety (clinical providers). Living with chorea significantly constrains daily functioning, interactions, and HRQOL across the HD disease spectrum. Addressing these impacts via appropriate management of chorea can potentially enhance functioning, HRQOL, and overall satisfaction for persons with HD and their families.

The four treatment arms were: (1) Psychoeducation control, (2) Self-administered computerized CR, (3) Interdisciplinary CR, and (4) Interdisciplinary CR integrated with CBT. Outcome was assessed across time (baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-treatment) for three domains: psychological (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised; SCL-90-R), cognitive (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; PASAT), and functional/behavioural (Key Behaviors Change Inventory; KBCI). Mixed model ANOVAs tested for self-efficacy differences across time in treatment responders versus non-responders, as defined by reliable change indices. A significant interaction was found on the SCL-90 such that responders had increasing self-efficacy with respect to psychological symptoms across four time points, whereas non-responders' self-efficacy did not change. Perceived self-efficacy at the beginning of treatment was associated with treatment engagement within the psychological domain for responders only, suggesting a mediating role in treatment outcome. Overall, results suggest that increasing patients' level of self-efficacy may be important for successful treatment of psychological distress in those with remote concussion.

We compared the performance on the programme of children with TBI (TBI Intervention Group) to children who had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD Intervention Group), a TBI Art group and a TBI No-intervention Group (n=5 in each group) in this preliminary study. Children in the two Intervention Groups participated in the "Pay Attention!" programme for 45 minutes twice a week for 12 weeks. All children were aged 6-8 years and underwent neuropsychological testing pre- and post-intervention. Behavioural data were collected from parents. Children in the ADHD Intervention Group showed individual clinically significant attentional improvements on measures of the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II using the Reliable Change Index (>= 2.58 SD). Despite mixed results, the pilot study demonstrates that implementing a cognitive rehabilitation programme in South Africa is feasible and necessary, despite limited infrastructure and access to resources.

However, the psychological processes that underpin this relationship are less well understood. The present research extends this work by testing a theoretically derived model about the role of multiple social group belonging in contributing to improved self-regulation and depression symptoms. A cross sectional survey was conducted involving 50 adults with ABI (M-age = 45 years, SD = 12.10; range 22-67 years) who completed a series of self-report measures indexing social group membership, self-regulation, and depression. Support for the predicted model was found with mediation analysis showing that multiple group belonging predicted lowered depression symptoms, by providing a basis for enhancing self-regulation. The findings suggest that belonging to multiple groups provides individuals with multiple opportunities for social interaction with which to trial and develop self-regulatory skills, which, in turn, has a positive influence on depression.

To address this gap, a multi-centre observational study was conducted of all active clients with severe TBI from the 11 community rehabilitation services (n = 588) of the New South Wales Brain Injury Rehabilitation Program. Demographic, injury, clinical and vocational data were collected by treating clinicians employing a purpose-designed protocol. New employment constituted almost 40% of competitive employment outcomes. Clients accessing new employment were significantly more likely to be younger, single, less educated, with more severe injuries and more likely to be displaying challenging behaviours than those resuming pre-injury work. Kaplan-Meier analyses found time to RTW was significantly longer for new employment. Stability of new employment was significantly poorer with jobs twice as likely to break down compared to previous employment. New employment positions were also more likely to be part-time and unskilled compared to previous employment. The results found that placement into new employment made a substantial contribution to employment outcomes after TBI but requires more intensive and tailored programmes to meet the multiple clinical and workplace challenges.

Research has reported several different factor structures for the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI, Frisch, 1994). We compared the fit of existing factor models and examined the clinical utility of the QOLI's factors in a sample of Australian adults with TBI. Archival data from 901 participants were provided by the Neurotrauma Register of Tasmania. Participants were aged 16-80 years and 63% were male. Approximately 69% had mild TBI (PTA < 24 h), approximately 24% had moderate TBI (PTA >1 day, <7 days) and 7% had severe TBI. Both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses were utilized, as participants provided data at one or more of seven time-points, up to 3 years following injury. The results showed the data best fitted a three-factor model, comprising Self-functioning and activity, Self-actualization and Family and environment factors, and a second order Overall QOL factor. Differences in the trajectory of recovery were noted between the QOLI factor scores over time and in relation to demographic and injury variables. In conclusion, the three-factor structure of the QOLI provided useful clinical information about the recovery of patients' subjective quality of life following TBI.		[Troup, G. A.; Thomas, M.

This study investigated whether established rating scales for evaluating conversations of people with TBI are reliable for use over videoconferencing. Nineteen participants with TBI and their communication partners completed two conversation samples during both in-person (IP) and videoconferencing-based (VC) assessment, with randomised order of assessment. Independent clinicians evaluated the conversations using the Adapted Measure of Participation in Conversation (MPC), the Adapted Measure of Support in Conversation (MSC) and the Global Impression scales. Comparisons between IP and VC ratings identified no significant differences on the MPC, MSC, and four out of five of the Global Impression scales. There was a significant difference between IP and VC recordings for "Task Completion" (p = .047), with participants performing significantly better in VC ratings. Inter-rater reliability was fair to excellent for the MPC and Global Impression scales for both IP and VC recordings. For the MSC scale, inter-rater reliability was poor to excellent. This study confirms the potential for using videoconferencing for evaluating conversations of people with TBI. Further development of training and rating procedures for these scales could facilitate more frequent and reliable use of these measures.

Recently, a revised version of the tool has been proposed (DEX-R). The current study aimed to examine the factorial validity of the Greek DEX-R, the level of agreement between the self and informant rating versions and the effect of age on each dysexecutive symptoms component. The questionnaire was administered to a sample of older adults (n = 235) and to a sample of informants (n = 187) in the context of the Neurocognitive Study for the Aging in Cyprus. Confirmatory Factor Analysis results showed that dysexecutive symptoms can be grouped into three underlying components or factors: (a) Motivation and Attention, (b) Flexibility, Fluency and Working Memory, and (c) Social Self-Regulation. Overall, the elderly reported more symptoms than their relatives, however the difference was significant only for the Flexibility, Fluency and Working memory factor. In a structural equation model, a weak positive effect of age was observed on the Flexibility, Fluency and Working Memory factor, based on the informant ratings. This study provides empirical evidence about the use of the DEX-R questionnaire in the Greek-speaking elderly population as a valid and reliable measure of everyday dysexecutive symptoms.

The groups were well matched in baseline characteristics. Everyday memory was assessed at baseline immediately post-intervention (8 weeks) and five weeks post-intervention. The experimental group received cognitive rehabilitation programme in 1-hour sessions on a weekly basis for 8 weeks. The placebo group received relaxation techniques on a weekly basis for eight weeks and the control group received no intervention. The results indicated that a cognitive rehabilitation programme had a positive effect on the everyday memory of patients in the experimental group post-intervention. However, there was no significant effect of intervention 5 weeks post-intervention.

Recently, many state-of-the-art approaches have been proposed for decoding action intention understanding. Although these methods have some advantages, it is still necessary to design other tools that can more efficiently classify the action intention understanding signals. New Method:Based on EEG, we first applied phase lag index (PLI) and weighted phase lag index (WPLI) to construct functional connectivity matrices in five frequency bands and 63 micro-time windows, then calculated nine graph metrics from these matrices and subsequently used the network metrics as features to classify different brain signals related to action intention understanding. Results:Compared with the single methods (PLI or WPLI), the combination method (PLI+WPLI) demonstrates some overwhelming victories. Most of the average classification accuracies exceed 70%, and some of them approach 80%. In statistical tests of brain network, many significantly different edges appear in the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions. Conclusions:Weighted brain networks can effectively retain data information. The integrated method proposed in this study is extremely effective for investigating action intention understanding. Both the mirror neuron and mentalizing systems participate as collaborators in the process of action intention understanding.

Home-based online cognitive training may have the potential to provide an efficient and effective way to improve attentional functions in such patients. Little work has been carried out to assess the efficacy of this approach in stroke patients, and the lack of studies with active control conditions and rigorous evaluations of cognitive functioning pre and post-training means understanding is limited as to whether and how such interventions may be effective. Here, in a feasibility pilot study, we compare the effects of 20 days of cognitive training using either novel Selective Attention Training (SAT) or commercial Working Memory Training (WMT) programme, versus a waitlist control on a range of attentional and working memory tasks. We demonstrate separable effects of each training condition, with SAT leading to improvements in spatial and non-spatial aspects of attention and WMT leading to improvements on closely related working memory tasks. In addition, both training groups reported improvements in everyday functioning, which were associated with improvements in attention, suggesting that improving attention may be of particular importance in maximising functional improvements in this patient group.

We hypothesised that reporting of early and late enduring-type PCS symptomatology (self-reported symptoms) would be significantly and negatively associated with: (a) an active "approach" coping style and (b) the belief that the injury would have negative consequences on the respondent's life. Using a prospective observational design we assessed 61 pre-morbidly healthy individuals who were admitted to hospital after an mTBI. Participants were assessed with measures of coping style and illness perception as well as PCS, depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptomatology. After controlling for current psychological distress, approach coping style significantly and independently predicted the severity of self-reported symptoms for early-type PCS symptomatology, but not late enduring-type PCS symptoms. The extent to which the respondent believed their symptoms were due to the mTBI significantly and independently predicted both early and late enduringtype PCS symptoms. This study indicates that different patterns of coping and illness perceptions are associated with early vs. late enduring types of PCS symptoms; this may have implications for the treatment of post-injury self-reported symptoms.

Relationship continuity and person-centred care: An exploratory mixed-methods investigation of spousal partners' responses to the challenging care needs of those with acquired brain injury								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				30	6			1169	1189		10.1080/09602011.2019.1566078			JUL 2 2020	2020	Some partners of people with an acquired brain injury experience the person with the injury and their relationship as continuous with the pre-injury person and relationship, but others experience the person and relationship as very different to what went before. Previous qualitative research has suggested that the experience of continuity may promote a more person-centred approach to how partners respond to challenging care needs. Given the value of triangulating evidence, this exploratory study used a mixed-methods design to investigate this suggestion. Twenty-six partners of people with an acquired brain injury completed the Birmingham Relationship Continuity Measure and a semi-structured interview about their response to challenging care needs. Interviews were coded and scored to provide a measure of the extent to which the participants' understanding, management and emotional responses showed a person-centred approach. The findings supported the hypothesis. Greater continuity was significantly correlated with a more person-centred approach. Associating relationship continuity and person-centred care is a novel approach to the issue of how family relationships may impact on care quality. Person-centred care can have important benefits for both the giver and receiver of care. Whether it can be promoted through fostering a sense of continuity in the relationship merits further investigation.

J	Huang, Lei; Zhang, Xinyue; Xu, Aman								Marijuana Use for Women: To Prescribe or Not to Prescribe								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	12			2076	2077		10.1080/10826084.2020.1782938			SEP 1 2020	2020	Background:The marijuana policy varies greatly worldwide. Marijuana use is illegal in most countries. Nevertheless, the medical potentials of marijuana have been increasingly uncovered, and its use by women is increasing.Objectives:Herein we aimed to share some of our perspectives on the hot important topic: marijuana use for women.Methods:We reviewed publications indexed in PubMed reporting the benefits and harms regarding the medical use of marijuana for women and its impact on offspring.Results:For non-pregnant women with some long-lasting conditions refractory to regular management, marijuana could be prescribed as potential new hope with acceptable safety profile based on current evidence. However, the side-effects especially long-term consequences are cautionary. For instance, for adolescents and young women, cannabis might affect their neuronal development and increase stroke risk. Notably, cannabinoids might promote proliferation of breast cancer cells. The potential harms should be carefully weighed against the benefits associated with cannabis. Cannabis use in pregnant or lactating women increases the risks of offspring exposures, and should be mostly avoided. Prenatal marijuana exposure might affect fetal growth and be teratogenic. The psychoactive cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a partial agonist of human endocannabinoid system, could cross placental barrier, and adversely affect fetus brain development. THC could also affect the maturation of multiple neurotransmitter systems. The neurobehavioral consequences include impaired arousal and psychomotor functions at birth and disturbed sleep and higher-order executive functions in childhood. For mothers, the short-term and long-term side-effects, withdrawal syndromes, and use disorder associated with use of marijuana especially high-potency cannabis could all adversely affect their ability to care children and thus child development and safety. However, if the disease itself more dramatically tortures maternal behavior which could otherwise be alleviated by marijuana, then the use could somehow be justified.Conclusions:Benefits and risks for both the patient and the offspring especially in the long term regarding marijuana use should be carefully weighed for each specific case. Standardized dosing and duration of treatment need to be determined. Recommendations should be made by physicians with expert training and after careful patient evaluation for fully informed patients, whose preference should be respected. Legislations should encourage more active basic, translational, and clinical studies.

Psychological Health Among Armed Forces Doctors During COVID-19 Pandemic in India								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	4			374	378		10.1177/0253717620934037			JUL 2020	2020	Background: A pandemic poses a significant challenge to the healthcare staff and infrastructure. We studied the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among armed forces doctors in India during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that contribute to these symptoms. Methods: The study was conducted from March 30, 2020, to April 2, 2020, using a self-administered questionnaire questionnaire using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), which was sent through Google Forms. Responses were received from 769 respondents. Data were analyzed for demographic details and HADS scores using the chi-square test and backward logistic regression. Results: Anxiety and depressive symptoms were seen in 35.2% and 28.2% of the doctors, respectively. In doctors with anxiety symptoms, significant associations were observed with age (20-35 years, 39.4%, P = 0.01), gender (females, 44.6%, P < 0.001), duration of service (0-10 years, 38%, P = 0.03), and clinical versus non-clinical specialties (non-clinical, 41.3%, P < 0.001) as opposed to marital status, education level, and current department of work. In doctors with depressive symptoms, significant associations were observed with age (P = 0.04), clinical versus non-clinical specialties (P < 0.001), duration of service (0-10 years, 30.1%, P = 0.03), and doctoral degree (P = 0.04) as opposed to gender, marital status, education level, and current working department. Conclusion: The study revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among armed forces doctors. The main contributing factors are female gender, young age group, non-clinical specialties, and having a doctoral degree.

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are among the many groups of people who are in the frontline and facing a risk of direct exposure to the virus. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms among HCPs of India. Methods: It was a cross-sectional, online survey conducted in April 2020 among HCPs who are directly involved in the triage, screening, diagnosing, and treatment of COVID-19 patients and suspects. Stress was estimated using Cohen's perceived stress scale. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the tools Public Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Predictors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. Results: A total of 433 online responses were obtained, and N = 350 were finally included. The prevalence (95% CI) of HCPs with high-level stress was 3.7% (2.2, 6.2), while the prevalence rates of HCPs with depressive symptoms requiring treatment and anxiety symptoms requiring further evaluation were 11.4% (8.3, 15.2) and 17.7% (13.9, 22.1), respectively. Women had approximately two times the increased odds of developing moderate- or high-level stress, depressive symptoms requiring treatment, and anxiety symptoms requiring further evaluation. Similarly, women staying in a hostel/temporary accommodation had two times the increased odds of developing depression or anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms among HCPs in India during the pandemic is comparable with other countries.

We aimed to assess the stress and psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among FHCWs. Methods: This was an exploratory hospital-based study. A semistructured e-questionnaire was developed and shared through emails, WhatsApp groups, Facebook, and Twitter. The study instruments used were stress questionnaire and the impact of event scale-revised. Results: We received 133 valid responses. A total of 81 (61.4%) of the respondents were single, 74 (55.6) were male, 70 (52.6%) were between 20 and 29 years of age, and 91 (68.4%) were from urban background. A total of 83 (62.4%) of respondents were doctors and 28 (21.1%) were registered nurses. A total of 36 (27.1%) were posted in emergency and 34 (25.6%) were in the in-patient department. Feeling sad and pessimistic, feeling of being avoided by others, the burden of change in the quality of work, and worrying whether the family will be cared for in their absence were significantly more in nurses as compared to the doctors. Stress due to burden in an increase in the quantity of work was seen more in FHCWs working in the swab collection center as compared to those working in the in-patient department, emergency, or theaters. Severe psychological impact was seen in 81 (60.9%) of FHCWs. The psychological impact was significantly more in males and in those who were married. It was also significantly related to the place of posting. Conclusion: More than half of the FHCWs had a severe psychological impact owing to COVID-19. The psychological impact was more in males and those who were married, and it was related to the place of posting of the FHCWs. Nurses had significantly higher stress as compared to doctors.

The SD is a descriptive statistic that estimates the scatter of values around the sample mean; hence, the SD describes the sample. In contrast, the SEM is an estimate of how close the sample mean is to the population mean; it is an intermediate term in the calculation of the 95% confidence interval around the mean, and (where applicable) statistical significance; the SEM does not describe the sample. Therefore, the mean should always be accompanied by the SD when describing the sample. There are many reasons why the SEM continues to be reported, and it is argued that none of these is justifiable. In fact, presentation of SEMs may mislead readers into believing that the sample data are more precise than they actually are. Given that the standard error is not presented for other parameters, such as difference between means or proportions, and difference between proportions, it is suggested that presentation of SEM values can be done away with, altogether.

This increase in use among the young females is of concern as they experience poorer outcomes and a higher risk for addiction. Hence, we aimed to examine the gender-specific correlates of alcohol use among college students in the district of Ernakulum, Kerala. Methods: From 58 colleges, 5,784 students completed a self-administered questionnaire that assessed use of alcohol, use of tobacco and illicit drugs, psychological distress, suicidality, symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and history of sexual abuse. Results: Of the questionnaires, 342 had incomplete responses and had to be discarded, and the rest (n = 5,442, 94.1%) were analyzed. lifetime alcohol use was reported by 39% males and 12.6% females. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis using a full model, male students using alcohol compared to male non-users were older, non-Muslim, had poor academic performance, and used other substances. Female users, compared to female non-users, were non-Muslim, had urban residence, used tobacco, and had higher psychological distress, higher suicidal thoughts, and higher lifetime exposure to sexual abuse. Conclusion: Gender-specific differences extend across sociodemographic and psychological domains. Incorporation of these may improve the effectiveness of public health strategies addressing alcohol use.

Barriers and Enablers to Tobacco Cessation Among Head and Neck Cancer Patients from a Tertiary Cancer Center in South india								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	4			346	352		10.1177/0253717620930317			JUL 2020	2020	Background: Tobacco use contributes to almost 40% of the cancers in India. Considering the potential threat, many preventive measures have been instigated in the country. However, tobacco cessation for hospitalized cancer patients is an unexplored territory in India. This study aims to understand the quit status and to explore the reasons to quit or continue the use of tobacco after the diagnosis of head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods: HNC patients admitted between February and April 2016 were assessed for their tobacco use status. A DT was used to assess the psychological distress. Users were assessed for their readiness to quit and dependence on tobacco. An in-depth interview was conducted among 25 patients (seven current users and 18 recent quitters), and themes that emerged were discussed. Results: Of the 119 HNC patients, 71 were tobacco users and 48 had quit tobacco after the diagnosis. The reasons to quit were the perceived benefits of quitting, advice from the physicians, and awareness about cancer and its association with tobacco. In contrast, the reasons to continue the use of tobacco were attributed to coping mechanisms, nihilistic perception about the outcome of the cancer, and a lack of understanding about cancer and its association with tobacco. Conclusion: The recent quitters comprehended the benefits of quitting and were able to prioritize their needs after the diagnosis. However, one-third of the HNC patients continued to use tobacco even after the diagnosis of cancer. Hence, tobacco cessation services need to be integrated into oncology services for achieving better treatment outcomes.

Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2).Results:Compared with nonmedical health workers (n= 1,255), medical health workers (n= 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%,p< 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%,p< 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%;p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%;p< 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%;p< 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p <= 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p< 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p< 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p< 0.01 or 0.05).Conclusions:During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them. They were in need of attention and recovery programs.

To this aim, patients with neglect (n = 7) and patients with neglect associated with hemianopia (n = 12) were exposed to a course of audio-visual stimulation with spatially and temporally coincident audio-visual pairs of stimuli for 10 daily training sessions (4 h of training per day), over two weeks. Performance on neuropsychological tests assessing neglect was measured before training, immediately after the training and months after the training at a follow-up session. The results showed significant post-training improvements in clinical signs of neglect, which were stable at the follow-up. These findings suggest that intensive and prolonged multisensory audio-visual stimulation affects orientation towards the neglected hemifield, therefore inducing long-term improvements in visual exploration and neglect symptoms in both patients with neglect and patients with neglect associated with hemianopia. Previous evidence from hemianopic patients suggests that these post-training effects might be mediated by activity in spared subcortical structures, such as the superior colliculus, which are relevant to multisensory integrative processing and spatial orientation.

Palliative Care Training for Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Fellows: A National Survey Project								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	4			336	342					JUL-AUG 2020	2020	Background: Provision of palliative care is part of the standard of care for patients with serious, life-limiting medical illnesses. Patients in the palliative care setting have high rates of psychiatric co-morbidity. However, integration of mental health care into palliative care remains a significant gap. With appropriate training, consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists are well-positioned to improve integration of mental health into palliative care. Purpose: To understand current palliative care training practices for C-L psychiatry fellows in the United States. Method: We invited all U.S. C-L psychiatry fellowship program directors to participate in a 17-item online structured survey aimed at understanding palliative care training in their fellowship programs. Results: 37161 (61%) of C-L psychiatry fellowship program directors responded to the survey. Eighty-six percent of programs provide some palliative care didactics, but the topics covered vary widely. Programs are closely split between offering a required, elective, or no clinical palliative care experiences. Only about half (45%) of programs identify formal opportunities for interaction between palliative care and C-L psychiatry fellows. Program directors identified topics such as goals-of-care discussions, systems issues in endof-life care, and pain management as important for fellows to learn. Barriers to teaching these topics included time, lack of teaching faculty, and disciplinary siloes. Conclusions: Although C-L psychiatry fellowship program directors identify a number of key teaching topics in palliative care for C-L psychiatry fellows, there are wide discrepancies in the depth and content of existing palliative care didactic and clinical experiences in C-L psychiatry fellowships.

Benzodiazepines, commonly used for withdrawal management, pose unique challenges in this population given the high prevalence of head trauma and delirium. Phenobarbital is an antiepileptic drug that offers a viable alternative to benzodiazepines for AWS treatment. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of patients with active alcohol use disorder who presented to a level 1 trauma center over a 4-year period and required medication-assisted management for AWS. The primary outcome variable examined was the development of AWS and associated complications. Additional outcomes measured included hospital length of stay, mortality, and medication-related adverse events. Results: Of the 85 patients in the study sample, 52 received a fixed-dose benzodiazepine-based protocol and 33 received phenobarbital-based protocol. In the benzodiazepine-based protocol group, 25 patients (48.2%) developed AWD and 38 (73.1%) developed uncomplicated AWS, as compared to 0 patients in the phenobarbital-based protocol (P = 0.0001). There were 10 (19.2%) patients with medication adverse side effects in the benzodiazepine-based protocol group versus 0 patients in the phenobarbital-based protocol group. There were no statically significant differences between the 2 groups as pertains to rates of other AWS-related complications, patient mortality, or length of stay. Conclusion: The use of a phenobarbital-based protocol in trauma patients with underlying active alcohol use disorder resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of AWD and uncomplicated AWS secondary to AWS when compared to patients treated with a fixed-dose benzodiazepine-based protocol.

The impact of depression and anxiety on opioid use has not been well characterized. This is of significance as the opioid epidemic continues, and over 60% of deaths secondary to drug overdose involve the use of opioids. Objective: In this retrospective, single-center study of 275 patients who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (allogeneic and autologous) for hematological malignancies, we explore the impact of depression and anxiety on opioid use. Results: Patients who were both anxious and depressed at admission for HCT had increased odds of receiving an opioid (odds ratio of 4.50 [95% confidence interval: 1.75, 11.56]) compared with patients who were neither depressed nor anxious. However, patients who were either depressed or anxious did not have different odds of receiving an opioid compared with those who were neither depressed nor anxious. Autologous HCT recipients had reduced odds of receiving an opioid (odds ratio of 0.17 [95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.38]) compared with patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. Patients with lower Karnofsky performance status (<90 on a scale of 1-100) had an increased incidence of receiving a higher Morphine milligram equivalent daily dosage (incidence rate ratio of 2.59 [95% confidence interval: 1.18, 5.67]) when modeled by zero truncated negative binomial regression. Conclusion: Presence of depression and anxiety impacts opioid use in patients undergoing HCT.

Cognitive Remediation Therapy Does Not Enhance Treatment Effect in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Anorexia Nervosa: A Randomized Controlled Trial								PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS				89	4			228	241		10.1159/000505733			JUL 2020	2020	Background:Guideline-recommended therapies are moderately successful in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anorexia nervosa (AN), leaving room for improvement. Cognitive inflexibility, a common trait in both disorders, is likely to prevent patients from engaging in treatment and from fully benefiting from existing therapies. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a practical augmentation intervention aimed at ameliorating this impairing cognitive style prior to disorder-specific therapy.Objective:To compare the effectiveness of CRT and a control treatment that was not aimed at enhancing flexibility, named specialized attention therapy (SAT), as add-ons to treatment as usual (TAU).Methods:In a randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial, 71 adult patients with OCD and 61 with AN were randomized to ten twice-weekly sessions with either CRT or SAT, followed by TAU. Patients were evaluated at baseline, post-CRT/SAT, and after 6 and 12 months, with outcomes being quantified using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for OCD and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire for AN.Results:Across study groups, most importantly CRT+TAU was not superior to control treatment (SAT)+TAU in reducing OCD and AN pathology. Contrary to expectations, SAT+TAU may have been more effective than CRT+TAU in patients being treated for OCD.Conclusions:CRT did not enhance the effect of TAU for OCD and AN more than SAT. Unexpectedly, SAT, the control condition, may have had an augmentation effect on TAU in OCD patients. Although this latter finding may have been due to chance, the effect of SAT delivered as a pretreatment add-on intervention for adults with OCD and AN merits future efforts at replication.

A novel virtual reality and motion-assisted exposure therapy, called 3MDR, provides treatment in an immersive, personalized and activating context.Objective:To study the efficacy of 3MDR for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD.Method:In a randomized controlled trial (n= 43) 3MDR was compared to a non-specific treatment component control group. Primary outcome was clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at baseline, after 3MDR, and at the 12-week and 16-week follow-up (primary end point). Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance and mixed models were applied to study differences between groups at the end point and over the course of intervention, controlling for baseline scores.Results:The decrease in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end point was significantly greater for 3MDR as compared to the control group, with a large effect size (F[1, 37] = 6.43,p= 0.016,d= 0.83). No significant between-group difference was detected in the course of PTSD symptoms during treatment when including all time points. The dropout rate was low (7%), and 45% of the patients in the 3MDR group improved clinically. The number needed to treat was 2.86.Conclusions:In this trial, 3MDR significantly decreased PTSD symptoms in veterans with, on average, a history of 4 unsuccessful treatments. The low dropout rate may be indicative of high engagement. However, a lack of significant differences on secondary outcomes limits conclusions that can be drawn on its efficacy and underlines the need for larger phase III trials. These data show emerging evidence for 3MDR and its potential to progress PTSD treatment for veterans (Dutch Trial Register Identifier: NL5126).

Sensory Processing Difficulties in Functional Neurological Disorder: A Possible Predisposing Vulnerability?								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	4			343	352					JUL-AUG 2020	2020	Background: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric condition characterized by sensorimotor difficulties. Patients with FND at times report that sensory experiences trigger and/or exacerbate their symptoms. Sensory processing difficulties are also commonly reported in other psychiatric disorders frequently comorbid in FND, suggesting that contextualizing sensory profiles in FND within a biopsychosocial model may be clinically relevant. Objective: To address this literature gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine sensory processing patterns and their relationship to other neuropsychiatric characteristics in patients with FND. Methods: A retrospective chart review design was used to investigate sensory processing patterns, established with the AdolescentlAdult Sensory Profile self-report questionnaire, in 44 patients with FND. Univariate analyses of cross-sectional screening tests followed by multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify clinical factors associated with sensory processing scores in the FND cohort. Results: Compared to normative data, most patients with FND reported sensory processing tendencies toward low registration, sensory sensitivity, and sensation avoiding. In multivariate regression analyses, the presence of a lifetime anxiety disorder independently predicted elevated low registration scores, while female gender and number of current medications independently predicted increased sensory sensitivity scores. In uncorrected univariate analyses only, individuals with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures were more likely to report increased sensory sensitivity and elevated low registration. Conclusion: These preliminary findings support sensory processing difficulties in some patients with FND. Prospective and large sample size studies are needed to investigate relationships between sensory processing profiles and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, FND sub-types, and treatment outcomes.

Although the underlying mechanism is far from being understood, several interventions have been suggested. However, patients with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and epilepsy are excluded from most intervention studies. Objective: To To present a within-group posttreatment vs pretreatment study representing the retrospective clinical results of an integrative psychotherapy model. Methods: We present the clinical results of 22 patients with PNES diagnosed in an epilepsy center and treated in our neuropsychiatry clinic using an integrative rehabilitative psychotherapy. Therapy included presenting the diagnosis, psychoeducation, seizure reduction behavioral techniques, and coping with past and present stressors. Insomuch as integrative biopsychosocial psychotherapy is based on an individualized treatment protocol for each patient, treatment was individualized and case specific. Results: By the end of treatment, 36% of patients had become seizure free and a further 54% achieved a major seizure reduction (reduction of more than 70%). Seventy-two percent of patients kept at least 70% seizure reduction at follow-up. Global Assessment of Functioning scores improved from a mean of 43.09 to a mean of 72.81 at the end of treatment and 69.72 at follow-up. In addition, we present 3 case descriptions that emphasize the individualized nature of psychotherapeutic decisions. Conclusions: Our results support the feasibility and effectiveness of biopsychosocial based integrative psychotherapy for PNES and set principles for future treatment and prospective clinical trials in the field of individualized psychotherapy.

Examining Disparities in Excessive Alcohol Use Among Black and Hispanic Lesbian and Bisexual Women in the United States: An Intersectional Analysis								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			462	470					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: Sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, bisexual) women and racial-ethnic minority groups in the United States are disproportionately harmed by excessive alcohol use. This study examined disparities in excessive alcohol use at the intersection of race-ethnicity and sexual identity for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic sexual minority women. Method: Using data from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we compared the age-adjusted prevalence of binge drinking and heavy alcohol use among sexual minority women of color, sexual minority White women, and heterosexual women of color with that of White heterosexual women. The joint disparity is the difference in the prevalence of excessive alcohol use between sexual minority women of color and White heterosexual women. The excess intersectional disparity is the portion of the joint disparity that is due to being both a racial-ethnic minority and a sexual minority woman. Results: Black and Hispanic sexual minority women reported the highest prevalence of binge drinking (45.4% and 43.4%, respectively), followed by White sexual minority women (35.7%) and White heterosexual women (23%). Black and Hispanic heterosexual women reported the lowest prevalence of binge drinking (20.8% and 20.2%, respectively). The joint disparity in binge drinking between Black sexual minority women and White heterosexual women was 21.2%, and the excess intersectional disparity was 17.7%. The joint disparity in binge drinking between Hispanic sexual minority women and White heterosexual women was 16.8%, and the excess intersectional disparity was 10.8%. Conclusions: Disparities in excessive alcohol consumption for Black and Hispanic sexual minority women, compared with White heterosexual women, were larger than what would be expected when considering differences by race or sexual identity individually.

Searching for Personalized Medicine for Binge Drinking Smokers: Smoking Cessation Using Varenicline, Nicotine Patch, or Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			426	435					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: Heavy drinking is common among smokers and is associated with especially poor health outcomes. Varenicline may affect mechanisms and clinical outcomes that are relevant for both smoking cessation and alcohol use. The current study examines whether varenicline, relative to nicotine replacement therapy, yields better smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinking smokers. Method: Secondary data analyses of a comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial of three smoking cessation pharmacotherapies (12 weeks of varenicline, nicotine patch, or nicotine patch and lozenge) paired with six counseling sessions were conducted. Adult daily cigarette smokers (N = 1,078, 52% female) reported patterns of alcohol use, cigarette craving, and alcohol-related cigarette craving at baseline and over 4 weeks after quitting. Smoking cessation outcome was 7-day biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Results: Binge drinkers had higher relapse rates than moderate drinkers at 4-week post-target quit day but not at the end of treatment or long-term follow up (12 and 26 weeks). Varenicline did not yield superior smoking cessation outcomes among binge drinkers, nor did it affect alcohol use early in the quit attempt. Varenicline did produce relatively large reductions in alcohol-related cigarette craving and overall cigarette craving during the first 4 weeks after quitting. Conclusions: Varenicline did not yield higher smoking abstinence rates or reduce alcohol use among binge drinkers. Varenicline did reduce alcohol-related cigarette craving but this did not translate to meaningful differences in smoking abstinence. Varenicline's effects on smoking abstinence do not appear to vary significantly as a function of drinking status.

Patient Characteristics at the Takiwasi Addiction Treatment Center								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			416	425					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: Complementary medicines are an emergent field in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) and include Amazonian medicines, such as ayahuasca. The aim of this multimodal cross-sectional study was to investigate characteristics of people who seek treatment for SUDs at an accredited healthcare facility that applies Amazonian medicines along with conventional psychotherapy. Method: We collected clinical and sociodemographic data of consecutive admissions at the Takiwasi Addiction Treatment Center (Tarapoto, Peru) using structured questionnaires, interviews, and letters submitted upon program application describing motivation for treatment. Results: The sample of 50 male participants admitted between 2014 and 2016 was culturally heterogeneous, including patients from Peru (42%), other Latin American countries (34%), and North America/Europe (24%). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria indicated dependencies on cannabis (72%), alcohol (52%), cocaine/base paste (48%), and others; multiple substance use was common (84%). Self-reported depression and anxiety scores showed moderate elevation. Comparison of Addiction Severity Index composite scores to a large U.S. sample suggested somewhat more severe problems in the drug and psychiatric domains. Common motives for selecting the program included interest in Amazonian medicine, the Takiwasi concept of treatment, and unfavorable experiences with past treatments. Being motivated by family, a desire for self-transformation, and spiritual/existential motives were common themes for treatment initiation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the Amazonian medicine-based therapy attracts a diverse patient group not limited to regional residents and may be particularly appealing to more impaired SUD patients with a history of unsuccessful treatment. The sample's cultural diversity suggests an existing interest in such therapies among international SUD treatment-seeking patients. These findings are relevant in light of the need for improved SUD therapies and contribute to the emergent research literature on ayahuasca-based treatments.

Method: A panel study using California hospital discharge data was conducted to assess the relationship between density of medical marijuana dispensaries and opioid poisonings and use disorder. There were 8,536 space-time units at the ZIP code level. Outcome measures included ZIP code counts of opioid poisonings and opioid use disorder; independent variables were local- and adjacent-area medical marijuana dispensaries and demographic and economic characteristics. Results: Independent of effects for covariates, densities of medical marijuana dispensaries were positively related to opioid use disorder (RR = 1.05, CI [1.03, 1.06]) and opioid poisonings (RR = 1.04, CI [1.02, 1.05]) in local areas, but negatively related to opioid misuse in spatially adjacent areas (RR = 0.91, CI [0.88, 0.94] for opioid use disorder, RR = 0.89, CI [0.86, 0.93] for opioid poisonings). Conclusions: Although state-level studies suggest that more liberal marijuana policies may result in fewer opioid overdose deaths, our results within one state suggest that local availability of medical marijuana may not reduce those deaths. The relationship appears to be more complex, possibly based on socioeconomic conditions within and adjacent to areas with higher densities of medical marijuana dispensaries.

Remission From Unhealthy Drinking Among Patients With an Alcohol Use Disorder: A Longitudinal Study Using Systematic, Primary Care-Based Alcohol Screening Data								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			436	445					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: Using electronic health record (EHR) data from a systematic, primary care-based alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) initiative within a health system, we examined correlates of remission from unhealthy drinking among patients with an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Method: We conducted a longitudinal study of 4,078 adults with AUD who screened positive for unhealthy drinking between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2016. We extracted EHR data up to 3 years after screening until October 1, 2018. We used survival analysis to examine associations between remission (i.e., reporting abstinence or low-risk drinking at a subsequent screening) and patient characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment utilization. Results: The median time to remission from unhealthy drinking was 1.7 years. Factors significantly associated with greater odds of remitting from unhealthy drinking during follow-up were female gender; older age (50-64 years); Black or Latino/Hispanic race/ethnicity; having more medical comorbidities; not having a comorbid drug use disorder; lower alcohol consumption levels; and receiving addiction medicine treatment before the index screening. In the first follow-up year, individuals with mental health comorbidities were more likely to remit, but those in psychiatric treatment were less likely. Receiving addiction treatment during follow-up was not associated with remission. Conclusions: Ethnic minorities and individuals with mental illness were more likely to remit, which is encouraging given the health disparities observed among these clinically important subgroups and warrants further research. Our findings may inform research onAUD recovery and clinical practice, as remission from unhealthy drinking is a crucial component of the early stages of recovery.

This study evaluated potential associations of SUD with morbidity and mortality in a large sample of hypertensive patients. Method: Analysis of a limited data set was obtained through IBM Watson Health Explorys, a platform integrating data from electronic health records. Matched controls were defined for each of five SUDs: tobacco use disorder (TUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), cocaine use disorder (COUD), opioid use disorder (OUD), and cannabis use disorder (CUD) using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers. All patients were from The MetroHealth System (Cleveland, OH) and had diagnosed hypertension. SUD group participants had diagnosed abuse/dependence for the substance of interest. Controls for each SUD group had no diagnosis code related to the substance of interest and were selected to match the SUD patients on several factors. Total sample sizes for each SUD-control comparison ranged from 3,176 (CUD) to 49,696 (TUD); proportions of female patients ranged from 31.7% (AUD) to 51.2% (TUD). Outcomes were diagnosis (yes/no) of the following: cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. Results: Logistic regressions revealed that SUD was significantly associated with cerebrovascular accident (odds ratios [ORs]: TUD = 2.23; AUD = 1.68; COUD = 2.53; OUD = 1.87; CUD = 2.20), renal failure (ORs: TUD = 1.46; COUD = 2.09; OUD = 1.77), myocardial infarction (ORs: TUD = 2.96; AUD = 1.92; COUD = 3.00), and mortality (ORs: TUD = 1.34; AUD = 1.60; COUD = 1.83; OUD = 1.35; CUD = 1.39). Conclusions: Among patients with hypertension, those with SUDs appear to have significantly greater risk for morbidity and mortality, suggesting the importance of managing SUD in hypertensive patients.

We examined whether background color modulates people's perception of audiovisual simultaneity. Two hypotheses were proposed and examined: (1) the red-impairment hypothesis: visual processing speed deteriorates when viewing a red background because the magnocellular system is inhibited by red light; and (2) the blue-enhancement hypothesis: the detection of both visual and auditory signals is enhanced when viewing a blue background because it stimulates the blue-light sensitive intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which trigger a higher alert state. Participants were exposed to different backgrounds while performing an audiovisual simultaneity judgment (SJ) task: a flash and a beep were presented at pre-designated stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) and participants judged whether or not the two stimuli were presented simultaneously. Experiment 1 demonstrated a shift of the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) toward the visual-leading condition in the red compared to the blue background when the flash was presented in the periphery. In Experiment 2, the stimulation of ipRGCs was specifically manipulated to test the blue-enhancement hypothesis. The results showed no support for this hypothesis, perhaps due to top-down cortical modulations. Taken together, the shift of PSS toward the visual-leading condition in the red background was attributed to impaired visual processing speed with respect to auditory processing speed, caused by the inhibition of the magnocellular system under red light.

Effects of Alcohol, Condom Request Style, and State Anger on Men's Condom Use Resistance								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			454	461					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the distal predictors (alcohol expectancies, adversarial heterosexual beliefs) and proximal predictors (alcohol intoxication, partner's condom use request style, state anger) of young men's condom use resistance (CUR). Method: Young, male, non-problem drinking, inconsistent condom users (N = 297) completed an alcohol administration experiment. After completing background measures, participants were randomly assigned to receive a control or alcoholic beverage (target peak breath alcohol concentration =.08%). They then read a randomly assigned hypothetical sexual scenario in which their female partner requested to use a condom either indirectly, directly, or insistently. Participants' desire to have condomless sex, state anger, and both coercive and noncoercive CUR intentions were assessed. Results: Path analyses demonstrated that alcohol intoxication directly predicted noncoercive CUR intentions. In addition, a moderated mediation pathway was found such that, relative to sober participants, intoxicated men's sexual aggression-related alcohol expectancies were positively associated with their state anger in response to the partner's condom use request. This increased anger was related to stronger noncoercive CUR intentions. Adversarial heterosexual beliefs both directly and indirectly predicted coercive and noncoercive CUR intentions. Conclusions: Path analysis demonstrated that alcohol intoxication increased intentions to resist condom use through noncoercive tactics. In addition, men's misogynistic attitudes and alcohol intoxication were associated with greater feelings of anger, which predicted stronger coercive and noncoercive CUR intentions.

MDD and BD were compared regarding their symptom profiles and time to response and remission. Furthermore, the concordance between the MINI-Plus and clinical diagnosis was analyzed.Results:Patients were on average 52 and 47 years old in the MDD and BD group, respectively, and 66 versus 64% were female. Compared to patients with BD, patients with MDD scored higher on weight loss (p= 0.02), whereas the BD group showed a higher long-term likelihood of response (hazard ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.20,pfor interaction with time = 0.04). Although the same association was seen for remission, the interaction with time was not significant (p= 0.48). Efficiency between the MINI-Plus and clinical diagnosis of BD was high (0.90), suggesting that the MINI-Plus is an adequate ROM diagnostic tool.Conclusions:In routine clinical inpatient care, minor differences in the symptom profile and the course of depressive symptomatology may be helpful in distinguishing MDD and BD, particularly when using sequential ROM assessments.

There is also evidence for many of the same motor abnormalities in biological first-degree relatives and accruing evidence for motor abnormalities in bipolar disorder. In addition to motor dysfunction, there are also shared symptom domains amongst these populations.Objectives:We explored the associations of (1) current and lifetime psychosis and mood symptom domains and (2) domains of psychosis proneness with various domains of motor function in a transdiagnostic sample (n= 149).Method:Individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, biological first-degree relatives of individuals with a psychotic disorder, and controls completed measures of psychomotor speed and movement fluidity, and neural activity related to motor preparation (stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential, S-LRP) and execution (response-locked LRP) was assessed using EEG. All participants completed the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; patients were additionally assessed for lifetime psychosis and mood episode symptoms, and relatives and controls completed the Chapman psychosis proneness scales.Results:Multiple regression revealed levels of current negative symptoms and mania were significantly positively associated with psychomotor slowing even after accounting for current antipsychotic medication dosage and duration of illness. S-LRP onset latency was significantly positively associated with magical ideation.Conclusion:Domains of motor function are associated with various mood and psychosis symptom domains in a transdiagnostic sample, which may provide insight into brain abnormalities relevant to the expression of symptoms across disorders.

Despite their clinical relevance, the neural correlates underlying such phenomena are unclear. Recent research suggests that specific delusional content may be associated with distinct neural substrates.Objective:Here, we used structural magnetic resonance imaging to investigate multiple parameters of brain morphology in patients presenting with paranoid type delusional disorder (pt-DD,n= 14) compared to those of healthy controls (HC,n= 25).Methods:Voxel- and surface-based morphometry for structural data was used to investigate gray matter volume (GMV), cortical thickness (CT) and gyrification.Results:Compared to HC, patients with pt-DD showed reduced GMV in bilateral amygdala and right inferior frontal gyrus. Higher GMV in patients was found in bilateral orbitofrontal and in left superior frontal cortices. Patients also had lower CT in frontal and temporal regions. Abnormal gyrification in patients was evident in frontal and temporal areas, as well as in bilateral insula.Conclusions:The data suggest the presence of aberrant GMV in a right prefrontal region associated with belief evaluation, as well as distinct structural abnormalities in areas that essentially subserve processing of fear, anxiety and threat in patients with pt-DD. It is possible that cortical features of distinct evolutionary and genetic origin, i.e. CT and gyrification, contribute differently to the pathogenesis of pt-DD.

Local features and global shape information in object classification by deep convolutional neural networks								VISION RESEARCH				172				46	61		10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.003			JUL 2020	2020	Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) show impressive similarities to the human visual system. Recent research, however, suggests that DCNNs have limitations in recognizing objects by their shape. We tested the hypothesis that DCNNs are sensitive to an object's local contour features but have no access to global shape information that predominates human object recognition. We employed transfer learning to assess local and global shape processing in trained networks. In Experiment 1, we used restricted and unrestricted transfer learning to retrain AlexNet, VGG-19, and ResNet-50 to classify circles and squares. We then probed these networks with stimuli with conflicting global shape and local contour information. We presented networks with overall square shapes comprised of curved elements and circles comprised of corner elements. Networks classified the test stimuli by local contour features rather than global shapes. In Experiment 2, we changed the training data to include circles and squares comprised of different elements so that the local contour features of the object were uninformative. This considerably increased the network's tendency to produce global shape responses, but deeper analyses in Experiment 3 revealed the network still showed no sensitivity to the spatial configuration of local elements. These findings demonstrate that DCNNs' performance is an inversion of human performance with respect to global and local shape processing. Whereas abstract relations of elements predominate in human perception of shape, DCNNs appear to extract only local contour fragments, with no representation of how they spatially relate to each other to form global shapes.

Nonmedical Use of Prescription Opioids, Heroin Use, Injection Drug Use, and Overdose Mortality in US Adolescents								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			484	488					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: We assessed overdose mortality by opioid types involved as well as interrelationships between nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NUPO) and heroin and injection drug use (IDU) among adolescents. Method: We examined 2010 and 2016 overdose data by drug type for decedents in the United States ages 15-19 years from the Multiple Cause of Death Files. We also analyzed data from the 2017 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative survey of high school students. We assessed lifetime NUPO and calculated heroin use and IDU by frequency of lifetime NUPO. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were generated, and linear contrast analysis determined dose-response relationships between frequency of lifetime NUPO and the two outcomes. Results: The percentage of deaths involving prescription opioids that also involved illicit opioids such as heroin or fentanyl was 5.5% in 2010 and 25.0% in 2016. We observed a positive dose-response relationship with frequency of lifetime NUPO; aPRs were highest for 20 or more times of NUPO and heroin use (aPR = 49.49, 95% CI [33.39, 73.34]) and IDU (aPR = 44.37, 95% CI [23.16, 84.99]). However, aPRs for heroin and IDU were high even among those reporting just one or two occasions of NUPO (aPRs = 9.25, 95% CI [5.90, 14.49] and 6.63, 95% CI [3.99, 11.02], respectively). Conclusions: Adolescent prescription opioid overdose deaths now frequently involve illicit opioids. Heroin use and IDU are higher among students reporting even a few instances of NUPO, indicating that students with any NUPO are an important risk group. Clinical, community, and school-based efforts can address NUPO, noting these associations.

Horror, Personality, and Threat Simulation: A Survey on the Psychology of Scary Media								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	3			213	230		10.1037/ebs0000152			JUL 2020	2020	Horror entertainment is a thriving and paradoxical industry. Who are the consumers of horror, and why do they seek out frightening media? We provide support for the threat simulation theory of horror, according to which horror media provides a form of benign masochism that offers negative emotional stimulation through simulation of threat scenarios. Through an online survey of genre use and preference as well as personality traits and paranormal beliefs (n = 1.070), we find that sensation seeking and the fifth of the Big Five factors, intellect/imagination, predict liking of horror and frequency of use. Gender, educational level, and age are also correlated with horror liking and frequency of use (males show higher liking and more frequent use, whereas liking and use frequency are negatively correlated with educational level and age). People with stronger beliefs in the paranormal tend to seek out horror media with supernatural content, whereas those with weaker beliefs in the paranormal gravitate toward horror media with natural content, suggesting that people seek out horror media with threatening stimuli that they perceive to be plausible. While frightening media may be initially aversive, people high in sensation seeking and intellect/imagination, in particular. like intellectual stimulation and challenge and expect not just negative but also positive emotions from horror consumption. They brave the initially aversive response to simulate threats and so enter a positive feedback loop by which they attain adaptive mastery through coping with virtual simulated danger.

JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			511	519					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: Studies of clinical and high-risk samples have demonstrated associations between parental alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and offspring's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems during adolescence and early adulthood. It remains unclear, however, whether associations between parental AUD histories and offspring behavior problems are evident among very young offspring who were not directly exposed to a parent who experienced an activeAUD episode during the child's lifetime. The present study sought to evaluate internalizing and externalizing behavior problems among young children as a function of paternal and maternal AUD histories and associated clinical features. Method: The community sample consisted of 160 families with a 2-year-old child and parents who did not experience an AUD episode since the child was born. Parental AUD histories and associated clinical features were evaluated with semistructured interviews, and parental reports of child internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed with an age-appropriate behavior checklist. Results: In contrast to previous findings from clinical and high-risk samples, when paternal and maternal AUD histories and associated clinical features were evaluated as predictors of child behavior problems, no statistically significant associations were detected (beta s ranged from .01 to .18). Moderating effects of sex of the offspring were also not significant. Conclusions: Parental AUD histories do not appear to confer risk for offspring internalizing or externalizing behavior problems at age 2. The emergence of such behavior problems may be limited to specific developmental periods during childhood or reflect the impact of direct exposure to parents with alcohol-related problems.

Two binocular cues have been investigated for motion in depth: inter-ocular velocity difference (IOVD) and changing disparity (CD). IOVD provides direction information directly by comparing velocity signals from the two retinas. In this study, we propose for the first time a motion-in-depth model of IOVD that predicts motion-in-depth direction. The model is based on a psychophysical assumption that there are four channels tuned to different directions in depth (Journal of Physiology 235 (1973) 17-29). We modeled these channels by combining outputs of low-level motion detectors that are sensitive to left and right retinal stimulation. Using these channels, we constructed a model of motion in depth that successfully predicted a variety of psychophysical results including direction discrimination, perceived direction, spatial frequency tuning, effect of speed on rotation in depth, effect of lateral motion direction, and effect of binocular and temporal correlations.

A Comparison of Youth E-Cigarette Use and Cigarette Smoking in the MTF and PATH Surveys								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			497	504					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: We compared estimates of adolescents' nicotine product use and perceptions of harm from two national surveys: Monitoring the Future (MTF) and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH). We explored one explanation for the different estimates for nicotine product use and adolescents' perceptions of harm. Method: We used data source triangulation examining 30-day e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking, beliefs about harm, and friends' use of these products in two samples of adolescents from the 2015-2016 MTF and PATH samples. Results: Differences were found, with MTF reporting higher prevalence rates in both past-30-day e-cigarette use (12.4% vs. 6.7%) and cigarette smoking (8.6% vs. 5.1%) when compared with PATH. Differences were significant at the .001 alpha level. MTF respondents were less likely than PATH respondents to view both e-cigarettes (17.7% vs. 48.6%) and cigarettes (75.6% vs. 82.4%) as harmful. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) shows that PATH respondents had significantly lower odds of indicating either e-cigarette (OR = 0.509, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.400, 0.648]) or cigarette smoking (OR = 0.571, 95% CI [0.433, 0.753]) when compared with MTF respondents. However, these differences in e-cigarette use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.849, 95% CI [0.630, 1.144]) and cigarette smoking (AOR = 0.829, 95% CI = [0.578, 1.189]) were mediated when additional predictors were included in the model (i.e., friends use, risk of harm). Conclusions: Substantial differences were found between national surveys estimating population rates of e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking. Data source triangulation allowed for new explanations for several of the disparate nicotine use estimates between MTF and PATH.

While it can fit any disorder diagnosis of the schizoaffective spectrum, its core features consist of a mix of hypo- and hyperkinesias resulting in distortions of expressive movements such as grimacing and parakinesias. The replication of cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases in the left supplementary motor area (L-SMA) and lateral premotor cortex (L-LPM) in acute and remitting PC patients indicates that these increases could be used as diagnostic biomarkers. In this proof-of-concept study, 2 different MRI sequences were repeated on 3 separate days to get reliable measurement values of CBF in 9 PC and 26 non-PC patients during different cognitive tasks. Each patient was compared to 37 controls. In L-SMA [-9; +10; +60] and L-LPM [-46; -12; +43], a test was positive if thetvalue was >2.02 (alpha < 0.05; two tailed). The measurements had good analytical performance. Regarding the tests, their sensitivities and specificities were significantly different from the chance level on both measures, except for L-SMA sensitivities. When combining all the tests, among regions and methods, sensitivity was 98% (95% credible interval [CI] 76-100%) and specificity 88% (72-97%). Bayesian inferences of its negative predictive values for PC were >95% regardless of the context, while its positive predictive values reached 94% but only when used in combination with clinical criteria. The case-by-case analysis suggests that non-PC patients with neurological motor deficits are at risk to be false positive.

Adolescents (N = 396; M-age = 14.64, SDage = 1.52: 58% girls) completed self-report measures on bullying perpetration and victimization, prosocial strategies. dominance, and alliance formation. As predicted. path analyses revealed that bullying perpetration was positively associated with dominance only, whereas prosocial strategies were positively associated with both dominance and alliance formation. As expected, victimization was negatively associated with alliance formation, but the hypothesized negative relation with dominance was not found. Finally, prosocial behavior did not interact with bullying perpetration or victimization, contrary to predictions. Overall, results were consistent with resource control theory in that coercive (i.e., bullying) and prosocial strategies were both associated with at least one measure of the ability to acquire resources. However, findings were also in accord with reciprocal altruism, social contract theory, and indirect reciprocity theory, as participants' prosocial behavior was the only strategy associated with self-reports of peers cooperating with participants in alliances.

Time-resolved correspondences between deep neural network layers and EEG measurements in object processing								VISION RESEARCH				172				27	45		10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.005			JUL 2020	2020	The ventral visual stream is known to be organized hierarchically, where early visual areas processing simplistic features feed into higher visual areas processing more complex features. Hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were largely inspired by this type of brain organization and have been successfully used to model neural responses in different areas of the visual system. In this work, we aim to understand how an instance of these models corresponds to temporal dynamics of human object processing. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and various similarity metrics, we compare the model representations with two electroencephalography (EEG) data sets containing responses to a shared set of 72 images. We find that there is a hierarchical relationship between the depth of a layer and the time at which peak correlation with the brain response occurs for certain similarity metrics in both data sets. However, when comparing across layers in the neural network, the correlation onset time did not appear in a strictly hierarchical fashion. We present two additional methods that improve upon the achieved correlations by optimally weighting features from the CNN and show that depending on the similarity metric, deeper layers of the CNN provide a better correspondence than shallow layers to later time points in the EEG responses. However, we do not find that shallow layers provide better correspondences than those of deeper layers to early time points, an observation that violates the hierarchy and is in agreement with the finding from the onset-time analysis. This work makes a first comparison of various response features-including multiple similarity metrics and data sets-with respect to a neural network.		[Kong, Nathan C. L.; Yamins, Daniel L.

Postural Control and Verbal and Visual Working Memory Correlates in Nonclinical Psychosis								NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY				79	4-5			293	300		10.1159/000498921			JUL 2020	2020	Introduction:Motor and cognitive abnormalities are well documented in psychosis spectrum disorders. Evidence suggests these deficits could be pronounced because of disruptions in the cerebellar-thalamic-cortical-cerebellar (CTCC) circuit, a network thought to be heavily implicated in motor and higher cognitive functioning. Although significant research has been done on this topic in individuals with schizophrenia and those at a clinical high risk for psychosis, much less is known about deficits at the lower end of the spectrum.Methods:In this study, we extended the understanding of motor abnormalities across the psychosis continuum by examining postural sway deficits in the nonclinical psychosis (NCP) population. Furthermore, we linked these deficits to verbal and visual working memory. High-NCP (n= 37) and low-NCP control (n= 31) participants completed an instrumental balance task, highly sensitive to subtle variations in postural sway, along with a brief working memory battery.Results:We found that high-NCP participants presented with increased postural sway area (i.e., worse postural control) relative to low-NCP controls on a difficult condition (with limited proprioceptive cues), but not on an easier condition. Furthermore, results indicated that the sway area was correlated with poorer performance on working memory tasks in the high-NCP group.Conclusion:These findings suggest that CTCC circuit abnormalities are present across the lower end of the psychosis spectrum and that they may be contributing to a range of motor and cognitive behaviors seen in the population. However, evidence suggests that the signs are subtle, and that sensitive assessment devices and challenging conditions may be necessary for detection.		[Ristanovic, Ivanka; Osborne, K.

This study sought to explore accuracy of gait-related features measured by smartphone accelerometer sensors on detecting alcohol intoxication (breath alcohol concentration [BrAC] >.08%). Method: In a controlled laboratory study, participants (N = 17; 12 male) were asked to walk 10 steps in a straight line, turn, and walk 10 steps back before drinking and each hour, for up to 7 hours after drinking a weight-based dose of alcohol to reach a BrAC of.20%. Smartphones were placed on the lumbar region and 3-axis accelerometer data was recorded at a rate of 100 Hz. Accelerometer data were segmented into task segments (i.e., walk forward, walk backward). Features were generated for each overlapping 1-second windows, and the data set was split into training and testing data sets. Logistic regression models were used to estimate accuracy for classifying BrAC = .08% from BrAC > .08% for each subject. Results: Across participants, BrAC > .08% was predicted with a mean accuracy of 92.5% using logistic regression, an improvement from a naive model accuracy of 88.2% (mean sensitivity = .89; specificity = .92; positive predictive value = .77; and negative predictive value = .97). The two most informative accelerometer features were mean signal amplitude and variance of the signal in the x-axis (i.e., gait sway). Conclusions: We found preliminary evidence supporting use of gait-related features measured by smartphone accelerometer sensors to detect alcohol intoxication. Future research should determine whether these findings replicate situ.

"Good genes" and dominance cues are perceived as attractive when considering short-term relationships. In contrast, cues for better parenting abilities and trustworthiness are considered more attractive when participants ponder a long-term relationship. We investigated women's and men's attractiveness preferences in other-sex faces that were structurally altered along a continuum of apparent trustworthiness. Faces were adjusted in shape toward the perceived trustworthy-untrustworthy extremes defined on the basis of previously created prototypes. We anticipated that perceived trustworthiness would be more important for long-term than short-term relationships because of the greater costs of exploitation. Also, we explored individual differences in preferences, anticipating that participants with high social interaction anxiety would prefer more trustworthy-looking faces. As expected, we found a preference for more trustworthy-looking faces when participants considered a long-term versus a short-term relationship. Social interaction anxiety correlated positively with trustworthiness preferences, probably reflecting an avoidance response in anxious individuals, induced by untrustworthy cues. Collectively, these findings constitute novel evidence of the influence of individual differences in mate choice-relevant face preferences.

This results in a high percentage of misdiagnosis and consequential inefficient treatment; especially regarding major depressive disorder (MDD), depression in the context of bipolar disorder (BD-D), bipolar disorder with manic symptoms (BD-M), and psychosis in the context of schizophrenia (SZ). Objective biomarkers allowing for accurate discriminatory diagnostics are therefore urgently needed.Methods:Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteomes of patients with MDD (n= 5) , BD-D (n= 3), BD-M (n= 4), and SZ (n= 4), and also of healthy controls (HC;n= 6) were analyzed by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. Proteins with a differential expression of a >2 standard deviation (SD) expression fold change from that of the HC and between either MDD versus BD-D or BD-M versus SZ were subsequently identified as potential discriminatory biomarkers.Results:In total, 4,271 individual proteins were retrieved from the HC. Of these, about 2,800 were detected in all patient and HC samples. For objective discrimination between MDD and BD-D, 66 candidate biomarkers were found. In parallel, 72 proteins might harbor a biomarker capacity for differential diagnostics of BD-M and SZ. A single biomarker was contraregulated versus HC in each pair of comparisons.Discussion:With this work, we provide a register of candidate biomarkers with the potential to objectively discriminate MDD from BD-D, and BD-M from SZ. Although concerning a proof-of-concept study with limited sample size, these data provide a stepping-stone for follow-up research on the validation of the true discriminatory potential and feasibility of clinical implementation of the discovered biomarker candidates.

J	Konishi, Naoki; Himichi, Toshiyuki; Ohtsubo, Yohsuke								Heart Rate Reveals the Difference Between Disgust and Anger in the Domain of Morality								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	3			284	298		10.1037/ebs0000179			JUL 2020	2020	People often experience anger and/or disgust when observing wrongdoings. It is considered that anger and disgust elicited by moral violations are associated with different social functions: Anger motivates direct punishment and disgust motivates indirect punishment. However, within the domain of morality, some scholars question the distinctness of anger and disgust and doubt the relevance of disgust to moral judgments. By reanalyzing data from a previous study, we first confirmed that self-reported disgust (independently of anger) is associated with moral judgments (Pilot Study 1). Subsequently. we investigated the potential of distinguishing disgust from anger by changes in heart rate (HR) in the domain of morality. We measured participants' HR while they read a series of moral violation scenarios. The results of three studies (Pilot Study 2, Study 1, and Study 2) demonstrated an association between decreased HR and disgust in response to moral violations. Anger tended to be associated with increased HR, but this association occasionally failed to reach statistical significance. Study 2 also revealed that anger provoked both direct and indirect punishment, whereas disgust provoked indirect punishment and distancing from the transgressor.

Cognitive Functioning Related to Binge Alcohol and Cannabis Co-Use in Abstinent Adolescents and Young Adults								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			479	483					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: Despite preliminary evidence of unique acute cognitive and psychopharmacological changes attributable to combined alcohol and cannabis use, few studies have investigated more chronic effects of same-day co-use, particularly during neurodevelopmentally sensitive periods. Therefore, relationships between past-month binge alcohol and cannabis co-use and cognitive functioning were examined in adolescents and young adults. Method: Data from the Imaging Data in Emerging Adults with Addiction (IDEAA) Consortium were used to assess cognitive functioning in emerging adults with a large range of substance use (n = 232; 15-26 years old) who were abstinent for at least 3 weeks. Multiple regressions assessed cognitive functioning by past-month binge episodes, cannabis use episodes, and same-day couse, controlling for covariates (e.g., study site, sex, age). Results: After correcting for multiple comparisons, more past-month co-use episodes were related to decreased Ruff 2&7 selective attention accuracy (p = .036). Sex significantly covaried with California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition initial learning. Conclusions: Although few significant relationships were found and effect sizes are modest, the persistence of an effect on attention despite a period of sustained abstinence highlights the need to carefully investigate patterns of substance use and potential independent and interactive effects on the developing brain.

However, little is known about the functional interplay between distinct intrinsic neural networks and their association with AVH.Methods:We investigated functional network connectivity (FNC) of distinct resting-state networks as well as the relationship between FNC strength and AVH symptom severity. Resting-state functional MRI data at 3 T were obtained for 14 healthy controls and 10 patients with schizophrenia presenting with persistent AVH. The data were analyzed using a spatial group independent component analysis, followed by constrained maximal lag correlations to determine FNC within and between groups.Results:Four components of interest, comprising language, attention, executive control networks, as well as the default-mode network (DMN), were selected for subsequent FNC analyses. Patients with persistent AVH showed lower FNC between the language network and the DMN (p< 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate). FNC strength, however, was not significantly related to symptom severity, as measured by the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale.Conclusion:These findings suggest that disrupted FNC between a speech-related system and a network subserving self-referential processing is associated with AVH. The data are consistent with a model of disrupted self-attribution of speech generation and perception.

Method: Using nationwide data for individuals born in Sweden from 1972 to 1981 (n = 930,182), we conducted instrumental variable and co-relative analyses of the association between academic achievement and AUD with a mean 21.4-year follow-up. Our instrument, used in the instrumental variable analyses, was month of birth. Co-relative analyses were conducted in cousins, full siblings, and monozygotic twins discordant for AUD, with observed results fitted to a genetic model. The academic achievement-AUD association was modeled in Cox regression. AUD was assessed using national medical, criminal, or pharmacy registries. Results: Later month of birth was significantly associated with poorer academic achievement. Lower standardized academic achievement had a strong relationship with the risk for subsequent AUD registration: hazard ratio (HR) [per SD] = 2.14 [2.11, 2.17]. Instrumental variable analysis produced a substantial but moderately attenuated association: HR = 1.52 [1.28, 1.80]. Controlling for modest associations between month of birth and parental education and AUD risk reduced the association to HR = 1.43 [1.20, 1.69]. Our genetic co-relative model fitted the observed data relatively well and estimated the academic achievement-AUD association in monozygotic twins discordant for academic achievement to equal an HR of 1.44 [1.35, 1.52]. Results were broadly similar when analyzed separately in males and females. Conclusions: Two distinct methods with different assumptions produced results suggesting that the association observed between academic achievement at age 16 and the risk for AUD into middle adulthood is partly causal, thereby providing support for interventions to improve academic achievement as a means to prevent later AUD risk.

J	Boness, Cassandra L.; Sher, Kenneth J.								The Case for Cognitive Interviewing in Survey Item Validation: A Useful Approach for Improving the Measurement and Assessment of Substance Use Disorders								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	4			401	404					JUL 2020	2020	Objective: To accurately identify substance use disorders, we must be confident of our ability to define and measure the construct itself. To date, research has demonstrated that the ways in which substance use disorder criteria are operationalized or assessed can significantly affect the information we obtain from these diagnoses. For example, differing operationalizations of the same construct, such as impaired control over substance use, can result in markedly different estimates of prevalence. This points to the need for approaches that aim to improve the validity of diagnostic assessments during the measure development phase. Method: We performed a scoping review of the cognitive interviewing literature, a technique that aims to provide a systematic way of identifying and reducing measurement error associated with the structure and content of assessment items. Along with this, we apply cognitive interviewing to items assessing alcohol tolerance. Results: We argue that cognitive interviewing is well suited for reducing measurement error in substance use disorder assessment items. Conclusions: Incorporating cognitive interviewing into the item generation stage of measure development for substance use disorder assessments is a worthwhile endeavor for improving validity.

J	Case, Trevor, I; Stevenson, Richard J.; Byrne, Richard W.; Hobaiter, Catherine								The Animal Origins of Disgust: Reports of Basic Disgust in Nonhuman Great Apes								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	3			231	260		10.1037/ebs0000175			JUL 2020	2020	Intrinsic to an evolved disease avoidance account of disgust is Darwin's assumption of continuity between the emotional lives of humans and animals. However, beyond the case of avoiding stimuli that taste bad, there has been little exploration of the existence of basic disgust elicitors in animals. Moreover, one influential perspective holds that disgust is unique to humans-a preadaptation of distaste that expands through culture to include a wide range of elicitors (e.g., Rozin. 2015). The present study represents a broad-scope investigation into disgust-like responses that might be present in nonhuman great ape species. A survey of aversions, contamination reactions, and signs of disgust in nonhuman great apes (principally chimpanzees) was collected from 74 great ape researchers. fieldworkers, and keepers. Overall, the results suggest that nonhuman great apes share with humans an aversion to a restricted range of core pathogen sources, which extends beyond distaste to resemble human disgust. However, in nonhuman great apes. this aversion is muted. Candidates for this difference between humans and other great apes are considered. including frequent exposure to basic disgust elicitors in nonhuman great apes and increased dependence on meat-eating in hominin ancestry. We suggest that differences in disgust- like behavior between humans and nonhuman great apes reflect the specific ecological standpoint of the animal and that rather than being unique to humans, disgust is a continuation of the armory of disease avoidance behavior ubiquitous in animals.

Binge Drinking by Occupation Groups among Currently Employed US Adults in 32 States, 2013-2016								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	12			1968	1979		10.1080/10826084.2020.1784947			SEP 1 2020	2020	Background:Excessive alcohol use, including binge drinking (i.e., >= 5 drinks (males); >= 4 drinks (females), per occasion during the past 30 days), is associated with work-related injuries, absenteeism, and lost productivity. Binge drinking varies by sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, income). However, information on binge drinking by occupation is limited.Purpose:This study examined binge drinking prevalence, frequency, intensity, and total binge drinks per binge drinker by sociodemographic characteristics and occupation.Methods:Data were analyzed from 358,355 currently employed U.S. adults who resided in the 32 states that administered the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System industry and occupation questions during 2013-2016. Binge drinking was evaluated using weighted and adjusted prevalence models.Results:Among currently employed adults in the 32 states, 20.8% reported binge drinking, with an average of nearly 49 times per year and an average intensity of 7.4 drinks per binge episode, resulting in 478 total binge drinks per binge drinker. The adjusted binge drinking prevalence ranged from 15.9% among community and social services workers to 26.3% among construction and extraction workers. The total annual binge drinks per binge drinker ranged from 207 drinks among community and social services workers to 749 drinks among construction and extraction workers.Conclusions:One in five employed adults binge drink, and binge drinking varied across occupation groups. Widespread use of effective community-based strategies for preventing excessive alcohol use (e.g., regulating alcohol outlet density), as well as interventions tailored to specific occupation groups, and could reduce binge drinking and improve occupational safety and health.

Further, past research has indicated that individuals with PTSD may demonstrate an increased sensitivity to strain. Despite this, no study has examined the relevance of these processes for understanding binge drinking behaviors from a developmental perspective.Purpose/Objectives: Understand the relevance of PTSD-linked strain sensitivity for predicting binge drinking in adolescence and adulthood.Methods: This study utilizes data from the Pathways to Desistance study, comprising the responses of 1354 juvenile offenders across seven years following an adjudication. A series of ordinal logistic regression models estimated these effects in adolescence and early adulthood.Results: Results indicate that adolescent PTSD interacted with witnessed violence to produce lower frequency binge drinking. This effect was non-significant in early adulthood.Conclusions/Importance: These findings indicate that adolescent PTSD-sufferers demonstrate diminished sensitivity to witnessed violence. This may have to do with adolescence social processes.

J	Brickwedde, Marion; Schmidt, Marie D.; Krueger, Marie C.; Dinse, Hubert R.								20 Hz Steady-State Response in Somatosensory Cortex During Induction of Tactile Perceptual Learning Through LTP-Like Sensory Stimulation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						257	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00257			JUN 30 2020	2020	The induction of synaptic plasticity requires the presence of temporally patterned neural activity. Numerous cellular studies in animals and brain slices have demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) enhances synaptic transmission, which can be evoked by high-frequency intermittent stimulation. In humans, plasticity processes underlying perceptual learning can be reliably induced by repetitive, LTP-like sensory stimulation. These protocols lead to improvement of perceptual abilities parallel to widespread remodeling of cortical processing. However, whether maintained rhythmic cortical activation induced by the LTP-like stimulation is also present during human perceptual learning experiments, remains elusive. To address this question, we here applied a 20 Hz intermittent stimulation protocol for 40 min to the index-, middle- and ring-fingers of the right hand, while continuously recording EEG over the hand representation in primary somatosensory cortex in young adult participants. We find that each train of stimulation initiates a transient series of sensory-evoked potentials which accumulate after about 500 ms into a 20 Hz steady-state response persisting over the entire period of the 2-s-train. During the inter-train interval, no consistent evoked activity can be detected. This response behavior is maintained over the whole 40 min of stimulation without any indication of habituation. However, the early stimulation evoked potentials (SEPs) and the event-related desynchronization (ERD) during the steady-state response change over the 40 min of stimulation. In a second experiment, we demonstrate in a separate cohort of participants that the here-applied pneumatic type of stimulation results in improvement of tactile acuity as typically observed for electrically applied 20 Hz intermittent stimulation. Our data demonstrate that repetitive stimulation using a 20 Hz protocol drives rhythmic activation in the hand representation of somatosensory cortex, which is sustained during the entire stimulation period. At the same time, cortical excitability increases as indicated by altered ERD and SEP amplitudes. Our results, together with previous data underlining the dependence of repetitive sensory stimulation effects on NMDA-receptor activation, support the view that repetitive sensory stimulation elicits LTP-like processes in the cortex, thereby facilitating perceptual learning processes.

Late fMRI Response Components Are Altered in Autism Spectrum Disorder								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						241	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00241			JUN 30 2020	2020	Disrupted cortical neural inhibition has been hypothesized to be a primary contributor to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This hypothesis predicts that ASD will be associated with an increase in neural responses. We tested this prediction by comparing fMRI response magnitudes to simultaneous visual, auditory, and motor stimulation in ASD and neurotypical (NT) individuals. No increases in the initial transient response in any brain region were observed in ASD, suggesting that there is no increase in overall cortical neural excitability. Most notably, there were widespread fMRI magnitude increases in the ASD response following stimulation offset, approximately 6-8 s after the termination of sensory and motor stimulation. In some regions, the higher fMRI offset response in ASD could be attributed to a lack of an "undershoot"-an often observed feature of fMRI responses believed to reflect inhibitory processing. Offset response magnitude was associated with reaction times (RT) in the NT group and may explain an overall reduced RT in the ASD group. Overall, our results suggest that increases in neural responsiveness are present in ASD but are confined to specific components of the neural response, are particularly strong following stimulation offset, and are linked to differences in RT.

However, little is known about whether the patterns of structural connectivity and effective connectivity differ between adults and children during semantic processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to study the developmental differences of brain activation, structural connectivity, and effective connectivity during semantic judgments. Twenty-six children (8- to 12-year-olds) and 26 adults were asked to indicate if character pairs were related in meaning. Compared to children, adults showed greater activation in the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Also, adults had significantly greater structural connectivity in the left ventral pathway (inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, IFOF) than children. Moreover, adults showed significantly stronger bottom-up effects from left fusiform gyrus (FG) to ventral IFG than children in the related condition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that age-related increases in brain activation (ventral IFG and MTG), IFOF, and effective connectivity (from FG to ventral IFG) might be associated with the bottom-up influence of orthographic representations on retrieving semantic representations for processing Chinese characters.

In order to investigate the underlying neurophysiology of MR, hemodynamic responses from the prefrontal cortex of 14 healthy subjects were recorded with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a novel MR task that had three categorical difficulty levels. Hemodynamic activity strength (HAS) parameter, which reflects the ratio of brain activation during the task to the baseline activation level, was used to assess the prefrontal cortex activation localization and strength. Behavioral data indicated that the MR requiring conditions are more difficult than the condition that did not require MR. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was found to be active in all conditions and to be the dominant region in the easiest task while more complex tasks showed widespread bilateral prefrontal activation. A significant increase in left DLPFC activation was observed with increasing task difficulty. Significantly higher right DLPFC activation was observed when the incongruent trials were contrasted against the congruent trials, which implied the possibility of a robust error or conflict-monitoring process during the incongruent trials. Our results showed that the right DLPFC is a core region for the processing of MR tasks regardless of the task complexity and that the left DLPFC is involved to a greater extent with increasing task complexity, which is consistent with the previous neuroimaging literature.

Aerobic Exercise Induces Functional and Structural Reorganization of CNS Networks in Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						255	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00255			JUN 30 2020	2020	Objectives: Evidence from animal studies suggests that aerobic exercise may promote neuroplasticity and could, therefore, provide therapeutic benefits for neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effects of exercise in human CNS disorders on the topology of brain networks, which might serve as an outcome at the interface between biology and clinical performance, remain poorly understood. Methods: We investigated functional and structural networks in patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a clinical trial of standardized aerobic exercise. Fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to moderate-intensity exercise for 3 months or a non-exercise control group. We reconstructed functional networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and used probabilistic tractography on diffusion-weighted imaging data for structural networks. Results: At baseline, compared to 30 healthy controls, patients exhibited decreased structural connectivity that was most pronounced in hub regions of the brain. Vice versa, functional connectivity was increased in hubs. After 3 months, we observed hub independent increased functional connectivity in the exercise group while the control group presented a loss of functional hub connectivity. On a structural level, the control group remained unchanged, while the exercise group had also increased connectivity. Increased clustering of hubs indicates a better structural integration and internal connectivity at the top of the network hierarchy. Conclusion: Increased functional connectivity of hubs contrasts a loss of structural connectivity in relapsing-remitting MS. Under an exercise condition, a further hub independent increase of functional connectivity seems to translate in higher structural connectivity of the whole brain.

There are no studies concerning brain activation of the cortex comparing children with and without AOB during rest and activities such as deglutition and phonation. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of the brain cortex of children with AOB at rest and during phonation and deglutition and to evaluate the association of intelligence quotient (IQ), attention (Test of Variables of Attention, known as TOVA), beats per minute (BPM), and oxygen saturation measurement (SpO(2)) with brain activity in subjects with AOB. Fourteen children (seven with AOB and seven without AOB) with mixed dentition, aged 10-13 years, underwent an IQ test, TOVA, SpO(2), and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Electrodes were set in the scalp, according to the 10-20 protocol. Data were analyzed using statistical tests to assess comparisons between children with and without AOB. The results showed that IQ, TOVA, SpO(2), or BPM did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups, except for the response time (contained in TOVA) (p= 0.03). Significant differences were found for the brain activity during rest (Condition 1) of the tongue, between children with and without AOB (p< 0.05 for alpha/theta and alpha peaks), whereas there were no differences during function (Condition 2). The findings of this investigation provide insights about the cortex activity of the brain while the tongue is in the resting position in children with AOB. This may imply an altered activity of the brain cortex, which should be considered when diagnosing and treating AOB. Other diagnostic techniques derived from investigations based on neuroscience could develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to give better solutions to children with malocclusions. Treatments should be focused not only on the teeth but also on the brain cortex.

Additional risk factors such as lower socioeconomic status (SES) may also have an impact on brain development for this population. This study examined how brain volumes are related to SES in both neurotypically developing children and adolescents, and those with PAE. 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE images were acquired from 69 participants with PAE (13.0 +/- 3.2 years, range 7.1-18.8 years, 49% female) and 70 neurotypical controls (12.4 +/- 2.9 years, range 7.0-18.5 years, 60% female) from four scanning sites in Canada. SES scores calculated using Hollingshead's Four-Factor Index of Social Status from current caregiver placement were not significantly different between groups, though more children with PAE had lower SES scores compared to controls. Psychometric data comprised 14 cognitive measures, including executive functioning, attention and working memory, memory, math/numerical ability, and word reading. All cognitive scores were significantly worse in children with PAE compared to controls, though SES was not correlated with cognitive scores in either group after correction for multiple comparisons. All 13 brain volumes were smaller in children with PAE compared to children in the control group. Higher SES was associated with larger hippocampus and amygdala volumes in controls, but there were no such associations in children with PAE. Direct evaluation of the interaction between SES and diagnostic group did not show a significant differential impact of SES on these structures. These findings support previous links between SES and brain volumes in neurotypically developing children, but the lack of such a relationship with SES in children with PAE may be due to the markedly smaller brain volumes resulting from the initial brain injury and postpartum brain development, regardless of later SES.

The participant-specific time window relative to the visual cue has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the CSP. However, the time window is usually selected experientially or manually. To solve this problem, we propose a novel feature selection approach for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, multiple time segments were obtained by decomposing each EEG sample of the MI task. Furthermore, the features were extracted by CSP from each time segment and were combined to form a new feature vector. Finally, the optimal temporal combination patterns for the new feature vector were selected based on four feature selection algorithms, i.e., mutual information, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, principal component analysis and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (denoted as MUIN, LASSO, PCA, and SWLDA, respectively), and the classification algorithm was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy. With three BCI competition datasets, the results of the four proposed algorithms were compared with traditional CSP algorithm in classification accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithm, the proposed methods significantly improve performance. Specifically, the LASSO achieved the highest accuracy (88.58%) among the proposed methods. Importantly, the average classification accuracies using the proposed approaches significantly improved 10.14% (MUIN), 11.40% (LASSO), 6.08% (PCA), and 10.25% (SWLDA) compared to that using CSP. These results indicate that the proposed approach is expected to be practical in MI-based BCIs.

Research findings suggest that theta (theta) oscillations (3-7 Hz) recorded over frontal-midline electrodes are broadly associated with a number of higher-order cognitive processes and may serve as the mechanistic backbone for cognitive control. Frontal-midline theta (FM theta) oscillations have also been shown to inversely correlate with activity in the default mode network (DMN), a network in the brain linked to spontaneous thought processes such as mind-wandering and rumination. In line with these findings, we previously observed increased FM theta oscillations in expert meditation practitioners during reported periods of focused-attention meditation practice when compared to periods of mind-wandering. In an effort to narrow the explanatory gap by directly connecting observed neurophysiological activity in the brain to the phenomenological nature of reported experience, we designed a methodologically novel and adaptive neurofeedback protocol with the aim of modulating FM theta while having meditation novice participants implement breath-focus strategies derived from focused-attention mediation practices. Participants who received eight sessions of the adaptive FM theta-meditation neurofeedback protocol were able to significantly modulate FM theta over frontal electrodes using focused-attention meditation strategies relative to their baseline by the end of the training and demonstrated significantly faster reaction times on correct trials during the n-back working memory task assessed before and after the FM theta-meditation neurofeedback protocol. No significant differences in frontal theta activity or behavior were observed in the active control participants who received age and gender matched sham neurofeedback. These findings help lay the groundwork for the development of brain training protocols and neurofeedback applications that aim to train features of the mental states and traits associated with focused-attention meditation.

We analyzed these medicines' call characteristics compared to their respective rest of calls (ROC) and thematically explored narratives concerning withdrawal and misuse.Results:Of 123,217 calls, 7,395 (6.0%) involved OA and 7,789 (6.2%) AHS, with consistency between call characteristics. While female middle-aged callers predominated, more males called for these medicines than their complementary ROC. Uncertainty about unresolved OA and AHS concerns led to help-seeking that was consistent over eight years. Main motivations were inadequate information (OA 44.5%; AHS 41.2%), seeking a second opinion (OA 24.2%; AHS 24.2%), worrying symptoms (OA 21.6%; AHS 23.1%), and conflicting information (OA 4.9%; AHS 5.1%). Callers focused on withdrawal and issues related to inadvertent overuse or deliberate misuse (OA 9.2% vs. non-OA ROC 2.9%; AHS 12.6% vs. non-AHS ROC 2.7%). Primary themes were similar for both cohorts: concern about harm or aiming to minimize harm by information seeking, requesting a strategy, or reassurance.Conclusions:Consumers have under-recognized perceptions of harm from OA and AHS use, particularly withdrawal and misuse. Resources based on real world consumer concerns can encourage open dialogue between patients and their prescribers.

Trail Making Test: Normative Data for Patients with Severe Alcohol Use Disorder								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	11			1790	1799		10.1080/10826084.2020.1765806			AUG 3 2020	2020	Background:Patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) often show cognitive impairment, particularly in executive functions that has been linked to poor treatment outcomes. The Trail Making Test (TMT) is the most widely used neuropsychological test to investigate executive functions with available normative data. However, no such norms exist for patients with AUD, although there is extensive evidence that TMT performance is altered in AUD patients.Purpose: To provide normative data for patients with AUD and compare the performance of AUD patients with already existing normative data from healthy subjects.Methods:Data of 494 recently detoxified patients with AUD who entered an abstinence-oriented residential treatment program were analyzed. Patients completed a standardized diagnostic procedure and the TMT Parts A and B at treatment admission.Results:AUD patients' performance on the TMT was impaired compared to the normative data of healthy individuals and decreased with increasing age and lower levels of education, with stronger effects in Part B assessing more complex executive functioning. Alcohol-related variables showed no direct associations with TMT performance.Conclusions:The results replicate the association of age and education with TMT performance, suggesting that AUD may be associated with impaired cognitive functioning earlier in life in abstinent patients shortly after withdrawal from alcohol compared to healthy individuals. The presented normative data for patients with AUD particularly improve the examination of executive deficits, and may enable clinicians to evaluate patients' cognitive functioning in treatment more precisely.

Methods Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 18 drug-naive patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Accumulated source imaging (ASI) was used to analyze MEG data at the source level in seven frequency ranges: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), gamma (30-80 Hz), ripple (80-250 Hz), and fast ripple (250-500 Hz). Result In the 1-4, 4-8, and 8-12 Hz ranges, the magnetic source during seizure termination appeared to be consistent over the ictal period and was mainly localized in the frontal cortex (FC) and parieto-occipito-temporal junction (POT). In the 12-30 and 30-80 Hz ranges, a significant reduction in source activity was observed in the frontal lobe during seizure termination as well as a decrease in peak source strength. The ictal peak source strength in the 1-4 Hz range was negatively correlated with the ictal duration of the seizure, whereas in the 30-80 Hz range, it was positively correlated with the course of epilepsy. Conclusion The termination of absence seizures is associated with a dynamic neuromagnetic process. Frequency-dependent changes in the FC were observed during seizure termination, which may be involved in the process of neural network interaction. Neuromagnetic activity in different frequency bands may play different roles in the pathophysiological mechanism during absence seizures.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tDCS paired with visuomotor step training can promote skill learning and retention. We hypothesized that pairing step training with anodal tDCS would improve skill learning and retention, evidenced by decreased step reaction times (RTs), both immediately (online skill gains) and 30 min after training (offline skill gains). Twenty healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of two groups, in which 20-min anodal or sham tDCS was applied to the lower limb motor cortex and paired with visuomotor step training. Step RTs were determined across three time points: (1) before brain stimulation (baseline); (2) immediately after brain stimulation (P0); and (3) 30 min after brain stimulation (P3). A continuous decline in RT was observed in the anodal tDCS group at both P0 and P3, with a significant decrease in RT at P3; whereas there were no improvements in RT at P0 and P3 in the sham group. These findings do not support our hypothesis that anodal tDCS enhances online learning, as RT was not decreased significantly immediately after stimulation. Nevertheless, the results indicate that anodal tDCS enhances offline learning, as RT was significantly decreased 30 min after stimulation, likely because of tDCS-induced neural modulation of cortical and subcortical excitability, synaptic efficacy, and spinal neuronal activity.

Eavesdropping on Autobiographical Memory: A Naturalistic Observation Study of Older Adults' Memory Sharing in Daily Conversations								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						238	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00238			JUN 26 2020	2020	The retrieval of autobiographical memories is an integral part of everyday social interactions. Prior laboratory research has revealed that older age is associated with a reduction in the retrieval of autobiographical episodic memories, and the ability to elaborate these memories with episodic details. However, how age-related reductions in episodic specificity unfold in everyday social contexts remains largely unknown. Also, constraints of the laboratory-based approach have limited our understanding of how autobiographical semantic memory is linked to older age. To address these gaps in knowledge, we used a smartphone application known as the Electronically Activated Recorder, or "EAR," to unobtrusively capture real-world conversations over 4 days. In a sample of 102 cognitively normal older adults, we extracted instances where memories and future thoughts were shared by the participants, and we scored the shared episodic memories and future thoughts for their make-up of episodic and semantic detail. We found that older age was associated with a reduction in real-world sharing of autobiographical episodic and semantic memories. We also found that older age was linked to less episodically and semantically detailed descriptions of autobiographical episodic memories. Frequency and level of detail of shared future thoughts yielded weaker relationships with age, which may be related to the low frequency of future thoughts in general. Similar to laboratory research, there was no correlation between autobiographical episodic detail sharing and a standard episodic memory test. However, in contrast to laboratory studies, episodic detail production while sharing autobiographical episodic memories was weakly related to episodic detail production while describing future events, unrelated to working memory, and not different between men and women. Overall, our findings provide novel evidence of how older age relates to episodic specificity when autobiographical memories are assessed unobtrusively and objectively "in the wild."

Case Report on Deep Brain Stimulation Rescue After Suboptimal MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Essential Tremor: A Tractography-Based Investigation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						191	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00191			JUN 26 2020	2020	Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder in adults, and can often be medically refractory, requiring surgical intervention. MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a less invasive procedure that uses ultrasonic waves to induce lesions in the ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) to treat refractory ET. As with all procedures for treating ET, optimal targeting during MRgFUS is essential for efficacy and durability. Various studies have reported cases of tremor recurrence following MRgFUS and long-term outcome data is limited to 3-4 years. We present a tractography-based investigation on a case of DBS rescue for medically refractory ET that was treated with MRgFUS that was interrupted due to the development of dysarthria during the procedure. After initial improvement, her hand tremor started to recur within 6 months after treatment, and bilateral DBS was performed targeting the VIM 24 months after MRgFUS. DBS induced long-term tremor control with monopolar stimulation. Diffusion MRI tractography was used to reconstruct the dentatorubrothalamic (DRTT) and corticothalmic (CTT) tracts being modulated by the procedures to understand the variability in efficacy between MRgFUS and DBS in treating ET in our patient. By comparing the MRgFUS lesion and DBS volume of activated tissue (VAT), we found that the MRgFUS lesion was located ventromedially to the VAT, and was less than 10% of the size of the VAT. While the lesion encompassed the same proportion of DRTT streamlines, it encompassed fewer CTT streamlines than the VAT. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation of targeting the CTT when using neuromodulatory procedures to treat refractory ET for more permanent tremor relief.

J	Young, David R.; Parikh, Pranav J.; Layne, Charles S.								Non-invasive Brain Stimulation of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Alters Postural Adaptation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						248	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00248			JUN 26 2020	2020	Effective central sensory integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive information is required to promote adaptability in response to changes in the environment during postural control. Patients with a lesion in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have an impaired ability to form an internal representation of body position, an important factor for postural control and adaptation. Suppression of PPC excitability has also been shown to decrease postural stability in some contexts. As of yet, it is unknown whether stimulation of the PPC may influence postural adaptation. This investigation aimed to identify whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the bilateral PPC could modulate postural adaptation in response to a bipedal incline postural adaptation task. Using young, healthy subjects, we delivered tDCS over bilateral PPC followed by bouts of inclined stance (incline-interventions). Analysis of postural after-effects identified differences between stimulation conditions for maximum lean after-effect (LAE;p= 0.005) as well as a significant interaction between condition and measurement period for the average position (p= 0.03). We identified impaired postural adaptability following both active stimulation conditions. Results reinforce the notion that the PPC is involved in motor adaptation and extend this line of research to the realm of standing posture. The results further highlight the role of the bilateral PPC in utilizing sensory feedback to update one's internal representation of verticality and demonstrates the diffuse regions of the brain that are involved in postural control and adaptation. This information improves our understanding of the role of the cortex in postural control, highlighting the potential for the PPC as a target for sensorimotor rehabilitation.

In addition, we examined if adolescents' depressive symptoms have any mediating effects on opioid misuse.Methods:We used the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data, and two substantive models with binary logistic regressions. Three social capital variables were added to the full model with control for sociodemographic and health status variables. A mediation analysis was estimated for family and school social capital, major depressive episodes in the past year, and opioid misuse.Results:We found statistically significant relationships between adolescent opioid misuse and family and school social capital. Adolescents' odds of opioid misuse decreased 10% with each additional family situation where they felt supported. Not knowing students in their grade who drank alcohol or used marijuana/hashish decreased the odds of misusing opioids 42% (p< .01). Experience of depressive episodes acted as a mediator for the social capital effects on adolescents' opioid misuse.Conclusions:Our findings lend support that opioid misuse is associated with despair, and therefore, opioid prevention programs need to incorporate strategies to address mental health issues as well. Our findings also underscore the need for focusing on increasing parental awareness and involvement as well as scaling up prevention efforts in high schools where substance abuse is relatively higher.

Several actors may facilitate or act as a barrier to a successful return to work (RTW). This qualitative study used semi-structured in-depth interviews with 22 adults with mTBI at 2-5 years post injury, targeting experiences of how different actors facilitated or acted as a barrier in the RTW process, and encompassed the mTBI trajectory from the acute phase to the post-acute phase. A thematic analysis with a hermeneutical phenomenological approach was used to analyse data. Three main themes emerged. (1) Worker-employer relationship: Workplace accommodations such as decreased working hours, modified working conditions, and support from co-workers were lacking. (2) The role of the general practitioner: The general practitioner was lacking treatment and referral opportunities and failed to provide the patient with relevant and individualized guidance. (3) Municipal case management: Participants perceived being met with distrust by social workers, follow-up assessments were too frequent, unnecessary, and did not target concussion, and rehabilitation was referred too late. Clinical practice guidelines to improve referral to relevant concussion rehabilitation in case of persistent symptoms are needed to inform clinicians, employers, and public institutions to facilitate a successful RTW.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 2 mA and 4 mA anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on performance fatigability and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the leg muscles during a maximal isokinetic task in healthy young adults. A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study design was applied. Twenty-seven active young adults completed four sessions, each spaced by 5-8 days. During session 1, dominance was verified with isokinetic strength testing, and subjects were familiarized with the fatigue task (FT). The FT protocol included 40 continuous maximum isokinetic contractions of the knee extensors and flexors (120 degrees/s, concentric/concentric). During Sessions 2-4, tDCS was applied for 20 min with one of three randomly assigned intensities (sham, 2 mA or 4 mA) and the FT was repeated. The anode and cathode of the tDCS device were placed over C3 and the contralateral supraorbital area, respectively. A wireless EMG system collected muscle activity during the FT. The 2 mA tDCS condition had significantly less torque (65.9 +/- 32.7 Nm) during the FT than both the sham (68.4 +/- 33.9 Nm,p< 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (68.4 +/- 33.9 Nm,p= 0.001). Furthermore, the 2 mA condition (33.8 +/- 11.7%) had significantly less EMG activity during the FT than both the sham (39.7 +/- 10.6%,p< 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (40.5 +/- 13.4%,p= 0.001). Contrary to previous submaximal isometric fatigue investigations, the 2 mA tDCS condition significantly reduced torque production and EMG activity of the leg extensors during a maximal isokinetic FT compared with the sham and 4 mA conditions. Also, torque production and EMG activity in the 4 mA condition were not significantly different from sham. Thus, the effects of tDCS, and the underlying mechanisms, might not be the same for different tasks and warrants more investigation.

Secondary Worsening Following DYT1 Dystonia Deep Brain Stimulation: A Multi-country Cohort								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						242	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00242			JUN 25 2020	2020	Objective: To reveal clinical characteristics of suboptimal responses to deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a multi-country DYT1 dystonia cohort. Methods: In this multi-country multi-center retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical data of DYT1 patients who experienced suboptimal responses to DBS defined as Results: Approximately 8% of our study cohort (11 out of 132) experienced suboptimal responses to DBS. Compared with the historical cohort, the multi-country cohort with suboptimal responses had a significantly younger age at onset (mean, 7.0 vs. 8.4 years;p= 0.025) and younger age at DBS (mean, 12.0 vs. 18.6 years;p= 0.019). Additionally, cranial involvement was more common in the multi-country cohort (before DBS, 64% vs. 45%,p= 0.074; before or after DBS, 91% vs. 47%,p= 0.001). Mean motor improvement at the last follow-up from baseline were 0% and 66% for the multi-country and historical cohorts, respectively. All 11 patients of the multi-country cohort had generalization of dystonia within 2.5 years after disease onset. All patients experienced dystonia improvement of >30% postoperatively; however, secondary worsening of dystonia commenced between 6 months and 3 years following DBS. The improvement at the last follow-up was less than 30% despite optimally-placed leads, a trial of multiple programming settings, and additional DBS surgeries in all patients. The on-/off-stimulation comparison at the long-term follow-up demonstrated beneficial effects of DBS despite missing the threshold of 30% improvement over baseline. Conclusion: Approximately 8% of patients represent a more aggressive phenotype of DYT1 dystonia characterized by younger age at onset, faster disease progression, and cranial involvement, which seems to be associated with long-term suboptimal responses to DBS (e.g., secondary worsening). This information could be useful for both clinicians and patients in clinical decision making and patient counseling before and following DBS implantations.

J	Vieillard, Sandrine; Pinabiaux, Charlotte; Bigand, Emmanuel								Positive and Detached Reappraisal of Threatening Music in Younger and Older Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						216	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00216			JUN 25 2020	2020	Past empirical studies have suggested that older adults preferentially use gaze-based mood regulation to lessen their negative experiences while watching an emotional scene. This preference for a low cognitively demanding regulatory strategy leaves open the question of whether the effortful processing of a more cognitively demanding reappraisal task is really spared from the general age-related decline. Because it does not allow perceptual attention to be redirected away from the emotional source, music provides an ideal way to address this question. The goal of our study was to examine the affective, behavioral, physiological, and cognitive outcomes of positive and detached reappraisal in response to negative musical emotion in younger and older adults. Participants first simply listened to a series of threatening musical excerpts and were then instructed to either positively reappraise or to detach themselves from the emotion elicited by music. Findings showed that, when instructed to simply listen to threatening music, older adults reported a more positive feeling associated with a smaller SCL in comparison with their younger counterparts. When implementing positive and detached reappraisal, participants showed more positive and more aroused emotional experiences, whatever the age group. We also found that the instruction to intentionally reappraise negative emotions results in a lesser cognitive cost for older adults in comparison with younger adults. Taken together, these data suggest that, compared to younger adults, older adults engage in spontaneous downregulation of negative affect and successfully implement downregulation instructions. This extends previous findings and brings compelling evidence that, even when auditory attention cannot be redirected away from the emotional source, older adults are still more effective at regulating emotions. Taking into account the age-associated decline in executive functioning, our results suggest that the working memory task could have distracted older adults from the reminiscences of the threat-evoking music, thus resulting in an emotional downregulation. Hence, even if they were instructed to implement reappraisal strategies, older adults might prefer distraction over engagement in reappraisal. This is congruent with the idea that, although getting older, people are more likely to be distracted from a negative source of emotion to maintain their well-being.

However, its neural correlate remains to be discovered, especially in the perspective of two-person neuroscience. In this study, 12 dyads of basketball players and 12 dyads of college students who had no experience of team-based sports training were asked to perform joint-drawing task and control task. During task performance, neural activities were recorded in frontal area by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning approach. The results demonstrated that dyads of basketball players were faster to finish joint-drawing task and showed higher subjective cooperativeness than dyads of college students. Meanwhile, significant interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) was observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal area only when pairs of basketball players performed joint-drawing task, but not control task. Therefore, we provide the first piece of inter-brain evidence for enhanced cooperative behavior in the individuals with team-based sports training, which could make us deeply understand exact neural correlate for experience-dependent changes of cognitions in humans.

In music, discrete elements are always organized into complex nested structures to convey emotion. However, the processing of music tension in the nested structure remains unknown. The present study investigated the tension experience induced by the nested structure and the underlying neural mechanisms, using a continuous tension rating task and electroencephalography (EEG) at the same time. Thirty musicians listened to music chorale sequences with non-nested, singly nested and doubly nested structures and were required to rate their real-time tension experience. Behavioral data indicated that the tension experience induced by the nested structure had more fluctuations than the non-nested structure, and the difference was mainly exhibited in the process of tension induction rather than tension resolution. However, the EEG data showed that larger late positive components (LPCs) were elicited by the ending chords in the nested structure compared with the non-nested structure, reflecting the difference in cognitive integration for long-distance structural dependence. The discrepancy between resolution experience and neural responses revealed the non-parallel relations between emotion and cognition. Furthermore, the LPC elicited by the doubly nested structure showed a smaller scalp distribution than the singly nested structure, indicating the more difficult processing of the doubly nested structure. These findings revealed the dynamic tension experience induced by the nested structure and the influence of nested type, shedding new light on the relationship between structure and tension in music.

Neuroimaging and Neuropsychological Outcomes Following Clinician-Delivered Cognitive Training for Six Patients With Mild Brain Injury: A Multiple Case Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						229	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00229			JUN 24 2020	2020	Nearly half of all mild brain injury sufferers experience long-term cognitive impairment, so an important goal in rehabilitation is to address their multiple cognitive deficits to help them return to prior levels of functioning. Cognitive training, or the use of repeated mental exercises to enhance cognition, is one remediation method for brain injury. The primary purpose of this hypothesis-generating pilot study was to explore the statistical and clinical significance of cognitive changes and transfer of training to real-life functioning following 60 h of Brain Booster, a clinician-delivered cognitive training program, for six patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) or non-traumatic acquired brain injury (ABI). The secondary purpose was to explore changes in functional connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive test gains following the training. We used a multiple case study design to document significant changes in cognitive test scores, overall IQ score, and symptom ratings; and we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore trends in functional network connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive change. All cognitive test scores showed improvement with statistically significant changes on five of the seven measures (long-term memory, processing speed, reasoning, auditory processing, and overall IQ score). The mean change in IQ score was 20 points, from a mean of 108 to a mean of 128. Five themes emerged from the qualitative data analysis including improvements in cognition, mood, social identity, performance, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). With MRI, we documented significant region-to-region changes in connectivity following cognitive training including those involving the cerebellum and cerebellar networks. We also found significant correlations between changes in IQ score and change in white matter integrity of bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the left uncinate fasciculus. This study adds to the growing body of literature examining the effects of cognitive training for mild TBI and ABI, and to the collection of research on the benefits of cognitive training in general.

To explore the possible differences in the influence of motivation on behavioral performance and neural activity in high and low vigilance levels, we conducted a prolonged 2 h 20 min flanker task and provided monetary rewards during the 20- to 40- and 100- to 120-min intervals of task performance. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological measures were modulated by prolonged task engagement. Moreover, the effect of reward was different in high vs. low vigilance states. The monetary reward increased accuracy and decreased the reaction time (RT) and number of omitted responses in the low but not in the high vigilance state. The fatigue-related decrease in P300 amplitude recovered to its level in the high vigilance state by manipulating motivation, whereas the fatigue-related increase in P300 latency was not modulated by reward. Additionally, the fatigue-related increase in event-related spectral power at 1-4 Hz was sensitive to vigilance decrement and reward. However, the spectral power at 4-8 Hz was only affected by the decrease in vigilance. These electrophysiological measures were not influenced by motivation in the state of high vigilance. Our results suggest that neural processing capacity, but not the timing of processing, is sensitive to motivation. These findings also imply that the fatigue-related impairments in behavioral performance and neural activity underlying selective visual attention only partly recover after manipulating motivation. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the dissociable neural mechanisms underlying the fatigue-related decrease vs. reward-related increase in attentional resources.

This study aims to describe the processes underlying implicit electroencephalographic neurofeedback. Fifty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a single session of infra-low frequency neurofeedback or sham neurofeedback, with electrodes over the right middle temporal gyrus and the right inferior parietal lobule. They observed a moving rocket, the speed of which was modulated by the waveform derived from a band-limited infra-low frequency filter. Immediately before and after the session, the participants underwent a resting-state fMRI. Network-based statistical analysis was applied, comparing post- vs. pre-session and real vs. sham neurofeedback conditions. As a result, two phenomena were observed. First, we described a brain circuit related to the implicit neurofeedback process itself, consisting of the lateral occipital cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, right ventral striatum, and bilateral dorsal striatum. Second, we found increased connectivity between key regions of the salience, language, and visual networks, which is indicative of integration in sensory processing. Thus, it appears that a single session of implicit infra-low frequency electroencephalographic neurofeedback leads to significant changes in intrinsic brain connectivity.

Analyses were restricted to participants who engaged in nonmedical PO use and used generalized estimating equations.Results:Among 599 participants who used POs nonmedically, 82 (14%) individuals reported acquiring POs exclusively from a physician and 197 (33%) experienced a non-fatal overdose at some point over the study period. Acquiring POs exclusively from physicians was significantly and negatively associated with non-fatal overdose in the bivariate analysis (Odds Ratio = 0.60, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.39-0.94) but not the final multivariate analysis (Adjusted Odds Ratio =0.87, 95% CI: 0.53-1.44).Conclusions:Compared to individuals who acquired POs from friends or the streets, participants who acquired POs exclusively from a physician were not at an increased risk of non-fatal overdose. Although responsible opioid prescribing is an important priority, additional strategies to address nonmedical PO use are urgently needed to reduce overdose and related morbidity and mortality.

J	Brown, Steven								The "Who" System of the Human Brain: A System for Social Cognition About the Self and Others								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						224	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00224			JUN 19 2020	2020	Neuroscientists are fond of talking about brain systems for the processing of "what" and "where" information about objects and their locations. What is critically missing is the concept of a "who" system dedicated to the neural processing of information about social agents-both the self and others-and their interactions. I propose here the characterization of such a system, one that functions not only in perception but in production as well, such as when recounting stories about oneself and others. The most human-specific features of the "who" system are two complementary systems that I refer to as theother-as-selfmechanism and theself-as-othermechanism. The major function of the other-as-self mechanism is to perceive other people egocentrically as proxies of the self, as occurs through the processes of mentalizing and empathizing in both everyday life and in the experience of the theatrical and literary arts. The major function of the self-as-other mechanism is to overtly depict other people during acts of communication through vocal and gestural processes of mimicry, such as occurs during quotation in conversation and through acting in the theatrical arts. Overall, the "who" system of the human brain mediates both perceptual and behavioral aspects of social cognition, and establishes the existential distinction between self and other in human cognition. I present neural models for the instantiation of the "who" system in the human brain and conclude with a discussion of how narrative serves as a foundation for human cognition more generally, what I refer to as narrative-based cognition.

Multisensory integration mechanisms, largely spared in USN patients, may temporally modulate spatial orienting. In this pilot study, the effects of an intensive audio-visual Multisensory Stimulation (MS) on USN were assessed, and compared with those of a treatment that ameliorates USN, Prismatic Adaptation (PA). Twenty USN stroke patients received a 2-week treatment (20 sessions, twice per day) of MS or PA. The effects of MS and PA were assessed by a set of neuropsychological clinical tests (target cancellation, line bisection, sentence reading, personal neglect, complex drawing) and the Catherine Bergego Scale for functional disability. Results showed that MS brought about an amelioration of USN deficits overall comparable to that induced by PA; personal neglect was improved only by MS, not by PA. The clinical gains of the MS treatment were not influenced by duration of disease and lesion volume, and they persisted up to one month post-treatment. In conclusion, MS represents a novel and promising rehabilitation procedure for USN.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						235	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00235			JUN 19 2020	2020	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique able to modulate cortical excitability. This modulation may influence areas and networks responsible for specific cognitive processes, and the repetition of the induced temporary changes can produce long-lasting effects. TMS effectiveness may be enhanced when used in conjunction with cognitive training focused on specific cognitive functions. Playing video games can be an optimal cognitive training since it involves different cognitive components and high levels of engagement and motivation. The goal of this study is to assess the synergistic effects of TMS and video game training to enhance cognition, specifically, working memory and executive functions. We conducted a randomized 2 x 3 repeated measures (stimulation x time) study, randomly assigning 27 healthy volunteers to an active intermittent theta-burst stimulation or a sham stimulation group. Participants were assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery before, immediately after, and 15 days after finishing the video game+TMS training. The training consisted of 10 sessions where participants played a 3D platform video game for 1.5 h. After each gaming session, TMS was applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All participants improved their video gaming performance, but we did not find a synergistic effect of stimulation and video game training. Neither had we found cognitive improvements related to the stimulation. We explored possible confounding variables such as age, gender, and early video gaming experience through linear regression. The early video gaming experience was related to improvements in working memory and inhibitory control. This result, although exploratory, highlights the influence of individual variables and previous experiences on brain plasticity.

The current study aimed to investigate the relationships of sleep disturbance and fatigue with cognition while controlling for psychological distress and age. Using a prospective observational design, we assessed 60 premorbidly healthy individuals approximately 8 weeks after mTBI. Participants were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory as well as measures of speed of information processing, attention, memory, and executive function; depression and anxiety were also assessed. Findings revealed associations between sleep disturbance and cognition (r(2 )= .586,p < .001) as well as between fatigue and cognition (r(2 )= .390,p < .01), independent of the impact of psychological status and age. Associations were evident in the domains of processing speed, attention, and memory, but were most consistently apparent on measures of executive function. Greater sleep disturbance was most consistently associated with poorer cognitive function. Unexpectedly, higher levels of fatigue were associated with better cognitive function, which may be explained by the coping hypothesis. Given sleep interventions have been shown to improve sleep disturbance, these findings suggest that sleep intervention may also result in improved cognition after mTBI.		[Anderson, Jacqueline F.

Functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively inspect the intricate functional organization of the human MB with a high degree of spatial resolution. The present study divided the human MB into lateral and medial parts and examined their functional connectivity with the hippocampal formation, tegmental nuclei, and anterior thalamus. The subiculum of the hippocampal formation was more strongly connected with the medial part than with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the pre/parasubiculum was more strongly connected with the lateral part than with the medial part of the MB. The dorsal tegmental nucleus was connected more strongly with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the ventral tegmental nucleus showed an opposite pattern. The anterior thalamus was connected more strongly with the medial part of the MB. These results confirm the extant animal literature on the lateral/medial MB and provide evidence on the parallel but dissociable systems involving the MB that ascribe mnemonic and spatial-navigation functions to the medial and lateral MBs, respectively.

J	Coulborn, Sean; Bowman, Howard; Miall, R. Chris; Fernandez-Espejo, Davinia								Effect of tDCS Over the Right Inferior Parietal Lobule on Mind-Wandering Propensity								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						230	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00230			JUN 18 2020	2020	Mind-wandering is associated with switching our attention to internally directed thoughts and is by definition an intrinsic, self-generated cognitive function. Interestingly, previous research showed that it may be possible to modulate its propensity externally, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting different regions in the default mode and executive control networks (ECNs). However, these studies used highly heterogeneous montages (targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), or both concurrently), often showed contradicting results, and in many cases failed to replicate. Our study aimed to establish whether tDCS of the default mode network (DMN),viatargeting the right IPL alone, could modulate mind-wandering propensity using a within-subjects double-blind, counterbalanced design. Participants completed sustained attention to response task (SART) interspersed with thought-probes to capture their subjective reports of mind-wandering before and after receiving anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the right IPL (with the reference over the left cheek). We found evidence for the lack of an effect of stimulation on subjective reports of mind-wandering (JZS-BF01= 5.19), as well as on performance on the SART task (errors (JZS-BF01= 6.79) and reaction time (JZS-BF01= 5.94). Overall, we failed to replicate previous reports of successful modulations of mind-wandering propensity with tDCS over the IPL, instead of providing evidence in support of the lack of an effect. This and other recent unsuccessful replications call into question whether it is indeed possible to externally modulate spontaneous or self-generated cognitive processes.

Effect of Short-Term Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) on Brain Processing of Food Cues: An Electrophysiological Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						206	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00206			JUN 18 2020	2020	Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. Modulating vagal activityviaelectrical stimulation (VNS) in patients and animal studies caused changes in food intake, energy metabolism, and body weight. However, the moderating impact of cognitive processes on VNS effects on eating behavior has not been investigated so far. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) affects food intake by altering cognitive functions relevant to the processing of food-related information. Methods: Using a repeated-measurement design, we applied tVNS and a sham stimulation for 2 h on two different days in normal-weight subjects. We recorded standard scalp EEG while subjects watched food and object pictures presented in an oddball task. We analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) P1, P2, N2, and LPP and also examined the amount of consumed food and eating duration in a free-choice test meal. Results: Significant differences between stimulations were observed for the P1, P2, and N2 amplitudes. However, we found no tVNS-dependent modulation of food intake nor a specific food-related stimulation effect on the ERPs. Further analyses revealed a negative relationship between P2 amplitude and food intake for the sham stimulation. Significant effects are additionally confirmed by Bayesian statistics. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates tVNS' impact on visual processing. Since the effects were similar between food and object stimuli, a general effect on visual perceptual processing can be assumed. More detailed investigations of these effects and their relationship with food intake and metabolism seem reasonable for future studies.

Based on their preference, participants used only one of the tobacco products (ENDS, HTPs, or conventional cigarette) and were briefed about the product use based on manufacturer's instructions. The eCO levels were obtained at baseline, followed by 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 min respectively after the product use.Results:There was significant increase in eCO levels for conventional cigarettes as compared to other modes. Peak eCO levels of 20.2 +/- 0.86 ppm, 8.8 +/- 1.56 ppm and 6.0 +/- 1.36 ppm was achieved at 30 min, 15 min and 10 min for conventional cigarettes, ENDS and HTPs respectively. However, the levels were significantly lower in ENDS and HTPs.Conclusion:Even though ENDS and HTPs may have produced significantly lower eCO than conventional cigarettes, the significantly increasing levels over time from baseline which was not shown before is a cause of concern. As of now, their use as an alternate to cigarettes needs to be considered under regulatory framework.		[Nga, Janice Diong Li] Int Med Univ, Sch Dent, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Hakim, S.

Various factors have been associated with increased likelihood of OD, including history of injection drug use.Purpose:This study examined multi-level factors associated with non-fatal OD among current people who inject drugs (PWID) in Appalachian Kentucky.Methods:This cross-sectional study utilized data from 324 PWID recruitedviaRespondent-Driven Sampling techniques in three Appalachian counties. The analysis focused on correlates of overdose history among people who inject drugs (PWID).Findings:Approximately 36.7% of our sample reported having overdosed in their lifetime, with only 21.4% currently having access to a naloxone kit for OD reversal. Respondents who had injected fentanyl alone or in combination with another drug (OR = 4.26, 95% CI= 2.31,7.86) had 4 times higher odds of an OD than those who did not. Our study found those who injected buprenorphine as primary drug (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.10,0.81) had lower odds of OD compared to those who injected heroin.Conclusions/Importance:Given an increase in OD prevalence among PWID in the U.S, and especially among people living in the Appalachian region of Kentucky, assessing factors associated with OD is critical in development of tailored public health interventions to address the disparate rates of non-fatal OD in this vulnerable population.

The aim of this study was to explore the ways in which experienced allied health clinicians establish and maintain alliances with people with stroke-related communication impairment, and to identify factors that may influence the strength of these alliances. In-depth interviews were completed with 11 clinicians from the disciplines of occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and physiotherapy. Interview transcripts were coded and analysed using strategies consistent with constructivist grounded theory. Participants described processes that were captured by the themes of enabling interaction, being responsive, building relational capital and building credibility. Practices that supported communication and emphasized responding, both within an interaction and over time, aligned with examples of strong alliances. Professional credibility and relational practices such as everyday conversations and the use of humour were viewed as important. Difficulty accessing a shared mode of communication due to stroke-related communication impairment altered relational processes and influenced perceptions of the alliance, although examples of strong alliances were present. In this study, reflections on challenging alliances highlighted potentially helpful practices. A responsive approach to rehabilitation, supported by reflective practice, may assist clinicians to better navigate their working alliances with this population.

Because maintenance is impaired in aging, we investigated whether older adults can also benefit from the temporal regularities for maintenance and how their cognitive capacities might affect this potential benefit. Methods Healthy older adults (range: 63-90 years old) had to memorize visually presented letters and maintain them in short-term memory for 6 s until recall. The six-second retention interval was either filled with an isochronous rhythmic sound sequence that provided a temporally regular structure or silent. Results The effect of the isochronous rhythm on recall performance was modulated by inhibition capacities of older adults: as compared to silence, improved recall performance thanks to the rhythm emerged with increased inhibitory capacity of the participants. Conclusion Even though maintenance of older adults benefits less from the presence of temporal regularities than does the maintenance of younger ones, our findings provide evidence for improved maintenance in short-term memory for older adults in the presence of a temporally regular structure, probably due to enhanced attentional refreshing. It further provides perspectives for training and rehabilitation of age-related working memory deficits.

J	Wu, Yan; Hall, Alisha S.

Parental investment theory and social role theory predict that women trust less than men due to a higher sensitivity to risk and betrayal, while men trust more than women to maximize resources and to signal their willingness to lose something. However, the underlying neuropsychological underpinnings for this gender difference are still obscure. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural signatures of gender differences in trust by simultaneously scanning 11 male and 11 female same-gender, fixed dyads who played a multi-round binary trust game with varying levels of payoff (low/moderate/high) as an indicator of social risk. Our results showed that men trusted more than women and payoff level moderated the effect of gender on trust. While men trusted the same at all payoff levels, women trusted less with higher payoff levels. This pattern was supported by our neuroimaging finding: men showed a higher activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and right precuneus than women, indicating that men exert more effort to inhibit the information of payoff levels and to use self-referencing to infer the strategies of partners with the goal of maximizing profit. Furthermore, men showed equivalent activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex across payoff levels, whereas women showed a decreased activation with increasing payoff level - indicating decreased group bonding with higher risk in women. In conclusion, our results imply that women are more sensitive to social risk while trusting, which has implications for financial interactions, interpersonal relationships, and social involvement.

However, the after-effects of TBS on the swallowing motor cortex remain uncertain. The newly developed graph-based analysis of the centrality approach has been increasingly used to explore brain networks. The purpose of this study was to identify degree centrality (DC) alterations in the brain network after different TBS protocols were performed over the suprahyoid muscles motor cortex in healthy subjects. A total of 40 right-handed healthy subjects (mean age: 23.73 +/- 2.57 years, range: 21-30, 20 females) were included in this study and randomly assigned to two groups, including the continuous TBS (cTBS) group and the intermittent TBS (iTBS) group. All of the subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning before and after TBS implementation. Compared to the baseline, cTBS resulted in increased DC values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (P< 0.01). In the iTBS group, decreased DC was observed in the left cerebellum and left medial frontal gyrus; However, increased DC was observed in several brain areas including the right superior temporal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right postcentral gyri and left paracentral lobule (P< 0.01). These results indicated that cTBS mainly results in increasing DC in the ipsilateral. However, iTBS is capable of facilitating the excitability of the swallowing motor cortex and increasing the connectivity of multiple brain regions, including the bilateral sensorimotor network, and might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of swallowing disorders.

Few papers detail therapeutic ingredients or outline the number of times these were delivered over the treatment period. The present observational study identified therapeutic ingredients in the Very Early Rehabiltiation in SpEech (VERSE) trial and explored the dosage provided using a model of cumulative intervention intensity (CII). Therapists video recorded one therapy session per week and 53 (12%) randomly selected therapy videos were analysed. The videos were coded for number of error productions, self-corrections and type and frequency of therapist cueing. The Western Aphasia Battery Revised-Aphasia Quotient (WABR-AQ) was used for measuring patient outcome with total verbal utterances (p < 0.001) and cues used with success (p < 0.001) being independent positive predictors of WABR-AQ score at six months post stroke and hypothesized as key therapeutic ingredients. The CII was calculated by counting identified therapeutic ingredients and multiplying this by the number of sessions completed. Collectively, the key ingredients occurred on average 504 times per session and over 10,000 times per participant during the treatment period. This paper reports a novel approach for identifying key treatment ingredients and detailing the dosage delivered within an early aphasia rehabilitation trial.

Speculation regarding the neural mediation of this effect points to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is known to have inhibitory connections with threat responsive brain regions such as the amygdala. Despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, a link between the vmPFC and diminished threat during handholding has been difficult to demonstrate empirically. Here we report that in a sample of 110 participants no evidence for vmPFC mediation of the handholding effect was obtained. Indeed, results indicated that connectivity patterns between threat responsive salience network structures and the vmPFC were in the opposite direction one would predict if the vmPFC mediated reductions in neural threat-responding caused by partner handholding. Our findings suggest that the vmPFC does not mediate the regulating effect of physical contact on neural threat responses.

The objective was to describe knowledge and practices in the assessment of SN in current clinical practice across different healthcare sectors and professions. Data included the perceived prevalence, assessment methods and observations, subtypes and differential diagnostics of SN. A total of 525 professionals participated in the survey. The vast majority (81.5%) reported that assessment of SN was provided by their workplace. The median of perceived prevalence of SN was 35% (IQR 22-51) but major differences were found between professions. Occupational therapists and psychologists appeared to be most involved in assessment, whilst nursing staff and speech therapists were least involved. Subjective observations were the most common assessment method (90%). Conversely, systematic ADL observations, paper-and-pencil tests, confrontational tests and computerized tests were less common. The survey revealed large differences in the assessment methods and awareness of various aspects of SN symptoms (subtypes and differential diagnostics) between different healthcare professions. The results emphasize the need for international multidisciplinary clinical guidelines on how to assess SN and distinguish between different subtypes and differential diagnoses.

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is an effective type of physical therapy for minimizing vestibular symptoms, as it improves vestibular compensation in patients with VM. Currently, the cerebral regions that are associated with the pathogenesis of VM are largely unknown. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of VM, we performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after 1 month of VR in 14 patients with VM. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were included as clinical outcomes. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was assessed to characterize spontaneous brain activity. The correlations between the clinical characteristics and ALFF values were assessed. After 1 month of VR training, the DHI scores in patients with VM were significantly lower than those at baseline (p= 0.03), as were the HAMA scores (p= 0.02). We also found that the ALFF values in the left posterior cerebellum of VM patients increased significantly after 1 month of VR training. Moreover, the ALFF values in the left cerebellum were inversely correlated with the patients' DHI scores. Overall, this study showed that VR exercise for 1 month has a positive effect on vestibular symptoms in patients with VM.

Despite this well accepted problem, the various components associated with tobacco use across gender remain relatively unknown.Objectives:The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between tobacco use and negative moods (anxiety, depression, stress) between men and women. The relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and attitudes about smoking was also investigated.Methods:A questionnaire was used to determine sociodemographic characteristics, negative moods, EI, smoking behavior, and tobacco-related attitudes (N = 350).Results:Amongst individuals who used tobacco products, women reported greater disturbances in stress and anxiety compared to men. In addition, both men and women who used tobacco products reported higher depression scores compared to nonsmokers, however, no gender differences were observed. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that higher EI scores explained negative attitudes about smoking in relation to health concerns. Lastly, women reported stronger attitudes for the restriction of cigarette sales and marketing of tobacco products.Conclusion:These findings support the literature by showing that mood dysregulation is an important factor associated with tobacco use among women. Additionally, we report that specific aspects of EI are psychological constructs closely linked with attitudes about smoking. Future studies elucidating the various components of tobacco use across gender might lead to more effective treatments for smoking.

A Study on the Voluntary Up-Regulation of the Sensorimotor Rhythm								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						218	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00218			JUN 10 2020	2020	The core learning mechanisms of neurofeedback (NF) training are associative, implicit, and, consequently, largely impervious to consciousness. Many other aspects of training that determine training outcomes, however, are accessible to conscious processing. The outcomes of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) up-regulation training are related to the strategies reported by participants. The classification methods of individual strategies employed hitherto were possibly under influence of the idiosyncratic interpretation of the rater. To measure and possibly overcome this limitation, we employed independent raters to analyze strategies reported during SMR up-regulation training. Sixty-two healthy young participants took part in a single session of SMR up-regulation training. After completing six blocks of training, in which they received either simple visual feedback or a gamified version thereof, participants were required to report the strategies employed. Their individual learning outcomes were computed as well. Results point out that individual strategies as well as NF learning outcomes were not particularly sensitive to the presence of gamified elements in training the SMR up-regulation. A high degree of consistency across independent raters classifying strategy reports was observed. Some strategies were more typical of responders while other ones were more common among non-responders. In summary, we demonstrate a more objective and transparent way to analyze individual mental strategies to shed more light on the differences between NF responders and non-responders.

However, the unique and the shared neuroanatomical characteristics of the two disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to compare the topological organization of gray matter networks between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid medication-naive SAD patients, and 41 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the three groups. The relationships between brain network measures and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Relative to healthy controls, both the MDD and the SAD patients showed global decreases in clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-worldness and locally decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the left insular, lingual, and calcarine cortices. Compared with healthy controls, the SAD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities and morphological connections mainly involving the prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network. Furthermore, compared to the SAD patients, the MDD patients showed increased characteristic path length, reduced global efficiency, and decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide new evidence for shared and specific similarity-based gray matter network alterations in MDD and SAD and emphasize that the psychopathological changes in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus might be different between the two disorders.

J	Duan, Lian; Feng, Qiudi; Xu, Pengfei								Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to Assess Brain Activation Evoked by Guilt and Shame								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						197	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00197			JUN 10 2020	2020	Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising brain imaging modality for studying the neural substrates of moral emotions. However, the feasibility of using fNIRS to measure moral emotions has not been established. In the present study, we used fNIRS to detect the brain activation evoked by two typical moral emotions-guilt and shame. We presented the participants with guilt and shame context to evoke emotional responses and measured the brain activity by using fNIRS. The univariate general linear model analysis showed significant activations for both emotions in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle temporal gyrus, and specific activation for guilt in the right temporoparietal junction. The multivariate classification analysis showed an overall recognition accuracy of 52.50%, which was significantly higher than the chance level in classifying the guilt, shame, and neutral emotions. These results suggested the feasibility of using fNIRS to assess the brain activation evoked by guilt and shame and demonstrated the potentials of fNIRS in studying the neural correlates of moral emotions.

The final analytic sample used for this study included 1,922 respondents who responded to both waves and who responded to questions concerning drinking and smoking behavior.Results: Using lagged dependent variable models, findings show that personal networks can have protective effects on smoking or drinking; more contact-days with alters lower odds of drinking (OR = 0.935,p< .01), and more alters in the same household lower odds of smoking (OR = 0.679,p< .05). Being able to discuss issues of health with others serves to reduce the adoption of smoking (OR = 0.555,p< .05). However, for current smokers and drinkers, personal networks are not necessarily protective from heavy smoking or drinking; more close ties increase odds of heavy drinking (OR = 1.531,p< .01), while networks have no significant associations with the odds of heavy smoking for current smokers.Conclusion: Context is important when evaluating the influence of social networks on health-compromising behaviors, as social networks can be protective from engaging in smoking/drinking behavior, but for those who currently smoke or drink, it has no relationship or can even be enabling for those who currently drink, making them more likely to be heavy drinkers.

Although the potential for health risks is well documented when it comes to performance enhancing drugs in sport, the health implications of cognitive enhancing drugs (CEDs) remain unclear.Objectives: This article aims to provide a foundational understanding about CEDs and their application in sport. It considers what little is known about the types, nature, impact, and implications of their use for athletes and sport policy.Method: A narrative literature review was undertaken to ascertain the emerging role of CEDs beyond their clinical use to treat prescribed disorders, including the limited studies in the sporting domain. This review also considered literature pertinent to the impact of CEDs in sport and the challenges for sport policy.Results: Given the prospects of negative health impacts, policy-makers interested in preventing and controlling the use of CEDs, as well as reducing harm to athletes at all levels of performance, need guidance. This article highlights multi-faceted concerns and shines a spotlight on key issues for sporting bodies to consider regarding the critical impact that widespread use and adoption of these substances might entail.Conclusion: While the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is seemingly awake to the threat posed, actions to circumvent the spread of CEDs throughout sport are nascent and require greater understanding and attention.

J	Kanoga, Suguru; Hoshino, Takayuki; Asoh, Hideki								Independent Low-Rank Matrix Analysis-Based Automatic Artifact Reduction Technique Applied to Three BCI Paradigms								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						173	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00173			JUN 9 2020	2020	Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can potentially enable people to non-invasively and directly communicate with others using brain activities. Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently contaminate EEGs.

Effect of Directional Deep Brain Stimulation on Sensory Thresholds in Parkinson's Disease								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						217	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00217			JUN 9 2020	2020	Objective Previous studies showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves pain symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) patients when programmed for motor-symptom relief. One factor involved in pain processing is sensory perception of stimuli. With the advent of directional leads, we explore whether directional DBS affects quantitative sensory testing (QST) metrics acutely. Methods PD patients with subthalamic (STN) DBS and directional leads were tested in 5 settings (DBS-OFF, DBS-ON with omnidirectional stimulation, and DBS-ON) for each of three directional segments of contact used for clinical programming. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) assessed patient's motor skills at time of study visit at clinical contact and at contact which produced optimal sensory threshold (defined by the greatest tolerance to mechanical stimuli). Correlation analyses were performed between stimulation parameters [amplitude, frequency, pulse width (PW), total electrical energy delivered (TEED)] and outcome metrics. Results Sensory thresholds were obtained in nine patients. Directional stimulation did not significantly alter patient perceptions of sensory stimulus [cold pain (p= 0.69), warm pain (p= 0.99), Von frey fibers (p= 0.09), pin-prick (p= 0.88), vibration (p= 0.40), pressure (p= 0.98)]. With correlation analysis, increasing PW at the posterior contact increased pin prick and vibration sensitivity (p< 0.001). Additionally, an increase in TEED caused a decrease in sensitivity to warm detection when using the anterior (p= 0.04), lateral (p= 0.02), and medial contacts (p= 0.03), and also caused a decrease in sensitivity to cold detection when using the medial contact (p= 0.03). UPDRS-III remained stable during testing. Conclusion Motor benefit can be acutely maintained at directional contacts, whereas directional stimulation can modulate thermal and mechanical sensitivity. Further investigation will determine whether these changes are maintained chronically or can be improved with optimized programming.

However, the significant interindividual differences among patients limit its application in clinical practice. Here, we applied and evaluated an individualized, frequency-based approach of HFO analysis in stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data for localizing the epileptogenic zones (EZs). Methods Clinical and SEEG data of 19 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. The individualized spectral power of all signals recorded by electrode array, i.e., the relative strength of HFO, was computed with a wavelet method for each patient. Subsequently, the clinical value of the relative strength of HFO for identifying the EZ was evaluated. Results Focal increase in the relative strength of HFO in SEEG recordings were identified in all 19 patients. HFOs identified inside the clinically identified seizure onset zone had more spectral power than those identified outside (p< 0.001), and HFOs in 250-500 Hz band (fast ripples) seemed to be more specific identifying the EZ than in those in 80-250 Hz band (ripples) (p< 0.01). The resection of brain regions generating HFOs resulted in a favorable seizure outcome in 17 patients (17/19; 89.5%), while in the cases of other patients with poor outcomes, the brain regions generating HFOs were not removed completely. Conclusion The relative strength of HFO, especially fast ripples, is a promising effective biomarker for identifying the EZ and can lead to a favorable seizure outcome if used to guide epilepsy surgery.

Participants completed the following instruments: socioeconomic questionnaire, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory.Results:Individuals with alcohol dependence alone, or comorbid with crack cocaine dependence, showed elevated levels of aggression and anger, though these varied according to the drug of abuse. Concurrent users of alcohol and crack cocaine had the highest levels of aggression, followed by isolated alcohol users, suggesting an association between alcohol consumption and aggression.Conclusion:The present findings suggest that alcohol and aggression levels may be associated with violent behavior. Concurrent use of alcohol and crack cocaine was related to higher levels of aggression, which may be associated with more severe alterations in behavior and impulse control.

This syndrome is debilitating and impedes rehabilitation. We carried out a clinical feasibility trial of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and a behavioural rehabilitation programme, alone or in combination, in patients with neglect. Patients >4 weeks post right hemisphere stroke were randomized to 10 sessions of tDCS, 10 sessions of a behavioural intervention, combined intervention, or a control task. Primary outcomes were recruitment and retention rates, with secondary outcomes effect sizes on measures of neglect and quality of life, assessed directly after the interventions, and at 6 months follow up. Of 288 confirmed stroke cases referred (representing 7% of confirmed strokes), we randomized 8% (0.6% of stroke cases overall). The largest number of exclusions (91/288 (34%)) were due to medical comorbidities that prevented patients from undergoing 10 intervention sessions. We recruited 24 patients over 29 months, with 87% completing immediate post-intervention and 67% 6 month evaluations. We established poor feasibility of a clinical trial requiring repeated hospital-based tDCS within a UK hospital healthcare setting, either with or without behavioural training, over a sustained time period. Future trials should consider intensity, duration and location of tDCS neglect interventions.

As deaths to illegally manufactured fentanyl have increased, attention to the role of prescribed opioids may be waning. However, the shifting nature of today's opioid epidemic demands we monitor how both legal and illegal drugs are involved in overdose deaths.Objectives:The purpose of our study is to investigate the prescription drug (Rx) records of overdose death decedents to illuminate the continued role of prescribed medications in Wave 3 deaths.Methods:We matched drug overdose death data and prescription drug monitoring data to investigate the prescription drug records (i.e. types of opioids and other medications) of Delaware, USA, decedents who died from a drug overdose death between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2015 (27 months).Results: Fentanyl decedents differed significantly from other decedents in prescribed medications, including the amount and proximity of opioid and Rx fentanyl prescriptions before death. These relationships held while controlling for demographic characteristics and contributing health conditions.Conclusions: Our findings show a continued presence of Rx opioids in overdose deaths and that those dying from fentanyl had different Rx records than those who died from other drugs. Continued monitoring of Rx drugs, improved toxicology testing and greater data access for more research should follow to inform effective interventions.

Although numerous studies have considered cognitive control to be domain-general, the shared and distinct brain responses to different types of incongruence or conflict remain unclear. Using a hybrid flanker task, the present study explored the temporal dynamics of brain activation to three types of incongruence: flanker interference, rule-based response switch (rule-switch), and action-based response switch (response-alternation). The results showed that: (1) all three types of incongruence evoked larger N2 amplitudes than the congruent condition in the frontal region, with the N2 amplitudes and topographical distribution of the N2 effect differing between the different types of incongruence; and (2) in the P300 time window, the flanker interference condition yielded the most delayed P300 latency, whereas the rule-switch and response-alternation conditions yielded smaller P300 amplitudes with a longer interval from P300 peak to a keypress. These findings suggest that different types of incongruence are first monitored similarly by the cognitive control system and then resolved differently.

However, investigations on age differences in hippocampal activation and functional connectivity and their contributions to the development of memory have yielded mixed results. Given the known structural and functional heterogeneity along the long axis of the hippocampus, we investigated age differences in the activation and functional connectivity in hippocampal subregions with a cross-sectional sample of 96 participants ages 8-25 years. We found that anterior and posterior hippocampus supported memory formation, and there was overall stability in memory-related hippocampal activation with age. Without taking account of memory outcome, direct contrast between subregions showed higher functional connectivity of anterior, compared to the posterior hippocampus, with regions in the inferior frontal and lateral temporal lobes, and higher functional connectivity of posterior, compared to the anterior hippocampus, with regions in the medial and superior frontal, inferior parietal, and occipital lobes. A direct contrast between the memory-related connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior hippocampus identified a region in the medial frontal cortex, with which anterior and posterior hippocampus was differentially functionally connected. Finally, we identified age differences in memory-related differential hippocampal functional connectivity with several frontal and visual/sensory cortices, underscoring the importance of examining age differences in the patterns of hippocampal connectivity. Moreover, the specific patterns of differential anterior and posterior functional connectivity indicate an increase in the functional specialization along the long axis of the hippocampus and a dynamic shift in hippocampal connectivity patterns that supports memory development.

J	Ylinen, Sari; Nora, Anni; Service, Elisabet								Better Phonological Short-Term Memory Is Linked to Improved Cortical Memory Representations for Word Forms and Better Word Learning								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						209	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00209			JUN 5 2020	2020	Language learning relies on both short-term and long-term memory. Phonological short-term memory (pSTM) is thought to play an important role in the learning of novel word forms. However, language learners may differ in their ability to maintain word representations in pSTM during interfering auditory input. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how pSTM capacity in better and poorer pSTM groups is linked to language learning and the maintenance of pseudowords in pSTM. In particular, MEG was recorded while participants maintained pseudowords in pSTM by covert speech rehearsal, and while these brain representations were probed by presenting auditory pseudowords with first or third syllables matching or mismatching the rehearsed item. A control condition included identical stimuli but no rehearsal. Differences in response strength between matching and mismatching syllables were interpreted as the phonological mapping negativity (PMN). While PMN for the first syllable was found in both groups, it was observed for the third syllable only in the group with better pSTM. This suggests that individuals with better pSTM maintained representations of trisyllabic pseudowords more accurately during interference than individuals with poorer pSTM. Importantly, the group with better pSTM learned words faster in a paired-associate word learning task, linking the PMN findings to language learning.

The Role of Moderating Variables on BOLD fMRI Response During Semantic Verbal Fluency and Finger Tapping in Active and Educated Healthy Seniors								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						203	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00203			JUN 5 2020	2020	Semantic verbal fluency is among the most employed tasks in cognitive aging research and substantial work is devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms behind age-related differences at the neural and behavioral levels. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the role of moderating variables, such as age, sex, MMSE, and proxies of cognitive reserve (CR) on the hemodynamic response evoked by semantic verbal fluency in healthy young and healthy older adults. So far, no study has been conducted to this end. To elucidate the exclusive effect of the mentioned variables on brain activation during semantic fluency, finger tapping was included as a control task. Results showed that disregarding adjustments for age, older adults displayed important parietal activations during semantic fluency as well as during finger-tapping. Specifically, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were areas activated in both tasks in the older group. Younger adults, only displayed parietal activations related to age and sex when these demographics were employed as predictors. Concerning proxies of CR in semantic fluency, the only vocabulary was an important moderator in both age groups. Higher vocabulary scores were associated with lesser activation in occipital areas. Education did not show significant correlations with brain activity during semantic fluency in any of the groups. However, both CR proxies were significantly correlated to brain activations of older adults during finger tapping. Specifically, vocabulary was associated with frontal regions, while education correlated with parietal lobe and cingulate gyrus. Finally, the effects of MMSE were mostly observed on brain activation of older adults in both tasks. These findings demonstrate that the effects of moderating variables on shaping brain activation are intricate and not exclusive of complex verbal tasks. Thus, before adjusting for "nuisance variables," their importance needs to be established. This is especially true for samples including older adults for whom a motor task may be a demanding operation due to normal age-related processes of dedifferentiation.

The Association Between Experimentally Induced Stress, Performance Monitoring, and Response Inhibition: An Event-Related Potential (ERP) Analysis								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						189	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00189			JUN 5 2020	2020	Psychological stress is increasingly associated with alterations in performance and affect. Yet, the relationship between experimentally induced psychological stress and neural indices of performance monitoring and error processing, as well as response inhibition, are unclear. Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we tested the relationship between experimental stress, using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and the error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and N2 ERP components. A final sample of 71 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to go through the TSST (n= 36; 18 female) or a brief mindfulness relaxation exercise (n= 35; 16 female) immediately followed by a go/no-go task while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure confirmed increased physiological stress in the TSST group relative to control. Reaction times, accuracy, and post-error slowing did not differ by stress group. Two-group (TSST, control) by 2-trial type (correct, incorrect for ERN/Pe; go correct, no-go correct for N2) repeated measures ANOVAs for the ERN, Pe, and N2 showed the expected main effects of trial type; neither the ERN nor the N2 ERP components showed interactions with the stress manipulation. In contrast, the Pe component showed a significant Group by Trial interaction, with reduced Pe amplitude following the stress condition relative to control. Pe amplitude did not, however, correlate with cortisol reactivity. Findings suggest a reduction in Pe amplitude following experimental stress that may be associated with reduced error awareness or attention to errors following the TSST. Given the variability in the extant literature on the relationship between experimentally induced stress and neurophysiological reflections of performance monitoring, we provide another point of data and conclude that better understanding of moderating variables is needed followed by high-powered replication studies to get at the nuance that is not yet understood in the relationship between induced stress and performance monitoring/response inhibition processes.

Purpose The aim of the study was to investigate interhemispheric interactions between PDD patients and patients with PD without depression (PDND). Methods The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) combined with the seed-based method was used to investigate intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 33 PDD patients, 60 PDND, and 47 healthy controls (HCs). Results PDD patients exhibited a decreased VMHC in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus and paracentral lobule (MFG/PCL) than did PDND patients. Parkinson's disease with depression had a decreased VMHC in the bilateral precentral gyrus than had PDND and HC (p< 0.05). Parkinson's disease with depression had a decreased homotopic RSFC from the medial frontal gyrus (MFG)/PCL to the contralateral supplementary motor area (SMA) than had PDND (p< 0.05). The decreased homotopic RSFC from the right MFG/PCL to the left SMA was negatively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores (p< 0.05), but not with illness duration, Beck's Depression Inventory, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in PD patients. Conclusions Our findings indicated that the occurrence of depression in Parkinson's disease is associated with the dysfunctional connectivity from the MFG/PCL to the contralateral SMA, which could be used as potential neuroimaging markers for the diagnosis of depression in PD patients.

By adopting a ToM Networks model, we investigated ToM performance, and brain imaging correlates in relapsing-remitting (RR) and progressive (Pr) MS. 16RR, 19Pr, and 21 healthy controls were assessed with both cognitive (CToM) and affective ToM (AToM) tests and neuropsychological tools and were evaluated with MRI. Cortical thickness, sub-cortical volumetry, and tract-based-spatial-statistics were analyzed. Our results reported a CToM deficit in Pr, correlated with attention. While no relation between gray matter and CToM was observed, a widespread correlation between CToM and normal-appearing white matter was found. In particular, we registered a significant positive correlation between CToM and fractional anisotropy in Superior and Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus and right thalamic radiation tracts. Moreover, an inverse correlation between CToM and mean diffusivity of the right fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, cortico-spinal, left uncinate, corpus callosum, and forceps minor tracts was also observed. This work highlighted a double disconnection mechanism in Pr MS affecting communication both (1) inside the ToM network and (2) between the ToM network and cognitive execution areas, likely explaining the deficit in cognitive ToM.

Two Mandarin-English bilingual patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia participated in this study via online conferencing system following a multiple-baseline design. Both of them completed a 10-week of Mandarin VNeST treatment, and were probed on verb retrieval ability in a sentence context in both languages. Response accuracy was analysed to investigate the treatment acquisition, within-language generalization, and cross-language generalization effects. Standardized language assessments in both languages were administered pre- and post-treatment to further examine generalization to other linguistic tasks. Error analysis was conducted to investigate the evolution of within- and cross-language errors. Both patients improved after training in Mandarin VNeST, and showed different patterns of within-language and cross-language generalizations. They also improved in a variety of standardized language tasks. Error analysis showed a decline in semantic errors over the course of treatment in both patients, with cross-linguistic errors showing a decrease during Mandarin probes and an increase during English probes in one of the patients. This study contributes to our current understanding of theories of bilingual verb processing, and provides treatment guidance in Mandarin-English bilinguals with aphasia.

Though much is known about the PPN region through animal studies, there are limited physiological recordings from ambulatory humans. The PPN has recently garnered interest as a potential deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for improving gait and freezing of gait (FoG) in PD. We used bidirectional neurostimulators to record from the human PPN region and GPi in a small cohort of severely affected PD subjects with FoG despite optimized dopaminergic medications. Five subjects, with confirmed on-dopaminergic medication FoG, were implanted with bilateral GPi and bilateral PPN region DBS electrodes. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained during various gait tasks for 5 months postoperatively in both the off- and on-medication conditions (obtained during the no stimulation condition). The results revealed suppression of low beta power in the GPi and a 1-8 Hz modulation in the PPN region which correlated with human gait. The PPN feature correlated with walking speed. GPi beta desynchronization and PPN low-frequency synchronization were observed as subjects progressed from rest to ambulatory tasks. Our findings add to our understanding of the neurophysiology underpinning gait and will likely contribute to the development of novel therapies for abnormal gait in PD.

The current study builds on prior research using latent class analysis (LCA) to examine heterogeneity in patterns of adolescent life events at baseline to HED over the course of three years (4 timepoints) as part of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA).Methods:Life event classes were modeled using LCA that characterized NCANDA participants based upon their responses to the Life Events Questionnaire (N = 467, age:M = 14.98,SD = 1.69, 49.7% female). These baseline latent life event classes were then compared to HED at baseline and years 1, 2 and 3 using multinomial logistic regression.Results:At baseline, the LCA characterized four classes of adolescents based on endorsement of life events: negative-relational conflict (n = 65, 13.9%), negative-financial problems (n = 49, 10.5%), low life events (n = 130, 27.8%), and positive life events (n = 223, 47.8%). Life event trajectories differed for the negative life event classes compared to the other two classes, with greater odds of HED in the negative-financial problems class at year 1.Conclusion:The four latent classes derived from the life events of NCANDA youth yielded a characterization of adolescents that could aid in understanding HED over the subsequent three years, suggesting that everyday life events may inform adolescent binge drinking.

We aimed to investigate the correlation between the WAIS-III metrics and whole-brain structures using magnetic resonance imaging. Methods The participants were 266 healthy, right-handed individuals (age: 45.6 +/- 12.9 years, 98 males and 168 females). IQs were evaluated using the WAIS-III and Japanese Adult Reading Test (JART). Voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging were performed to analyze the correlation of the WAIS-III metrics and JART score with the gray matter volume and white matter integrity, respectively. Results The verbal IQ significantly and positively correlated with the left gyrus rectus and anterior cingulate gyrus, left posterior insula and planum polare, and left superior and middle frontal gyri volumes (p< 0.05, corrected). The verbal comprehension group index significantly and positively correlated with the left superior and middle frontal gyri, left gyrus rectus and anterior cingulate gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus volumes, while the processing speed group index significantly and positively correlated with the bilateral various regional white matter fractional anisotropy values (p< 0.05, corrected). In contrast, the JART score showed no correlation with any brain structure. Conclusion These results suggested the neurostructural bases of the WAIS-III IQs and group indices in the brain of healthy individuals.

A Nexus Model of Restricted Interests in Autism Spectrum Disorder								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						212	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00212			JUN 3 2020	2020	Restricted interests (RIs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinically impairing interests of unusual focus or intensity. They are a subtype of restricted and repetitive behaviors which are one of two diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the near ubiquity of RIs in ASD, the neural basis for their development is not well understood. However, recent cognitive neuroscience findings from nonclinical samples and from individuals with ASD shed light on neural mechanisms that may explain the emergence of RIs. We propose the nexus model of RIs in ASD, a novel conceptualization of this symptom domain that suggests that RIs may reflect a co-opting of brain systems that typically serve to integrate complex attention, memory, semantic, and social communication functions during development. The nexus model of RIs hypothesizes that when social communicative development is compromised, brain functions typically located within the lateral surface of cortex may expand into social processing brain systems and alter cortical representations of various cognitive functions during development. These changes, in turn, promote the development of RIs as an alternative process mediated by these brain networks. The nexus model of RIs makes testable predictions about reciprocal relations between the impaired development of social communication and the emergence of RIs in ASD and suggests novel avenues for treatment development.

While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other's attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners' attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either "high eye contact" or "low eye contact" dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas. Together, findings suggest that variation in social behavior as measured by eye contact modulates activity in a subunit of the network associated with joint attention.

Understanding the hemispheric difference between DLPFC and ipsilateral motor cortex connection in the resting-state will provide fundamental knowledge to explain the different roles DLPFC plays in motor behavior. Purpose:The current study tested the interactions between the ipsilateral DLPFC and the primary motor cortex (M1) in each hemisphere at rest. We hypothesized that left DLPFC has a greater inhibitory effect on the ipsilateral M1 compared to the right DLPFC. Methods:Fourteen right-handed subjects were tested in a dual-coil paired-pulse paradigm using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The conditioning stimulus (CS) was applied to the DLPFC and the test stimulus (TS) was applied to M1. Interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between CS and TS were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ms. The result was expressed as a percentage of the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the unconditioned test pulse. Results:There was stronger inhibitory effect for the left compared to the right hemisphere at ISIs of 2 (p= 0.045), 10 (p= 0.006), 15 (p= 0.029) and 20 (p= 0.024) ms. There was no significant inhibition or facilitation at any ISI in the right hemisphere. Conclusions:The two hemispheres have distinct DLPFC and M1 cortico-cortical connectivity at rest. Left hemisphere DLPFC is dominant in inhibiting ipsilateral M1.

Spatial Perspective-Taking in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Predictive Role of Visuospatial and Motor Abilities								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						208	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00208			JUN 3 2020	2020	Despite its impact on everyday functioning, spatial perspective-taking has rarely been investigated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and previous findings are surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. In the present study, we aimed to investigate spatial perspective-taking abilities in children and adolescents with ASD without intellectual disabilities, comparing them with a group of typically developing (TD) peers. Our objectives were: (i) to test similarities and differences between these groups in a spatial perspective-taking task; and (ii) to see whether similar or different underlying processes (i.e., fine and gross motor skills, and visuospatial abilities) might account for the groups' performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. A group of children with ASD (N= 36) was compared with a TD group (N= 39), aged from 8 to 16 years. Participants were administered tasks assessing spatial perspective-taking, fine and gross motor skills, visuo-constructive abilities, visuospatial working memory, visual imagery, and mental rotation. Our results revealed that the ASD group had more difficulty with the spatial perspective-taking task than the TD group. The two groups also had some shared and some different processes that predicted their perspective-taking performance: a significant predictive effect of fine motor skills and visuospatial working memory emerged for both groups, while gross motor skills (i.e., walking heel-to-toe) and visuospatial imagery only revealed a role in the TD group. These findings suggest that different abilities might account for the two groups' performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. Gross motor skills and complex visuospatial abilities seem to be more important in sustaining spatial perspective-taking ability in typical development than in the event of ASD. Some of the clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.

Considering the limited efficacy of pharmacological treatments, the use of musical interventions as non-drug treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease are strongly recommended. Musical interventions seem to improve the socio-emotional and cognitive functioning of these patients, with benefits increasing when patients are engaged at the motor level. Objective. Our study evaluates the factors that may influence patients' socio-emotional and motor engagement during musical activities, and measures their sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) abilities. Methods. Each participant was asked to tap with a metronomic or a musical rhythm, in the presence of a musician who performed the task with them. The presence of the musician was real (live condition) or virtual (video condition). Two tempi were tested: a slow tempo (inter-onset interval of 800 ms) and a fast tempo (inter-onset interval of 667 ms). Results. Patients spontaneously produced more rhythmic movements in response to the music than to the metronome. However, the consistency and accuracy of sensorimotor synchronization were better with the metronome than with the music, and also better in video than in live condition. These effects were modulated by the tempo of the auditory sequences. Conclusion. These results confirm the importance of the musical context and social interactions on these different performances. By evaluating in parallel the hand sensorimotor synchronization, spontaneous motor and socio-emotional behaviors with quantitative and controlled measurements, this study validates a multimodal approach to evaluate the patients' engagement in a musical task. These initial results open up promising application prospects while providing clinicians and researchers a rigorous methodology for understanding the factors that are at the origin of the therapeutic benefits of musical activities on the behavior and well-being of patients and their caregivers.

To prevent the risk of falling, intervention programmes based on physical exercises focusing on balance appear to be the most efficient, which explains the multiplication of this type of action at the local level. However, these actions are very rarely evaluated. Methods. Our sample consists of 26 women (75.0 +/- 6.7 years old), randomly assigned to two groups: an intervention group (GI) that has benefited from a balance-oriented adapted physical activity (APA) program focused on balance and conducted in an associative structure; and a control group (GC). Our study aims to evaluate different parameters such as physical (functional mobility, balance), subjective (balanced confidence) and health (quality of life) indicators in women over 65 years of age, living independently at home. Results. In people completing the program, we observed an improvement in equilibrium capabilities (significant increase in POMA score; p < 0.05), in balance and functional mobility (significant decrease in TUG score; p < 0.01) and in balance confidence (significant increase in ABC-S; p < 0.05). Conclusion. The implementation of a short programme by the associative structure seems to be an interesting approach for the prevention of falls in autonomous elderly women.

However, this disorder could be insufficiently screened in this population. And the diagnosis could be difficult to make especially because of specificities of this population. The diagnosis is based on the criteria of the DSM-5. Nevertheless, DSM-5 criteria were elaborated for younger adults and some of them could be inappropriate for older adults. Methods : We studied the frequency of the DSM-5 criteria in a population of 59 patients aged around of 80 years, non-dependent and exposed to alcohol or benzodiazepines. We collected data relative to age, gender, type of residence (self-home or retirement house), medical past history, current treatment. Patient were also asked about their alcohol consumption, time of exposition, quantity of alcohol ingested or dose of benzodiazepines ingested and frequency of consumption. Alcohol consumption was reported as alcohol unit per day (one unit containing 10-gram alcohol). Frequency consisted in number of days with consumption in a week. Concerning benzodiazepine with evaluated the quantity by converting dose in equivalent diazepam per day. We determine the frequency of each criterion and the association with SUD diagnosis. Results : We found that 45% of patients presented a diagnosis of SUD. DSM criteria 1, 2, 4, 9, 10 and 11 were found significantly more frequently in patients with addiction than in those without addiction. On the regression analysis criteria 1, 4, 6, 9, 10 and 11 as well as the number of units of alcohol consumed per day were associated with the diagnosis of addiction. The other socio-demographic factors were not associated with the diagnosis. Conclusion : This pilot study highlights that certain DSM-5 addiction criteria seem to be more relevant to seek in the elderly.

The link between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 appears to be twofold. First, some reports of data indicate that certain groups of patients are more at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing cardiovascular conditions and older patients. In addition, these patients incur disproportionately worse outcome. Second, SARS-CoV2 infection can be complicated by life-threatening cardiovascular acute diseases. Despite the rapid evolution of data on this pandemic, this review aims to highlight the cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 whether as comorbidities including concerns and uncertainty regarding the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 or related to acute cardiovascular complications.

Although psychiatric disorders of older persons require a comprehensive, integrative and multidisciplinary approach, geriatrics and old age psychiatry mobile units often work in parallel without concertation for the management of complex pathologies. The aim of this paper is to present the organisation and the results of a out-of-hospital MGT with a geriatrician and old age psychiatrists (OAP) in a same unit. Method: Data were collected during the first-year (2018) of the out-of-hospital MGT of Tours University hospital. After initial geriatric assessment and when old age psychiatry (OAP) intervention was needed, referral mode and justification, patient's characteristics and recommendations made by the team were collected. Results: During the study period, 151 patientswere assessed, 53% (n=80) had out-of-medical follow-up or difficulties to access to healthcare; 40% (n=60) had behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), 30% (n=45) falls, 15%(n=23) social problems, 10%(n=15) alteration of overall health status and 5% (n=7) drug conciliation; 40% (n=60) benefited from an OAP evaluation; 100% (n=60) had out of medical follow-up, 83% (n=50) had severe BPSD, 17% (n=10) psychological symptom with psychiatric condition, 10% (n=6) misused psychotropic medications in charge of general comorbidities decompensation; 32% (n=19) had geriatric, OAP consultations and 33% (n=20) were in denial of care; 23% (n=14) with severe BPSD had a second OAP consultation. Discussion: Relationship between geriatrician and OAP in the same MGT enables to deliver comprehensive care, including organic, psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities and collaborative assessment of iatrogenicity. A strengthened relationship with general practitioners is a possible option for these frail older patients, out-of-medical follow-up allowing their reintegration in the geriatric healthcare system.

There are two distinct groups of patients in which therapeutic issues are different. On the one hand, old to very old patients in which PD started at a late age above 80. These patients present with a more severe PD with earlier onsets of cognitive defects and dopa-resistant axial signs, and more comorbidities needing to be taken into account while treating them. Because of their limited life expectancy, these patients would not likely need second line treatments over their disease course. On the other hand, patients presenting with advanced PD, in which fluctuations and dyskinesia induced by dopamine replacement therapy and dopa-resistant axial symptoms impede patient's daily life. These patients are often treated with multiple antiparkinsonian medications, sometimes at high doses. Some patients will also be treated with advanced therapies such as continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, continuous levodopacarbidopa intestinal gel or, more rarely, even subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulations. Because of the specificities of the old to very old parkinsonian patients, tolerance and efficacy of these treatments can be decreased. What is at stake is to aim for the best motor state possible while limiting iatrogenic adverse events. New emerging, potentially less invasive, techniques, such as gamma knife thalamotomy or high-intensity focused ultrasound thalamotomy or sub-thalamotomy, are also discussed here.

In older individuals with a mild cognitive impairment, deficits in working memory are frequent and can precede those of episodic memory, in addition to having a strong prognostic value of evolution toward a dementia of Alzheimer type. Because of its implication in numerous cognitive and cognitive-motor tasks, working memory is called upon in a wide range of daily life activities. Impairment in working memory therefore increases the risk of a loss of autonomy. In the current review, we present different working memory training programs. We show how these training programs are associated with specific effects and to near and far transfers towards other cognitive functions in older adults without cognitive impairment or with mild cognitive impairment, as well as in patients with dementia. We show that the benefits are confirmed by neuronal modifications, suggesting an improvement in the neuronal efficiency of the targeted or related trained processes. Finally, we consider the central question of the generalization of the cognitive gains of working memory training toward ecological situations.

An observational descriptive study was conducted in 25 nursing homes over a period of 2 weeks over periods of two weeks between 2016 and 2017. It aimed to describe the types of care-related adverse event, and to assess their seriousness, frequency of occurrence, and criticality. Eighty-six types of care-related adverse event belonging to 13 risk domains were identified (31 by the investigating physician). Among these types of event, 11 corresponded to an unacceptable level of criticality, and 13 were categorised as warranting surveillance. Efforts in nursing homes should focus on the various types of care-related adverse event: loss of or damage to a medical device; failure to administer a medication; failure to coordinate between structures; shortfalls in planning and care continuity; shortfalls in the information system; loss of or damage to laundry items; unplanned escapade. Recommendations on the main lines of prevention and improvement in nursing homes should be the subject of future study.

Seven major difficulties were identified: the isolation induced by the prohibition of visits, the lack of protective equipment and tests, the difficulties of people with cognitive difficulties in understanding measures to avoid the spread of the epidemic, the sustainability of overwork for professionals, the concern of the families of residents, complex situations at home and difficulties in accessing care. Four initiatives are being implemented: information and training for teams, compensation for interrupted visits, consultations and exchanges between professionals, actions to benefit people living at home. The Covid-19 epidemic hit the elderly sector at a very special moment in its history, several years of effort by the sector to reinvent itself around strong values. They have been a resource during this period of crisis. An ambitious law on old age and autonomy therefore appears to be a necessity.

From March 17 to March 27, 2020, the monitoring unit of the French society of geriatrics and gerontology decided to conduct a survey to analyze the implementation of the mobilization of geriatric units, given that this epidemic had shown that it resulted in excess mortality mainly among the elderly. The survey was able to bring together the response of 34 services, nine of which were located in a high epidemic cluster zone. Dedicated acute geriatric units for patients infected with COVID-19 were present in eight facilities, only outside the cluster zones. Nine geriatric follow-up and rehabilitation services were dedicated, an additional telemedicine activity concerned 35% of the facilities, and family listening and tablet communication facilities concerned 36% of the facilities. This survey is a snapshot of an initial moment in the epidemic. It provides an opportunity to describe the context in which this epidemic occurred in terms of geriatric policy, and to assess the responsiveness and inventiveness of these services in meeting the needs of the elderly.

Its homeostasis is dependent on dietary intake and its predominant renal elimination. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates its elimination. Acute and chronic hyperkalemia is a risk factor for cardiac mortality. Chronic renal failure and heart failure are the major comorbidities. RAAS inhibitor therapies are the major iatrogenic factors in hyperkalemia. Approximately 90% of patients with hyperkalemia are over 50 years of age and 43% are over 75 years of age. Only 4.9% of hyperkalemias are managed with resin therapy. One-third of patients have 3 comorbidities, and 14% have 5 or more comorbidities. The main comorbidities are hypertension (74.0%), dyslipidemia (56.3%), renal failure (55.2%), diabetes (44.7%), coronary artery disease such as angina and myocardial infarction (23.3%) and heart failure (12%). It should be noted that 2/3 of the patients receiving resins were also receiving ARBSIs and tended to have more co-morbidities. Hyperkalemia is underestimated and requires strict monitoring in patients with renal failure or heart failure. Resins are not suitable for long-term adherence and new therapies such as patiromer would reduce the risk of hyperkalemia.

Asymmetries of reading eye movements in simulated central vision loss								VISION RESEARCH				171				1	10		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.006			JUN 2020	2020	Patients with central vision loss are forced to use an eccentric retinal location as a substitute for the fovea, called a preferred retinal locus, or PRL. Clinical studies have shown that patients habitually choose a PRL located either to the left, and/or below the scotoma in the visual field. The position to the right of the scotoma is almost never chosen, even though this would be theoretically more suitable for reading, since the scotoma no longer blocks the upcoming text. In the current study, we tested whether this asymmetry may have an oculomotor basis. Six normally sighted subjects viewed page-like text with a simulated scotoma, identifying embedded numbers in "words" comprising random letters. Subjects trained and tested with three different artificial PRL ("pseudo-PRL," or pPRL) locations: inferior, to the right, or to the left of the scotoma. After several training blocks for each pPRL position, subjects were found to produce reliable oculomotor control. Both reading speed and eye movement characteristics reproduced observations from traditional paradigms such as page-mode reading and RSVP for an advantage for an inferior pPRL. While left and right positions resulted in similar reading speeds, we observed that a right pPRL caused excessively large saccades and more direction switches, exhibiting a zig-zag pattern that developed spontaneously. Thus, we propose that patients' typical avoidance of pPRL positions to the right of their scotoma could have an oculomotor component the erratic eye motion might potentially negate the perceptual benefit that this pPRL would offer.

It is known that peripheral vision is used to detect these changes and that saccades impair detection performance. However, comparatively little is known about the role of smooth-pursuit eye-movements (SPEMs) during these tasks. Therefore, we compared peripheral motion-change detection during SPEM and fixation at eccentricities up to 18 degrees, simulating the perceptual demands of real-life situations. Based on expert gaze behavior in sports, we predicted that motion detection should be better during fixation than SPEM. In a series of three experiments, we consistently found that detection rates and response times were impaired during SPEM compared to fixation, particularly at 18 degrees eccentricity. With an invisible pursuit object and targets moving ahead rather than behind the pursued object, performance differences in response times declined, whereas differences in detection rates interestingly remained unmoved. We argue that retinal image motion and attentional demands are reasons for SPEM impairments.

VISION RESEARCH				171				36	45		10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.008			JUN 2020	2020	The function of color in the processing of emotional scenes is not entirely clear. While there are studies showing that color matters in terms of the capture of covert attention by emotional stimuli, the impact of color on fixation patterns, reflecting overt attention, is unresolved. Studies on the role of color in evoking emotional response have also produced mixed results. Here, we aimed to explore how image color and content influence pupillary response and the engagement of overt visual attention. In the first experiment, we examined the pupillary reaction to neutral images (intact and phase scrambled) in three color variants (natural, abnormal, and grayscale). In the second experiment, we investigated the pupillary changes and fixation pattern in response to images of different valence (neutral, positive, and negative), again in three color versions. The results showed that pupillary responses were influenced by both content and the color of the images. The pupillary response to phase-scrambled images did not differ between the color versions. Intact neutral and positive images, but not negative ones, evoked smaller pupil responses if they were presented in abnormal colors rather than natural ones. The initial capture of attention by emotional content depended on the color version, whereas holding of attention was affected solely by the emotional valence. Thus, color changes the physiological response to images, particularly low-arousing ones, and modulates the initial engagement of attention by image content.

J	Bergmann, Nils; Tuennermann, Jan; Schuboe, Anna								Reward-predicting distractor orientations support contextual cueing: Persistent effects in homogeneous distractor contexts								VISION RESEARCH				171				53	63		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.010			JUN 2020	2020	Recent work on contextual cueing has shown that reward can facilitate context learning, e.g., when salient but task-irrelevant context features signal reward magnitude. Whether task-relevant context features yield a similar facilitating effect is unclear. Also, emergence and persistence of context learning for contexts associated with different reward magnitudes remains unclear. The present study investigated whether reward increases the speed with which context learning emerges, resulting in an earlier but asymptotically similar contextual cueing effect, or whether reward persistently increases context learning, visible as a larger contextual cueing effect on an asymptotical level. Reward was associated to the predominant orientation of the L-distractors, and the number of context repetitions was increased considerably. Results showed contextual cueing, i.e., faster responses and fewer fixations in repeated compared to novel contexts for all reward magnitudes. Moreover, a high reward led to a more pronounced contextual cueing effect. We developed a model-based approach to explicitly assess the non-linear decline and asymptotic level of the response time curves and to quantify how they were altered by reward. A hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation revealed that reward decreased the asymptotic level of the repeated contexts' response times. Our results therefore show that reward leads to a persistent advantage in contextual cueing rather than to earlier but asymptotically similar context learning.

Interestingly, an illusory visual completion often occurs at the joint where the stone base and the post join. Thus, even though the wooden post stands on the top surface of the stone base, observers tend to perceive the post as embedded in the stone base. In Experiment 1, photographs of real stone bases and wooden posts were presented, and the results showed that the more uneven the stone base was, the more the post was judged as embedded in the stone base. In Experiment 2, 3D graphic models with a similar size and color were presented, and the results again showed that the unevenness of the stone base influenced the perceptual embedment of the post. The results are discussed in relation to several potential hypotheses, including figural goodness, edge similarity, and physical knowledge.

J	Treleaven, Allison Jean; Yu, Deyue								Training peripheral vision to read: Reducing crowding through an adaptive training method								VISION RESEARCH				171				84	94		10.1016/j.visres.2018.05.009			JUN 2020	2020	Reading is slow and difficult for people with central vision loss who must rely on their peripheral vision. It has been shown that practicing on a letter-recognition task can increase peripheral reading speed, and that the training-related improvement is attributable mainly to reduced crowding. Since there is a high degree of variability in the vision conditions across people with central vision loss, a one-size-fits-all training protocol may not be adequate or appropriate for these patients. In this study, we target two aspects of training-training task and individual customization, and propose a training paradigm that focuses on reducing crowding and tailors training for each individual using an adaptive method. Seven normally-sighted adults were trained with four daily sessions of identifying crowded letters presented at various positions 10 degrees below fixation in a pre/post design. During the training, a dynamic cue (jitter motion) was applied to target letters to modulate crowding. Amplitude of motion was varied on a block by block basis according to individual performance to maintain task difficulty near a pre-defined level (80% accuracy in letter recognition). We found that motion amplitude gradually reduced as training progressed, indicating a reduction in crowding. Following training, reading speed (measured using RSVP method) showed a significant improvement in both the trained (49%) and untrained (50%) visual fields. Despite showing similar improvement as observed in the previous training studies, our adaptive training method demands less effort and, most importantly, offers customization for each individual trainee.

Some specialized vertebrate species have colonized these ecological habitats by living buried in the sand. Among these so called psammophilic species are the Scincidae sand dune living species Scincus scincus and Eumeces schneideri. These two skinks share a relatively similar behavioral ecology by living buried in sand, almost all the time for S. scincus and at least for some part of the day for E. schneideri. The visual system of these two lizards was investigated by histological, immunohistochemical, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and morphometric techniques. Both skink species exhibit a retina lacking fovea, composed predominantly of cones presenting two types of oil droplets (pale bluegreen and colorless). Both species possess a subset of rod like-photoreceptors (about 1 rod for 30 cones) evidenced by anti-rhodopsin immunoreactivity. A ratio 1:1-1:2 between ganglion cells and photoreceptors points to a linear connection (photoreceptors/bipolar neurons/ganglion cells) in the retina and indicates that both skinks more likely possess good visual acuity, even in the peripheral retina. The MRI analysis revealed differences between the species concerning the eye structures, with a more spherical eye shape for S. scincus, as well as a more flattened lens. The relative lens diameter of both species seems to correspond to a rather photopic pattern. Beside the fact that S. scincus and E. schneideri have different lifestyles, their visual capacities seem similar, and, generally speaking, these two psammophilic species theoretically exhibit visual capacities not far away from non-fossorial species.

Moderating effects of visual attention and action video game play on perceptual learning with the texture discrimination task								VISION RESEARCH				171				64	72		10.1016/j.visres.2020.02.003			JUN 2020	2020	There is currently substantial controversy regarding the reliability of observed patterns of perceptual learning. Contributing to this controversy are a lack of accounting for individual differences and how variations in training can give rise to different patterns of learning. Here we sought to investigate the impact of individual differences in attention, as measured with the Useful Field of View (UFOV) task, and action video game use on perceptual learning in a large sample of subjects trained on a Texture Discrimination Task (TDT). We examined baseline performance on the TDT, learning on the initially trained TDT stimuli and transfer to a subsequently trained background orientation. We find that participants showing better performance on the UFOV task performed better on the TDT, and also showed greater learning and transfer to an untrained background orientation. On the other hand, self-report of action video game play only inconsistently related performance, learning or transfer on the TDT. Further, we failed to replicate previous findings that training with different backgrounds gives rise to interference on the TDT. Together these results suggest that, while differences between individuals and differences in task structure play a role in perceptual learning, previous findings on the impact of action video game use and interference between training stimuli in perceptual learning may be idiosyncratic.

We developed a generally useful new composite stereodepth or CSD score, with range 0 to 20, that combines stereoacuity (from 0 to 13.3) and percent correct (13.3 to 20) into a single index. CSD allows differences in stereodepth performance to be measured across groups when thresholds cannot be reliably measured, and across time when individuals gain stereodepth perception during training. We used CSD scores to assess the benefit of unequal (mixed) left- and right-eye contrast during dichoptic stereoacuity training in people with amblyopia. Nineteen adult participants with anisometropic amblyopia were assigned randomly to 10 sessions of either mixed-contrast or fixed-contrast training. Stimuli were rectangles, one above the other, viewed through a four-mirror stereoscope. Participants indicated which rectangle appeared closer. A staircase controlled disparity within the stimulus. CSD improvement was better by 1.6 CSD units for participants who received mixed-contrast training. Thus, mixed-contrast stereo training was more effective than fixed-contrast training in adults with anisometropic amblyopia.

Indeed, adapting to a dense dot-texture reduces the apparent separation of subsequently presented dots pairs. Whether this metric is purely visual or shared between senses is still unknown. Here we present a new cross-modal after-effect revealing that the metric with which the visual system computes the relative spatial position of objects is shared with the motor system. A few seconds of mid-air self-produced tapping movements (adaptation) yielded a robust compression of the apparent separation of dot pairs subsequently displayed around the tapping region. This visuo-motor spatial metric could reflect an efficient functional architecture to program and execute actions aimed at efficient interaction with the objects in the environment.

Its popularity dates back to ancient times in the South-Asian community with a foundation based on four factors, i.e. social acceptability, religious beliefs, perceived health benefits and addiction. We aim to provide an overview of its use in the South Asian region.Methods: We performed an electronic search on Medline, Embase and Google Scholar to identify the origins of the various betel quid and areca nut practices pertaining to the South Asian region along with their social and cultural influences. We also studied the prevalence across the region and the health effects, especially carcinogenic, along with the impact of diverse immigration today.Results: Other than the debate of where it originates, there is a diverse plethora of terms and methods of use of areca nut and betel quid in the region. Although established as a known carcinogen, the incidence is high, especially in the Indian subcontinent, with very few studies focusing on its use alone (without tobacco). The effect of globalization and increased movement of Asians across borders is resulting in changes in the patterns of diseases as well due to wider dissemination of areca nut and betel quid use.Conclusions: There is a huge loss of lives due to the addiction that areca nut causes. Governments need to tightly regulate the laws and set up tailored programs to tackle this specific issue in this region.

It was historically limited to Asia-pacific region, but with the advent of globalization, it has become an equally challenging public health problem across the globe. Previously published literature can give us valuable insights in terms of historical interest and understanding related to betel nut. With the expansion of biomedical research a huge number of articles have been published on the same. In terms of understanding the impact of an article, citations are considered a proxy estimate measure. Thus we decided to analyze the top 100 cited articles (till November 2018) related to betel nut. The search in Google scholar database was done with the help of freely available software, Publish or Perish.Results:Overall we found that most articles were published from the fields of dentistry and oncology, with relatively minimal contribution from the field of Addiction Psychiatry. Hence, most articles have addressed the issue of epidemiology and mechanism with lesser share of treatment related publications. Various important information related to these articles have been discussed including the institutions, countries, journals and impactful authors in the field.

J	Hu, Yina; Zhong, Rui; Li, Hongyan; Zou, Yanhui								Effects of Betel Quid, Smoking and Alcohol on Oral Cancer Risk: A Case-Control Study in Hunan Province, China								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	9			1501	1508		10.1080/10826084.2020.1750031			JUN 1 2020	2020	Background: The high prevalence of betel quid chewing is associated with a serious burden of oral diseases. However, there is limitertd research on the effects of betel quid, smoking, and alcohol on oral cancer in the Hunan province, China.Objectives: We investigated the relationship between oral cancer and betel quid chewing, smoking, and alcohol consumption in the betel quid endemic area of Hunan province.Methods: A paired case-control study from January 2014 to September 2015 was conducted in the Hunan province, China. We recruited 304 oral cancer patients and 304 controls as subjects, and both groups were treated in the same provincial cancer hospital. Control subjects and cancer patients were matched by sex, age (3-year groups), education level, and residential district. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between oral cancer and betel quid, smoking, and alcohol consumption.Results: A significantly increased risk of oral cancer was associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel quid chewing (odds ratio [OR] of 1.49, 1.56, and 5.80, respectively;p < .05). The risk of cancer was significantly elevated at high levels of intake and prolonged duration of consumption of betel quid, smoking, and alcohol. After adjusting for confounders, betel quid chewers were found to have almost 5 times increased risk for oral cancer (OR = 5.41, 95% confidence interval: 3.32-8.80,p < .001).Conclusions: There was a positive correlation between betel quid chewing and risk of oral cancer in the Hunan Province.

There is a need to improve knowledge about the harmful effects of betel quid and areca nut chewing and train health care professionals to provide preventive interventions.Objectives:To introduce and evaluate the Pacific Open Learning Health Net (POLHN) online courses about the dangers of betel quid and areca nut.Methods:Two self-paced courses about betel quid and areca nut chewing were developed and offered via the POLHN which predominantly engages health professional working in the Pacific islands. Students completing each of the courses were asked to complete a survey measuring course organization, content, length and comprehension level, evaluation methods, adaption to the Pacific island context, relevance to work and level of interaction.Conclusions:The POLHN courses about the dangers of betel quid and areca nut were well accepted by participants for quality and relevancy to their work. POLHN is the first platform that offers a course in betel quid and areca nut in the Pacific and has the potential to be adopted elsewhere.

However, most studies have focused on students from middle-class families, with few investigations conducted on substance use by students from low-income families.Objective:To examine the associations between work experience and betel nut, alcohol, or tobacco (BAT) use among Taiwanese students from low-income families.Methods:The data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the fourth wave of the Taiwan Panel Study of Children and Youth survey which provides primary data on low-income families. A total of 3,350 low-income students aged 12-25 years old from middle school to university participated. The chi(2)test was performed to examine differences in sociodemographic characteristics and BAT use between employed and unemployed students. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the associations between work status, work intensity, monthly income, occupation, and BAT use.Results:Employed students displayed higher BAT use than those who were unemployed. Increased BAT use was also associated with higher work intensity (except for betel nut use), higher monthly income, and specific occupations (such as service or manual work).Conclusions:Employment is independently associated with a higher risk of BAT use among low-income Taiwanese students. Work intensity and specific occupational fields may offer insights into formulating relevant preventive measures for these students.

Despite the significant health risks associated with betel nut chewing, few interventions have been undertaken to reduce its harm.Objectives:To investigate betel nut use in Vanuatu and to identify opportunities to reduce its harm and possible interventions, framing the responses using the World Health Organization's MPOWER tobacco control model.Method:Qualitative research design, in the form of semi-structured interviews with ten participants with expertise in health, agriculture, education or non-communicable disease in Port Vila, Vanuatu during June 2017. Recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and a general inductive approach was used to identify key themes.Results:Participants reported a recent increase in betel nut use in Vanuatu due to the influence from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. To reduce the harm of betel nut use in Vanuatu, participants suggested policies and strategies that aligned with the MPOWER framework that could be adopted for betel nut control, including restricting cultivation and sale of betel nut in Vanuatu and using radio and existing community networks to reach people with messages about the dangers of betel nut use.Conclusion:Betel nut use may be growing in popularity in Vanuatu, where there are potential policy options to minimize harm. The MPOWER model for tobacco control may be a useful framework to help the Vanuatu government to deliver a comprehensive approach to reducing harm from betel nut use.

Reasons for Initiation of Areca Nut and Related Products in Patients with Oral Submucous Fibrosis within an Endemic Area in Gujarat, India								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	9			1413	1421		10.1080/10826084.2019.1660678			JUN 1 2020	2020	Background: While the patterns of consumption of areca nut and its by-products (ANBP) vary across South Asia and the rest of the world, all users share the probable severe outcome of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), and this is well reported. The role of psychosocial drivers of habit initiation and addiction is reported less.Objective: To reveal the burden of ANBP abuse, exploring the psychosocial relationship between sex, age at first exposure (AFE), the reason for initiation (RFI) with the type of habit (TOH).Methodology: Data came from the prospective hospital-based study conducted at K.M. Shah Dental College and Hospital covering years 2017 and 2018. Patients with oral lesions were assessed with complete history recording demographics, TOH, AFE, RFI, duration of habit, and clinical diagnosis of any oral and systemic diseases. Patients with a history of scleroderma, facial burns, and oral malignancy were excluded.Results: Of the 13,874 patients, 9.89% reported ANBP. We included 1000 OSMF patients. The mean age of the study cohort was 38.97 +/- 14.29 years, with a range of 17-75 years. Males constituted the majority (80.1%). The most common TOH reported was regular use of gutkha (60.1%) followed by mawa (31.4%) with tension and stress (30.3%) being the most common RFI among the cohort. TOH was notably different in relation to AFE. Interestingly, mawa chewing (38.69%) was observed more in females.Importance: This study reveals the burden of ANBP abuse and reports the complex psychosocial relationships between sex, AFE, and RFI with TOH in OSMF patients in this high incidence population.

The objective of this paper was to determine the prevalence and explore the correlates of current betel quid use in Bhutan.Materials and methods:This is a retrospective study of secondary data from the National Health Survey 2012 (NHS 2012) of Bhutan. The outcome variable of interest was current betel quid use. The self-reported demographic characteristics were obtained using a questionnaire developed following the WHO STEPwise approach to the surveillance of non-communicable diseases (STEP). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify correlates for betel quid use.Results:The prevalence of current betel quid use in this study was 45.0%. The correlates associated with current betel quid use were: being female; having a primary, high school or a monastic education; being professionals in the armed forces, managers, technicians, service and sales workers, and machine operators; being current smokers; alcohol consumption; and intake of drugs. Correlates associated with decreased betel quid use were: having a diploma/certificate-level and non-formal education, and living in urban areas.Conclusion:The findings indicate that betel quid was consumed by nearly half of the Bhutanese population. Bhutan should immediately initiate national prevention programs targeting these correlates of betel quid use.

Betel leaf acts as a carrier for areca nut and most often, smokeless tobacco, both of which are carcinogenic, making betel quid a harmful product.Objectives:The first objective was to compare the prevalence of "use of betel quid with tobacco" from GATS-1 to GATS-2. The second was to study the association of "use of betel quid with and without tobacco" with different socio-economic groups (wealth quintiles) according to select background characteristics.Methods:This study used data from the Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS), 2009-10 and 2016-17. Logistic regression with adjustment of co-variates (age, gender, residence and education) was used to study association of use of betel quid with different socio-economic groups.Results:Highest reduction (40 percent) was seen in "use of betel quid with tobacco" among male youth (15-24 years) over the two rounds of GATS. No change was seen in this form of use among females. The odds of "use of betel quid with tobacco" had a positive gradient with decreasing wealth quintiles. "Use of betel quid without tobacco" showed highest odds among participants with moderate levels of education.Conclusion:Health promotion interventions around harmful effects of "betel quid with and without tobacco" are needed for all genders from poorer populations with low education. Stress needs to be laid on universal population-level public health awareness campaigns about the carcinogenic properties of areca nut in betel quid.

Altered Fluorescence of Buccal Cells as a Candidate Biomarker for Areca Nut Chewing								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	9			1450	1456		10.1080/10826084.2019.1683201			JUN 1 2020	2020	Background: Betel nut is used by an estimated 600 million people globally and is the 4th most widely used psychoactive substance in the world. Its use has been shown to cause oral and esophageal cancers. Therefore, cessation programs are needed in which an effective biomarker can be employed.Objectives: Buccal cells are highly exposed to the betel nut during its use and are also easy to collect. However, it is unknown if there are significant changes to these cells upon exposure or how long any changes may last as the turnover of buccal cells is relatively fast. We sought to determine if optical changes could be detected on buccal cells after exposure to betel nut and if detected, how long these changes were sustained.Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to determine whether fluorescence intensities differ between buccal cells exposed to betel nut and naive cells. We further characterized the optical signature of buccal cells exposed to betel nut and other polyphenol-rich substances using lambda scans performed on a laser scanning confocal microscope.Results: We demonstrate that the fluorescence of betel nut exposed cells is greater than that of cells exposed to other optically active compounds such as polyphenol-rich foods. We also demonstrate that the fluorescence spectra of betel nut quid exposed cells are distinct from that of cells exposed to other polyphenol-rich substances.Conclusions: We conclude that detecting the altered fluorescence of buccal cells following exposure to betel nut quid may serve as a candidate biomarker for betel nut quid use.

There are approximately 600 million AN/BQ users globally; the majority of users live in the Asia-Pacific region which, correspondingly, has the highest rates of oral cancer. Despite significant disease burden associated with AN/BQ use, there have been no systematic reviews of interventions to reduce product use.Objectives: To analyze interventions that prevent use of AN/BQ, present a basis for a future systematic review on the topic, and provide decision makers with examples of strategies that have demonstrated reduced AN/BQ use.Methods: To identify publications, we searched the literature using terms for AN/BQ and related synonyms in three databases: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Interventions that prevent AN/BQ use, that are published in English and that provide original data analysis, were included in this review. Interventions focused primarily on disease outcomes e.g. oral cancers (secondary prevention) were excluded.Results: Our search revealed 21 interventions targeting AN/BQ use between 1990 and 2018. Strategies include product bans, media campaigns, education, cessation, and taxation at individual and population levels, with varying evidence of impact. While these studies yielded some novel and promising findings, particularly regarding the impact of product bans, mass media campaigns, and cessation interventions, research on interventions specific to AN/BQ use remains limited.Conclusions: We have assessed published interventions that reduce AN/BQ use and identified future research priorities. These findings can be used to develop evidence-based interventions and help guide policymakers in implementing evidence-based policy to regulate these products.

People with betel quid chewing or cigarette smoking habits are often reluctant to attend screenings. Given that use of both substances is associated with certain occupations, a targeted approach should be applied to improve the effectiveness of screening programs.Objectives:This study sought to identify occupations with a high prevalence of betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking and to investigate their changing trends using the Taiwan National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) database.Methods:The NHIS database for 2009 and 2013 were used. We estimated prevalence of current betel quid and/or cigarette use among those aged 20-64 years old. Occupations were classified using the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88). Statistical analyses included indirect standardized rates and cluster analysis of chewing/smoking habits.Results:Drivers, mobile-plant operators, and extraction and building trades workers had the highest prevalence of betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking (chewing: 30.92% and 29.62%; smoking: 61.16% and 62.22%). Many occupations had large indirect standardized rates for chewing but not smoking. Both habits are associated with each other (r = 0.81,p < 0.001). Use appeared to decrease based on comparison between 2009 and 2013.Conclusions:Drivers and construction laborers showed high prevalence of betel chewing and cigarette smoking. The chewing habit is actually more prevalent in several sub-occupations. The survey results also revealed lower attendance by construction laborers at oral cancer screenings. Oral cancer screening and awareness should be emphasized in the identified occupations.

AN cessation programs are the most effective approach to reduce AN chewing induced cancers but require biomarkers to determine program compliance and success.Objectives:To explore chemical markers for short- and long-term AN exposure using non-invasively collected saliva, buccal cells (BCs), and scalp hair of chewers.Methods:Saliva was collected from a male chewer before and up to 2 days after AN chewing. Saliva was separated into supernatant and pellet (BCs) then analyzed by spectrophotometry and liquid chromatography (LC) with UV/VIS detection. Scalp hair was collected from four chewers and analyzed for areca alkaloids using direct analysis in real time-tandem mass spectrometry (DART-MSMS).Results:The red pigmented saliva after chewing showed no valuable signals when either the saliva supernatant or pellet (BCs) were analyzed by spectrophotometry. Saliva analysis by LC-UV/VIS showed diagnostically valuable signals at 488 nm up to 5 and 24 h post chewing in the supernatant and pellet, respectively. DART-MSMS analysis detected two of the four AN specific alkaloids (arecoline and arecaidine) in male but none in female hair.Conclusions/Importance:LC-UV/VIS analysis of the red pigments extracted from saliva and BCs after AN chewing showed distinct signals up to 24 h post chewing while DART-MSMS analysis in BCs and scalp hair showed selective signals of AN alkaloids for several weeks or months after AN exposure. Chemical hair treatment might prevent detection of areca alkaloids in hair. AN cessation trials and other programs now have essential tools for bioverification.

These practices are endemic in larger parts of South and Southeast Asia and selected Western Pacific countries. The prevalence of these habits varies across regions, age, gender, cultural practice, and socioeconomic status groups. Considerable variations exist between countries with respect to prevention/intervention programs, and policy guidelines of BQ usage.Objectives:(1) To provide an overview of the BQ chewing prevalence, practices, preventive interventions and policies in selected Asian and Western Pacific countries. (2) To explore the different terminologies associated with BQ use.Method:A narrative review of the current literature related to BQ, AN, and oral cancer was conducted by searching PUBMED, CINAHL, and GOOGLE databases.Results:The literature review revealed that the prevalence of BQ was found to be highest in Papua New Guinea, followed by Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. While, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan had comparatively lower prevalence. Smokeless tobacco, BQ with tobacco, BQ without tobacco, AN were some of the terminologies used for BQ in various studies.Conclusions:The prevalence, and the interventional policies related to BQ and AN chewing habits varies widely among the selected countries. With the increasing awareness and association of BQ with oral cancer, there is a need to have better awareness, prevention and interventional strategies in place. We also found considerable variation in the use of terminologies associated with BQ.

This paper describes the characteristics of chewing tobacco/betel quid users in Indonesia, to understand the user population and inform future research.Methods:The 2011 Indonesia GATS included 8,176 adults ages 15 and older. These data are weighted to be nationally representative. Weighted descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were run using SAS 9.4.Results:Estimated national prevalence for exclusive chewing tobacco/betel quid use was 0.9%, for exclusive smoked tobacco use was 33.9% and for dual use was 0.8%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that exclusive chewing tobacco/betel quid users were significantly more likely to be female, and to be older adults (45-64); while smokers are more likely to be male and younger (25-44).Conclusions/Importance:These results provide information on the different characteristics of users by product type, and show that users' demographics vary by their product of choice. This study helps to inform researchers and practitioners of the burden of chewing tobacco/betel quid use in Indonesia. These data, especially specific data on chewing tobacco/betel quid use patterns, are limited in this context, and this knowledge can help to identify populations who need quit tobacco interventions.

This study aimed to compare self-reported PM of individuals with stroke to healthy controls, to determine if PM is impaired after stroke. Additionally, self-reported PM for individuals with stroke was compared to significant-other reports, ascertaining a level of self-awareness of PM function. Twenty-eight individuals with stroke, 25 significant-others, and 27 healthy controls completed the Brief Assessment of PM (BAPM) and the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) as part of a larger study. Individuals with stroke reported significantly more Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) PM failures compared to controls on Part A of the BAPM. On Part B, individuals with stroke reported BADL PM failures to be less problematic/important than controls, suggesting a lack of self-awareness into the consequences of PM failure. Individuals with stroke also reported significantly more PM and RM failures compared to controls on the PRMQ. No significant differences were found between individuals with stroke and their significant-others on both the BAPM and PRMQ. Results of this study helped to clarify the previous research and highlighted that individuals with stroke reported more PM failures than controls but underestimated the importance of such memory lapses.

J	Toma, Simone; Caputo, Veronica; Santello, Marco								Visual Feedback of Object Motion Direction Influences the Timing of Grip Force Modulation During Object Manipulation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						198	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00198			MAY 29 2020	2020	During manipulation, object slipping is prevented by modulating the grip force (GF) in synchrony with motion-related inertial forces, i.e., load force (LF). However, due to conduction delays of the sensory system, GF must be modulated in advance based on predictions of LF changes. It has been proposed that such predictive force control relies on internal representations, i.e., internal models, of the relation between the dynamic of the environment and movement kinematics. Somatosensory and visual feedback plays a primary role in building these internal representations. For instance, it has been shown that manipulation-dependent somatosensory signals contribute to building internal representations of gravity in normal and altered gravitational contexts. Furthermore, delaying the timing of visual feedback of object displacement has been shown to affect GF. Here, we explored whether and the extent to which spatial features of visual feedback movement, such as motion direction, may contribute to GF control. If this were the case, a spatial mismatch between actual (somatosensory) and visual feedback of object motion would elicit changes in GF modulation. We tested this hypothesis by asking participants to generate vertical object movements while visual feedback of object position was congruent (0 degrees rotation) or incongruent (180 degrees or 90 degrees) with the actual object displacement. The role of vision on GF control was quantified by the temporal shift of GF modulation as a function of visual feedback orientation and actual object motion direction. GF control was affected by visual feedback when this was incongruent in the vertical (180 degrees), but not horizontal dimension. Importantly, 180 degrees visual feedback rotation delayed and anticipated GF modulation during upward and downward actual movements, respectively. Our findings suggest that during manipulation, spatial features of visual feedback motion are used to predict upcoming LF changes. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence that an internal model of gravity contributes to GF control by influencing sensory reweighting processes during object manipulation.

Which approach to measure cognitive functioning should be preferred when exploring the association between cognitive functioning and participation after stroke?								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				31	8			1207	1223		10.1080/09602011.2020.1769687			SEP 14 2021	2021	A variety of approaches are currently used to explore the relationship between cognitive functioning and participation after stroke. We aimed to gain insight into the preferred approach to measure cognitive functioning when exploring the association between cognitive functioning and participation in the long term after stroke. In this inception cohort study 128 individuals with stroke participated and were assessed at a single time point three to four years after the event. Participation was measured using the Restrictions subscale of the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation. Subjective cognitive complaints were assessed using the Cognition subscale of the Checklist for Cognitive and Emotional Consequences (CLCE-24-C). Objective cognitive performance was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) testing multiple cognitive domains. Participation showed a strong correlation (r = 0.51) with the CLCE-24-C and moderate correlations with the domains of visuospatial perception (r = 0.37) and mental speed (r = 0.36). Backward linear regression analyses showed that participation restrictions were best explained by the combination of the CLCE-24-C and a test for visuospatial perception (R-2 = 0.31). Our findings suggest the use of a combination of subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive performance to explore the relationship between cognitive functioning and participation after stroke.

J	Keshavarzi, Mahmoud; Reichenbach, Tobias								Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation With the Theta-Band Portion of the Temporally-Aligned Speech Envelope Improves Speech-in-Noise Comprehension								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						187	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00187			MAY 29 2020	2020	Transcranial alternating current stimulation with the speech envelope can modulate the comprehension of speech in noise. The modulation stems from the theta- but not the delta-band portion of the speech envelope, and likely reflects the entrainment of neural activity in the theta frequency band, which may aid the parsing of the speech stream. The influence of the current stimulation on speech comprehension can vary with the time delay between the current waveform and the audio signal. While this effect has been investigated for current stimulation based on the entire speech envelope, it has not yet been measured when the current waveform follows the theta-band portion of the speech envelope. Here, we show that transcranial current stimulation with the speech envelope filtered in the theta frequency band improves speech comprehension as compared to a sham stimulus. The improvement occurs when there is no time delay between the current and the speech stimulus, as well as when the temporal delay is comparatively short, 90 ms. In contrast, longer delays, as well as negative delays, do not impact speech-in-noise comprehension. Moreover, we find that the improvement of speech comprehension at no or small delays of the current stimulation is consistent across participants. Our findings suggest that cortical entrainment to speech is most influenced through current stimulation that follows the speech envelope with at most a small delay. They also open a path to enhancing the perception of speech in noise, an issue that is particularly important for people with hearing impairment.

Using a single-subject design with group-level analyses, 27 persons with aphasia (PWA) received typicality-based SFA to improve their naming of atypical and/or typical exemplars. Progress on trained, untrained, and monitored items was measured weekly. Pre- and post-treatment assessments were administered to evaluate semantic/phonological processing and overall language ability. Ten PWA served as controls. For the treatment participants, the likelihood of naming trained items accurately was significantly higher than for monitored items over time. When features of atypical items were trained, the likelihood of naming untrained typical items accurately was significantly higher than for untrained atypical items over time. Significant gains were observed on semantic/phonological processing tasks and standardised assessments after therapy. Different patterns of near and far transfer were seen across treatment response groups. Performance was also compared between responders and controls. Responders demonstrated significantly more improvement on a semantic processing task than controls, but no other significant change score differences were found between groups. In addition to positive treatment effects, typicality-based SFA naming therapy resulted in generalisation across multiple levels.

This paper describes the systematic recommendation of outcome instruments to address psychosocial functioning following pediatric TBI. A total of 65 instruments across 11 psychosocial areas (i.e., Global Outcome, Communication, Social Cognition, Behavioural and Executive Function, Other Neuropsychological Functioning, Psychological Status, TBI-related Symptoms, Activities and Participation, Support and Relationships, Sense of Self, and Health-Related Quality of Life) were reviewed using various assessment methods, including working groups, literature searches, comparisons with selection guidelines, and international expert opinion. Each measure was reviewed for its usefulness across early recovery, intervention, and outcome related studies. 34 instruments were recommended and classified according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health taxonomy and categorised by psychosocial area. This compilation provides a common framework to guide the activities of clinicians and researchers in psychosocial rehabilitation. It is anticipated that these will foster a multidisciplinary approach to psychosocial dysfunction to enhance the evaluation, prediction, and improvement of functional outcomes for those with pediatric TBI.

Among others, the pre-stimulus microstates' topography, representing the whole brain activity, has been proposed as a promising index of the anticipatory period in several cognitive tasks. However, to date, a clear relationship between the metrics of the pre-stimulus microstates [i.e., the global explained variance (GEV) and the frequency of occurrence (FOO)] and well-known electroencephalography marker of the anticipation (i.e., the alpha power reduction) has not been investigated. Here, after extracting the microstates during the expectancy of the semantic memory task, we investigate the correlations between the microstate features and the anticipatory alpha (8-12 Hz) power reduction (i.e., the event-related de-synchronization of the alpha rhythms; ERD) that is widely interpreted as a functional correlate of brain activation. We report a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate and both the mean amplitude of high-alpha ERD and the magnitude of the alpha ERD peak so that the stronger the decrease (percentage) in the alpha power, the higher the FOO of the dominant microstate. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant microstate and the latency of the alpha ERD peak, suggesting that subjects with higher FOO present the stronger alpha ERD closely to the target. These correlations are not significant between the GEV and all anticipatory alpha ERD indices. Our results suggest that only the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate should be considered as a useful electrophysiological correlate of the cortical activation.

The study was conducted in a closed male prison in the UK. The purposive sample comprised 55 male prisoners who arrived at the establishment during the study. A repeated measures design was used, where the Brain Injury Screening Index (BISI) was administered on three occasions. Inter-rater reliability was poor to moderate, but test retest reliability was moderate to good. Medical records were not available for all participants, but the limited number obtained resulted in a sensitivity of .38 to .71 and specificity of .47 to .70 across the three screening administrations of the BISI. The limitations of the present findings are discussed in the context of the use of the tool in custodial environments. It is argued that these results suggest that, when used as recommended, the BISI has acceptable reliability and validity as an initial screen for identifying individuals who should receive support and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, and it merits further investigation and development.

In the present study we incorporated Working Memory Training (WMT) in GMT to explore their combined efficacy in facilitating the serial-order maintenance of the steps that had to be learned. GMT+WMT was compared to a control WMT designed for other purposes. For this purpose 18 brain-injured patients (aged 20-54), who were at least 4 months post-onset, were randomly assigned to either the GMT+WMT or the WMT treatment. Inclusion was based on a baseline score of less than six correct steps on each of two multistep everyday tasks. Alternative versions of these tasks were used as primary outcome tasks. Pre-treatment and post-treatment comparisons of scores on these primary tasks and on several secondary neuropsychological measures were collected. The results show that post-treatment the GMT+WMT group performed significantly better than the WMT group on the primary outcome measures and on several ecologically valid executive tests that demanded a step-by-step maintenance of multiple actions. Time effects were found for both groups on the secondary measures. Other measures showed no significant differences. We conclude that our results support the efficacy of the combined GMT+WMT in facilitating performance in everyday multistep tasks.		[Emmanouel, Anna; Kessels, Roy P.

As traumatic brain injury and stroke both have a recovery potential, we investigate cognitive recovery in this context. Given the involvement of resilience in physiological recovery and positive emotions in enhancing cognitive capacities, we hypothesised that resilience could be related to cognitive abilities and recovery following traumatic brain injury and stroke. Our results show the same degree of resilience and cognitive capacities in our participants in two separate assessments. An improvement in cognitive abilities was observed, as was a correlation between these abilities and resilience. In other words, the greater the resilience, the higher the patient's cognitive performances. Resilience appears to influence cognitive abilities in participants with brain damage and also be involved in recovery.

We enrolled 114 community dwelling adults (55 years or older) in the study: all participants completed the MT and four other neuropsychological screening measures. Construct validity was evaluated using a three-step hierarchical regression model with the MT as the dependent variable. Demographic control variables were entered at step 1, followed by the Brief Interview of Mental Status (BIMS), and the Trail Making Test A (TMT A) at step 2, and finally TMT B and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at step 3. It was hypothesised that measures sensitive to executive functioning (TMT B and MoCA) would significantly explain MT performance after controlling for demographic variables and adding measures of cognitive function to the model, providing additional evidence for construct validity of the MT. All three steps of the model were statistically significant (p < 0.01). Inclusion of measures sensitive to executive function in step 3 explained 30% of variability in MT score (adjusted R-2 = 0.30). Our findings provide further empirical support for the construct validity of the MT, and offer implications for the use of the MT in acute and post-acute care settings.

Assessment and treatment were delivered remotely through Skype. Treatment consisted of two phases of lexical retrieval therapy (Repetition and Reading in the Presence of a Picture: RRIPP), with and without written responses (Phases 1 and 2 respectively), and a third treatment phase based on the procedures of Conceptual Enrichment (COEN) therapy. The first two phases of treatment resulted in short-lasting improvements in spoken and written word retrieval, with greater improvement in Phase 2 when written production was also required. Both treatment phases resulted in gains only for treated items, but generalised to different depictions to those treated. However, Phase 2 also resulted in significant improvement of treated items on a comprehension task. COEN treatment did not result in significant gains in word retrieval or comprehension. This study reinforces the value of a simple lexical retrieval treatment delivered remotely. It adds to the current evidence that anomia in svPPA can be responsive to treatment, but also shows that challenges remain regarding maintenance effects and the generalisation of treatment effects to connected speech.

However, the nature of this relationship is unclear; furthermore, research among young people with ABI is limited. The objective of this cross-sectional study was (1) to investigate levels of depression in young outpatients with ABI (15-30 years old) and (2) to determine how different dimensions of fatigue relate to depression. Five dimensions of fatigue were assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), and depression was assessed with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI). Mann-Whitney U-tests and multiple regression analyses were conducted. The ABI group (n = 105), on average 23.7 years old (SD = 4.2) and 31 months post-injury (SD = 61), had elevated levels of fatigue and depression compared to a convenience sample of 160 healthy controls, all p's < .001. In multivariate analyses, the predominantly mental dimensions of fatigue, General Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, and Reduced Motivation, were independently associated with MDI, all p's < .01, while the physical dimensions, Physical Fatigue and Reduced Activity, were not. Distinctions within the concept of fatigue may be important in relation to depression, and future research could benefit from adopting a multidimensional approach in the development of more targeted and effective treatments of fatigue and depression following ABI.

Feasibility and effectiveness of computerised cognitive training for memory dysfunction following stroke: A series of single case studies								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				30	5			829	852		10.1080/09602011.2018.1503083			MAY 27 2020	2020	Computerised cognitive training (CCT) approaches to memory rehabilitation represent an attractive alternative to traditional approaches; however, there is limited empirical evidence to support their use. An AB with follow up single case design was repeated across five participants to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of CCT on subjective memory in patients with stroke. Target behaviour was subjective everyday and prospective memory failures which were assessed weekly. Following baseline (three weeks), participants completed six weeks of Lumosity(TM) training in their homes. Data were analysed visually and statistically. The frequency of prospective memory failures decreased during intervention for one participant, while the frequency of prospective and everyday memory failures decreased significantly during the follow up period for another participant. Yet, significantly more everyday and prospective memory failures were reported following training by one study participant. No significant change in subjective memory ratings was found for remaining participants. Regarding secondary outcomes, meaningful changes on objective measures of memory were not observed, despite considerable inter-individual variability. Three participants reported improvement in individualised memory goals, while two participants described a decline. Overall, Lumosity(TM) training appears feasible; however, no consistent evidence to support effectiveness of this CCT on subjective or objective memory was found.

Despite the range of assessments that examine the effects of executive dysfunction on daily tasks, there remains a paucity of literature that examines the influence of the environment on performance in the community. The MET-Home is an ecologically valid assessment for examining post-stroke executive dysfunction in the home environment. This qualitative study explores the relationship between the environment and MET-Home performance among home-dwelling adults with stroke and matched controls. Using a descriptive qualitative approach, we analysed video, interview, and observation notes from a MET-Home validation study. An overarching theme of interplay between everyday task performance and the home environment produced further themes: naturalistically emerging supports and barriers and environment as strategy. Within naturalistically emerging supports and barriers, five contextual sub-themes were discovered: physical environment, social environment, temporal context, virtual context, and personal context. Within environment as strategy, we identified four sub-themes: reducing distractions, using everyday technologies, planning in context, and seeking social support. These findings extend the conceptualisation of how we evaluate executive dysfunction in the context of the community to also consider the inherent influence of the environment.

The optic flow (OF) through the windshield has been reported to divert attention and could impair visibility. Although a growing number of behavioral and neuroimaging studies have assessed drivers' attention in various driving scenarios, there is still little evidence of a relationship between OF, windshield shape, and driver's attentional efficacy. The purpose of this research was to examine this relationship. Methods: First, we quantified the OF across the windshield in a simulated driving scenario with either of two types of the windshield (a tilted or vertical pillar) at different speeds (60 km/h or 160 km/h) and found more upward OF along the tilted pillar than along the vertical pillar. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predominance of upward OF around the windshield along a tilted pillar could distract a driver and that we could observe the corresponding neural activity. Magnetic resonance scans were then obtained while the subjects performed a visual detection task while watching the driving scene used in the OF analysis. The subjects were required to press a button as rapidly as possible when a target appeared at one of five positions (leftmost, left, center, right, and rightmost). Results: We found that the reaction time (RT) on exposure to a tilted pillar was longer than that on exposure to a vertical pillar in the leftmost and rightmost conditions. Furthermore, there was more brain activity in the precuneus when the pillar was tilted than when it was vertical in the rightmost condition near the pillar. In a separate analysis, activation in the precuneus was found to reflect relative changes in the amount of upward OF when the target was at the rightmost position. Conclusions: Overall, these observations suggest that activation in the precuneus may reflect extraneous cognitive load driven by upward OF along the pillar and could distract visual attention. The findings of this study highlight the value of a cognitive neuroscientific approach to research and development in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry.

Muscle activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects.

Early Engagement of Parietal Cortex for Subtraction Solving Predicts Longitudinal Gains in Behavioral Fluency in Children								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						163	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00163			MAY 26 2020	2020	There is debate in the literature regarding how single-digit arithmetic fluency is achieved over development. While the Fact-retrieval hypothesis suggests that with practice, children shift from quantity-based procedures to verbally retrieving arithmetic problems from long-term memory, the Schema-based hypothesis claims that problems are solved through quantity-based procedures and that practice leads to these procedures becoming more automatic. To test these hypotheses, a sample of 46 typically developing children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when they were 11 years old (time 1), and 2 years later (time 2). We independently defined regions of interest (ROIs) involved in verbal and quantity processing using rhyming and numerosity judgment localizer tasks, respectively. The verbal ROIs consisted of left middle/superior temporal gyri (MTG/STG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), whereas the quantity ROIs consisted of bilateral inferior/superior parietal lobules (IPL/SPL) and bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG)/right IFG. Participants also solved a single-digit subtraction task in the scanner. We defined the extent to which children relied on verbal vs. quantity mechanisms by selecting the 100 voxels showing maximal activation at time 1 from each ROI, separately for small and large subtractions. We studied the brain mechanisms at time 1 that predicted gains in subtraction fluency and how these mechanisms changed over time with improvement. When looking at brain activation at time 1, we found that improvers showed a larger neural problem size effect in bilateral parietal cortex, whereas no effects were found in verbal regions. Results also revealed that children who showed improvement in behavioral fluency for large subtraction problems showed decreased activation over time for large subtractions in both parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity, whereas non-improvers maintained similar levels of activation. All children, regardless of improvement, showed decreased activation over time for large subtraction problems in verbal regions. The greater parietal problem size effect at time 1 and the reduction in activation over time for the improvers in parietal and frontal regions implicated in quantity processing is consistent with the Schema-based hypothesis arguing for more automatic procedures with increasing skill. The lack of a problem size effect at time 1 and the overall decrease in verbal regions, regardless of improvement, is inconsistent with the Fact-retrieval hypothesis.

Depending on the social interaction context, sensorimotor communication can serve different functions. This article aims to disentangle three of these functions: (a) an informing function of body movements, to highlight action intentions for an observer; (b) a coordinating function of body movements, to facilitate real-time action prediction in joint action; and (c) a performing function of body movements, to elicit emotional or aesthetic experiences in an audience. We provide examples of research addressing these different functions as well as some influencing factors, relating to individual differences, task characteristics, and situational demands. The article concludes by discussing the benefits of a closer dialog between separate lines of research on sensorimotor communication across different social contexts.

We analyzed the contributions of four main models - processing resources, speed of processing, cognitive reserve and knowledge - to source memory decay related to the aging process. Methods: A total of 1554 healthy adults between 21 and 80 years old participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was conducted on data from the whole sample and separately in the data from young, middle-aged and older adult age groups. To estimate each cognitive model, we measured working memory discrimination levels (processing resources), working memory reaction times (speed of processing), education (cognitive reserve) and vocabulary (knowledge). Results: Processing resources mediate the effects of age on source memory across the adult lifespan, whereas speed of processing mediates these effects only in young adults, cognitive reserve only in middle-aged adults and knowledge only in older adults. Conclusions: Processing resources was the cognitive model that most contributes to explaining source memory decay. The fact that the other models are relevant to specific age groups provides useful information to exploit their benefits to preserve source memory in specific life stages.

The current longitudinal study examined the presence of peer and parental interpersonal relationship consequences (IP) as a motivating factor in activating coping skills to decrease the frequency of adolescent substance use, while further evaluating the role of impulsivity within that process.Objectives:Two main hypotheses were proposed: (1) IP will decrease substance use frequency mediated by increases in motivation and temptation coping; and (2) impulsivity will moderate the link between coping and substance use frequency. Participants included 343 adolescents between the ages of 13-19 (M = 16.23) referred to Project READY, a school-based substance use intervention. Assessments were completed during Sessions 1 and 4 of the intervention.Results:Serial mediation analyses indicated temptation coping, baseline alcohol use, and Time 2 marijuana use were the only statistically significant predictors of Time 2 alcohol use. Temptation coping and baseline marijuana use were the only statistically significant predictors of Time 2 marijuana use.Conclusions:Once adolescents' baseline and concurrent substance use were incorporated into the model, there was no statistical significance of the indirect effects. Results provided a stronger examination of the factors related to long-term substance use among adolescents. Knowing that temptation coping and baseline substance use levels were significant predictors of time 2 substance use independent of interpersonal consequences and motivation to change provides a structural frame and highlights need for early intervention.

The current study extends prior research by assessing whether response inhibition and working memory are associated with at-risk youth's willingness to use NTPs.Methods:A sample of 1060 at-risk youth were recruited from alternative high schools in southern California. Participants were randomly assigned to complete the Symmetry Span Task, an indicator of working memory ability, or the cued Go/No-Go task, an indicator of response inhibition. Participants who reported never using NTPs (n = 348) indicated how willing they would be try NTPs.Results:Results from a cross-sectional zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression suggest that females with stronger working memory skills and individuals with weaker response inhibition skills were more likely to be unwilling to use NTPs.Conclusion:While further research is needed to determine whether executive functions can prospectively predict NTP use among at-risk youth, the current study indicates that both working memory and response inhibition may play a significant role.

The mean age of the victims was 33.49 +/- 15.19 years. The majority of the victims were male (84.14%) and the prevalence of positive BAC was higher amongst men (28.74%) than women (18.16%). Homicide was the most prevalent cause of death in the sample (36.57%), but there were a higher proportion of traffic accidents victims with positive BAC (32.01%), as well as higher BAC levels in these victims (46.77% in the range of 1.6-2.5 g/L).Conclusions: The results obtained in this study support a potential association between alcohol consumption and violent deaths in the city of Sao Paulo, mainly in traffic accidents victims.

Alcohol is the most prevalent high-risk substance used by 12th grade students with 69.8% of students having consumed alcohol over their lifetime. Vaping is the next highly used substance with 28.9% of students in 12th grade having vaped 30 day prior to the survey. There is a significant correlation among adolescents between smoking cigarettes and using smokeless tobacco. A student using either alcohol, cigarettes or smokeless tobacco is highly likely to use the other two substances as well. Adolescents from counties with a high Caucasian population were at high risk for cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, while the opposite held true for counties with a high number of foreign-born persons or higher Asian or Hispanic populations. Higher median household incomes and higher adult education levels in a county were both protective factors against smokeless tobacco use.Conclusions:Results of the study suggest that students start experimenting with high-risk substance use in early grades and to combat the prevalence, we suggest the importance of educating adolescents of the dangers of drug use in early grades.

Such interpersonal coordination can arise solely based on the observation of the partners' and/or the object's movements, without the presence of verbal communication. In this paper, we investigate how the social coupling between two individuals in a collaborative task translates into measured objective and subjective performance indicators recorded in two different studies. We analyse the trends in the dyadic interrelationship based on the information-theoretic measure of transfer entropy and identify emerging leader-follower roles. In our experimental paradigm, the actions of the pair of subjects are continuously and seamlessly fused, resulting in a joint control of an object simulated on a tablet computer. Subjects need to synchronize their movements with a 90 degrees phase difference in order to keep the object (a ball) rotating precisely on a predefined circular or elliptic trajectory on a tablet device. Results demonstrate how the identification of causal dependencies in this social interaction task could reveal specific trends in human behavior and provide insights into the emergence of social sensorimotor contingencies.

Neglect results in a reduction in qualityof life and performance in activities of daily living. With current technical improvements in virtual reality (VR) technology, trainingwith stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMD) has become a promising new approach for the assessment and the rehabilitation of neglect. The focus of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate a simple visual search task in VR for HMD. The VR system was tested regarding feasibility, acceptance, and potential adverse effects in healthy controls and right-hemispheric stroke patients with and without neglect. Methods: The VR system consisted of two main components, a head-mounted display to present the virtual environment, and a hand-held controller for the interaction with the latter. The task followed the rationale of diagnostic paper-pencil cancellation tasks; i.e., the participants were asked to search targets among distractors. However, instead of a two-dimensional setup, the targets and distractors were arranged in three dimensions, in a sphere around the subject inside its field of view. Usability and acceptance of the task, as well as the performance in the latter, were tested in 15 right-hemispheric subacute stroke patients (10 of whom with and five of whom without unilateral spatial neglect; mean age: 67.1 +/- 10.5 years) and 35 age-matched healthy controls. Results: System usability and acceptance were rated as high both in stroke patients and healthy controls, close to the maximum score of the questionnaire scale. No relevant adverse effects occurred. There was a high correlation (r = 0.854, p = 0.002) between the Center of Cancellation [an objective neglect measure) calculated from a paper-pencil cancellation task (Sensitive Neglect Test (SNT)] and the newly developed VR cancellation task. Conclusion: Overall, the developed visual search task in the tested VR system is feasible, well-accepted, enjoyable, and does not evoke any significant negative effects, both for healthy controls and for stroke patients. Findings for task performance show that the ability of the VR cancellation to detect neglect in stroke patients is similar to paper-pencil cancellation tasks.		[Knobel, Samuel E.

Design: Subjects were 11 children with ANSD ranging in age between 6.4 and 16.2 years. The stimulus was an /aba/-/apa/ vowel-consonant-vowel continuum comprising eight tokens with VOTs ranging from 0 ms (voiced endpoint) to 88 ms (voiceless endpoint). For speech in noise, speech tokens were mixed with the speech-shaped noise from the Hearing In Noise Test at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +5 dB. Speech-evoked auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral categorization perception of VOT were measured in quiet in all subjects, and at an SNR of +5 dB in seven subjects. The stimuli were presented at 35 dB SL (re: pure tone average) or 115 dB SPL if this limit was less than 35 dB SL. In addition to the onset response, the auditory change complex (ACC) elicited by VOT was recorded in eight subjects. Results: Speech evoked ERPs recorded in all subjects consisted of a vertex positive peak (i.e., P1), followed by a trough occurring approximately 100 ms later (i.e., N2). For results measured in quiet, there was no significant difference in categorical boundaries estimated using ERP measures and behavioral procedures. Categorical boundaries estimated in quiet using both ERP and behavioral measures closely correlated with the most-recently measured Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten (PBK) scores. Adding a competing background noise did not affect categorical boundaries estimated using either behavioral or ERP procedures in three subjects. For the other four subjects, categorical boundaries estimated in noise using behavioral measures were prolonged. However, adding background noise only increased categorical boundaries measured using ERPs in three out of these four subjects. Conclusions: VCV continuum can be used to evaluate behavioral identification and the neural encoding of VOT in children with ANSD. In quiet, categorical boundaries of VOT estimated using behavioral measures and ERP recordings are closely associated with speech recognition performance in children with ANSD. Underlying mechanisms for excessive speech perception deficits in noise may vary for individual patients with ANSD.

Brain Metabolism During A Lower Extremity Voluntary Movement Task in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						159	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00159			MAY 25 2020	2020	Reduced selective voluntary motor control (SVMC) is a primary impairment due to corticospinal tract (CST) injury in spastic cerebral palsy (CP). There are few studies of brain metabolism in CP and none have examined brain metabolism during a motor task. Nine children with bilateral spastic CP [Age: 6-11 years, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Levels II-V] completed this study. SVMC was evaluated using Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (normal). Brain metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in association with a selective ankle motor task. Whole brain activation maps as well as ROI averaged metabolic activity were correlated with SCALE scores. The contralateral sensorimotor and superior parietal cortex were positively correlated with SCALE scores (p < 0.0005). In contrast, a negative correlation of metabolic activity with SCALE was found in the cerebellum (p < 0.0005). Subsequent ROI analysis showed that both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar metabolism correlated with SCALE but the relationship for the ipsilateral cerebellum was stronger (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001 vs. R-2 = 0.46, p = 0.045). Decreased cortical and increased cerebellar activation in children with less SVMC may be related to task difficulty, activation of new motor learning paradigms in the cerebellum and potential engagement of alternative motor systems when CSTs are focally damaged. These results support SCALE as a clinical correlate of neurological impairment.

J	Timm, Fabian; Kuehn, Esther								A Mechanical Stimulation Glove to Induce Hebbian Plasticity at the Fingertip								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						177	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00177			MAY 25 2020	2020	Repetitive sensory stimulation of the fingertip induces Hebbian plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex that benefits the tactile and motor behavior of the hand in healthy younger adults, older adults, and patients. To use this method outside the laboratory, robust and portable stimulation systems are needed that allow prolonged stimulation phases over several hours without compromising on signal intensity or personal mobility. Here, we introduce two stimulation gloves that apply finger- and frequency-specific mechanical stimulation to individual fingertips over prolonged periods. The stimulators are built into commercially available cotton gloves and apply stimulation either via loudspeaker membranes or via linear resonant actuators (LRAs). We tested the efficiency of both gloves to induce Hebbian plasticity in younger adults by using two established measures of tactile performance, the grating orientation task (GOT), and the two-point discrimination task (2PDT). Both tests were performed before and after 3 h of sensory finger stimulation using one of either glove system. As a control condition, a non-stimulated finger was tested in both tasks before and after stimulation. The results show no significant effect of sensory stimulation on GOT thresholds, but a significant decrease in the 2PDT thresholds after compared to before the training at the stimulated finger only. The loudspeaker membrane improved performance in the 2PDT in 10/16 participants, whereas the LRA improved performance in the 2PDT in 13/16 participants. Stimulation gloves with built-in modules may be used in future larger-scale cohort studies on sensorimotor plasticity, rehabilitation, and learning.

Methods In a within-subjects design, we tested 20 young adults (M (age) = 22.3 years) with and without the Age Simulation Suit. We assessed gross motor (Functional Fitness test) and fine motor (Purdue Pegboard test) functioning, cognitive performance (Digit Symbol Substitution test), and questionnaires on perceived physical state and mood. Gross and fine motor tests provided norms for large samples of older adults. Results Wearing the Age Simulation Suit leads to significant performance reductions in all task dimensions, with large effect sizes. Depending on the subtest, participants' performances were reduced to the level of mid-50- to 85-years-olds for almost all tests of gross and fine motor performance. Mood and perceived physical state also declined while wearing the suit. Conclusion We argue that the GERT suit offers an attractive possibility to experimentally simulate the effects of aging-related sensory and motor losses and propose future studies with this paradigm, in the context of cognitive-motor dual-tasking or motor learning.

Purpose: The present study examined expectancies about the impact of cannabis on cognitive, affective and behavioral ED symptoms. Additionally, this study explored associations between cannabis-related expectancies, cannabis use and cannabis-related problems. Methods: Cannabis users with ED symptoms (N = 137) reported on frequency of cannabis use, cannabis-related problems and expectancies about the impact of cannabis on ED symptoms, Results: Participants expected cannabis to decrease restrictive eating, compensatory behaviors, and preoccupation with body shape and weight and fear of eating and weight gain. In contrast, cannabis was expected to increase binge-eating behaviors. Expectancies about the impact of cannabis use on ED symptoms were not associated with more frequent cannabis use nor were they associated with cannabis-related problems. Conclusions: These findings suggest that individuals believe cannabis will improve some ED symptoms; however, these expected improvements are not associated with increased cannabis use and problems. Future research should examine cannabis expectancies in clinical populations and should further explore the association between cannabis expectancies, use, and ED symptoms longitudinally.

Empathy-Related Brain Activity in Somatosensory Cortex Protects From Tactile Priming Effects: A Pilot Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						142	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00142			MAY 21 2020	2020	Empathy influences how we perceive, understand, and interact with our social environment. Previous studies suggested a network of different brain regions as a neural substrate for empathy, including, in particular, insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, a contribution of the somatosensory cortices for this empathy related network has been suggested. This is remarkable, given that other recent studies have revealed a role for the somatosensory cortex in various social tasks. For example, in experiments using tactile priming, incidental haptic sensations are found to influence judgment recommendations. Here, we aimed to test if this engagement of the somatosensory cortices during tactile priming can be predicted by the participant's empathy personality traits. We assessed participant's empathy and personality traits by means of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and NEO-FFI and tested whether trait empathy is associated with the tactile priming effect in social judgments. Results revealed that empathy predicted the tactile priming effect negatively. This was accompanied by a reduced engagement of the somatosensory cortex, which has been shown to be associated with the priming effect. We conclude that empathy seems to protect people from tactile priming effects.

While various neuroimaging techniques have been used to investigate the pathophysiology of FOG, changes in corticomotor excitability associated with FOG have yet to be determined. Research to date has not concluded if changes in corticomotor excitability are associated with gait disturbances in this patient population. This study aimed to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticomotor excitability changes associated with FOG. Furthermore, the relationship between corticomotor excitability and gait performances would be determined. Methods Eighteen participants with PD and FOG (PD + FOG), 15 without FOG (PD - FOG), and 15 non-disabled adults (Control) were recruited for this study. Single and paired-pulse TMS paradigms were used to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability, respectively. Gait performance was measured by the 10-Meter-Walk test. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between TMS outcomes and gait parameters. Results Compared with the Control group, the PD + FOG group showed a significantly lower resting motor threshold and reduced short intracortical inhibition (SICI). Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between resting motor evoked potential and step length, and between SICI and walking velocity in the Control group. While the silent period correlated with step length in the PD - FOG group, no significant relationship was observed in the PD + FOG group. Discussion and Conclusion Compared to the Control group, the PD + FOG group exhibited reduced corticomotor inhibition. Distinct correlations observed among the three groups suggest that the function of the corticomotor system plays an important role in mediating walking ability in non-disabled adults and people with PD - FOG, while people with PD + FOG may rely on neural networks other than the corticomotor system to control gait.

More research is needed to characterize this emerging "twin epidemic."Objectives:The study aims to identify social and behavioral characteristics associated with methamphetamine use among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) in the Dayton, Ohio, area, an epicenter of the opioid crisis and an emerging frontier of methamphetamine epidemic.Methods:357 adult individuals with current OUD were recruited using targeted and respondent-driven sampling. Structured interviews collected information on social and drug use characteristics. Multivariable Logistic Regression was used to identify characteristics associated with the past 6-month use of methamphetamine.Results:49.7% were female, and 88.8% were non-Hispanic whites. 55.6% used methamphetamine in the past 6-months, and 84.9% reported first use of methamphetamine after initiation of illicit opioids. Methamphetamine use was associated with homelessness (aOR = 2.46,p = .0001), lifetime history of diverted pharmaceutical stimulant use (aOR = 2.97,p < .001), injection route of heroin/fentanyl use (aOR = 1.89,p = .03), preference for fentanyl over heroin (aOR = 1.82,p = .048), lifetime history of extended-release injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol)-based treatment (aOR = 2.89,p = .003), and more frequent marijuana use (aOR = 1.26,p = .04).Discussion:The findings point to the complexity of motivational and behavioral pathways associated with methamphetamine and opioid co-use, ranging from self-treatment and substitution behaviors, attempts to endure homelessness, and greater risk taking to experience euphoria. More research is needed to understand the causal relationships and the association between methamphetamine and Vivitrol use. Public health responses to the opioid crisis need to be urgently expanded to address the growing epidemic of methamphetamine use.

Data were collected from October 2018 to August 2019 using a researcher-made questionnaire.Results:Mean age of the participants was 36.1 +/- 13.3 years. Ordinal regression model, after the control of confounding variables, showed that attitudes, self-efficacy, habits, and intention were the most important predictors of HS behavior in women (OR = 1.14). The prevalence of HS was 1.76 times higher in women who did not want to quit hookah.

More research is needed to understand the association of opioids and mental health for older adults. This study examined age differences in the association of non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) and psychological distress, with a focus on older adult populations.Methods: This study used the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and included 37,842 adults aged 18 and older. Weighted multiple regression and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association of NMPOU and psychological distress, measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6).Results: NMPOU was associated with higher psychological distress (b = 0.48, SE = 0.16,p < .01). For those 50 and older, NMPOU was associated with 224% increased odds of meeting the clinical threshold for having a serious mental illness (SMI; OR = 2.24,p < .01, 95% CI: 1.23, 4.09).Conclusions: Although the prevalence of NMPOU and psychological distress trended downward throughout the lifespan, the association of NMPOU on SMI was highest among the youngest and oldest adults. These findings highlight the need for services and supports that are tailored for older adult populations. Future research is needed to investigate vulnerabilities from life stage stressors specific to older adults, which may account for the disproportionate odds of opioid use on mental health pathology. Interprofessional collaboration is needed among geriatric professionals to provide effective mental health treatment for this at-risk population.

With recent evidence linking insecure attachment with sensory sensitivity, and evidence that both are linked with higher levels of distress, there is a need to consider these variables in relation to substance use in a sample of young adults.Methods:A convenience sample of 223 young adults (18-24 years) completed self-report measures of attachment, sensory sensitivity, use of various substances (e.g. alcohol, legal and illegal drugs, cigarettes, energy drinks), and distress. Correlation, t-test, and regression/mediation analyses were conducted.Results:Sensory sensitivity was positively correlated with insecure attachment. Anxious attachment was related to problematic substance use, frequent cigarette use, and misuse of prescribed medications. Avoidant attachment was associated with frequent use of cigarettes and energy drinks. Sensory sensitivity, attachment anxiety, and attachment avoidance each had significant indirect effects on problematic substance use, mediated by increased levels of distress.Conclusions:Sensory sensitivity and attachment insecurity both appear to impact problematic substance use in young adults through elevated levels of distress. Findings support consideration of sensory- and attachment-informed interventions with this population.

Fentanyl Preference among People Who Inject Drugs in West Virginia								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	11			1774	1780		10.1080/10826084.2020.1762653			AUG 3 2020	2020	Background: Overdose fatality rates in rural areas surpass those in urban areas with the state of West Virginia (WV) reporting the highest drug overdose death rate in 2017. There is a gap in understanding fentanyl preference among rural people who inject drugs (PWID). The aim of this study is to investigate factors associated with fentanyl preference among rural PWID in WV. Methods: This analysis uses data from a PWID population estimation study conducted in Cabell County, WV in June-July 2018. Factors associated with fentanyl preference were assessed using multivariable Poisson regression with a robust variance estimate. Results: Among PWID who reported having ever used fentanyl (n = 311), 43.4% reported preferring drugs containing fentanyl. Participants reported high levels of socioeconomic vulnerability, including homelessness (57.9%) and food insecurity (66.9%). Recent increases in drug use and injecting more than one drug in the past 6 months were reported by 27.0% and 84.2% of participants, respectively. In adjusted analyses, fentanyl preference was associated with being younger (PrR:0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-1.00), being female (PrR:1.45, 95% CI:1.14-1.83), being a Cabell county resident (PrR:0.60, 95% CI: 0.45-0.81), increased drug use in the past 6 months (PrR:1.28, 95% CI: 1.01-1.63), and injecting fentanyl in the past 6 months (PrR:1.89, 95% CI: 1.29-2.75). Conclusion: Fentanyl preference is highly prevalent among rural PWID in WV and associated with factors that may exacerbate overdose risks. There is an urgent need for increased access to tailored harm reduction services that address risks associated with fentanyl preference.

We investigated the incremental validity of demographics, family background, school variables, risk perception, parental alcohol attitudes, age of first alcohol use, peer group influence, and behavioral variables as they concurrently predicted last month alcohol use, binge drinking, and drunkenness experience frequency.Methods:Hierarchical multiple regression analyses in a sample ofN = 743 adolescents (mean age = 15.01).Results:All predictors explained 26-40% of the total variance. Alcohol use was predicted by age, gender, having two working parents, academic family background, relationship to parents, relative risk perception, parental acceptance of alcohol use, age of first use, talking about positive aspects of alcohol, normality of alcohol use among peers, time spent with friends, and going out to clubs. Binge drinking was predicted by age, working parents, school problems, relative risk perception, parental alcohol acceptance, age of first use, talking about positive aspects of alcohol, time spent with friends, and going out to clubs. Drunkenness was predicted by age, relationship to parents, school problems, relative risk perception, age of first use, talking about positive aspects of alcohol, and going out to clubs.Conclusions:Researchers need to take the complexity of adolescent substance use into account when designing studies and interventions. Relative risk perception emerged as the strongest (positive) predictor, indicating that adolescents are able to rather accurately assess their own risk and risk awareness alone does not suffice to engage in protective behavior.

Treating limb apraxia via action semantics: a preliminary study								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				31	7			1145	1162		10.1080/09602011.2020.1762672			AUG 9 2021	2021	Limb apraxia is evident in approximately 50% of patients after left hemisphere cerebral vascular accident (LCVA) and increases disability and caregiver dependence. Individuals with apraxia exhibit abnormalities in spatio-temporal aspects of gesture production and/or in knowledge of tool-related actions (action semantics). This preliminary study of three LCVA participants aimed to (i) explore the efficacy of a novel Action Network Treatment (ANT) that focused on improving the semantic association between tool actions and other types of tool knowledge, an intervention inspired by successful semantic network treatments in aphasia (e.g., Edmonds et al., 2009), and (ii) explore whether there are individuals with apraxia who benefit from ANT relative to a version of a comparatively well-studied existing apraxia treatment (Smania et al., 2006; Smania et al., 2000) that shapes gesture via focus on practicing the spatio-temporal aspects of gesture production (Tool Use Treatment or TUT). One participant demonstrated treatment benefits from both ANT and TUT, while another only benefited from TUT. These findings indicate that our novel semantic network strengthening approach to gesture training may be efficacious in at least some individuals with apraxia, and provide a foundation for future study of the characteristics of people with apraxia who benefit from each approach.

The discrimination of these two types of fatigue is necessary to better adapt recovery intervention. The Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements describes the neuromotor impulse response using lognormal functions and has many applications in pathology detection. The ideal motor control is modeled and a change in the neuromuscular system is reflected in parameters extracted according to this theory. Objective The objective of this study was to assess whether a shoulder neuromuscular fatigue could be detected through parameters describing the theory, if there is the possibility to discriminate central from peripheral fatigue, and which handwriting test gives the most relevant information on fatigue. Methods Twenty healthy participants performed two sessions of fast stroke handwriting on a tablet, before and after a shoulder fatigue. The fatigue was in internal rotation for one session and in external rotation during the other session. The drawings consisted of simple strokes, triangles, horizontal, and vertical oscillations. Parameters of these strokes were extracted according to the Sigma-Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory. The evolution of each participant was analyzed through a U-Mann-Whitney test for individual comparisons. A Hotelling's T-2-test and a U-Mann-Whitney test were also performed on all participants to assess the group evolution after fatigue. Moreover, a correlation among parameters was calculated through Spearman coefficients to assess intrinsic parameters properties of each handwriting test. Results Central and peripheral parameters were statistically different before and after fatigue with a possibility to discriminate them. Participants had various responses to fatigue. However, when considering the group, parameters related to the motor program execution showed significant increase in the handwriting tests after shoulder fatigue. The test of simple strokes permits to know more specifically where the fatigue comes from, whereas the oscillations tests were the most sensitive to fatigue. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that the Sigma-Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory is an innovative approach for fatigue detection with discrimination between the central and peripheral systems. Overall, there is a possibility to implement the setting for clinics and sports personalized follow-up.

Dynamic Changes in EEG Power Spectral Densities During NIH-Toolbox Flanker, Dimensional Change Card Sort Test and Episodic Memory Tests in Young Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						158	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00158			MAY 19 2020	2020	Much is known about electroencephalograph (EEG) patterns during sleep, but until recently, it was difficult to study EEG patterns during conscious, awake behavior. Technological advances such as powerful wireless EEG systems have led to a renewed interest in EEG as a clinical and research tool for studying real-time changes in the brain. We report here the first normative study of EEG activity while healthy young adults completed a series of cognitive tests recently published by the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TCB), a commonly-used standardized measure of cognition primarily used in clinical populations. In this preliminary study using a wireless EEG system, we examined power spectral density (PSD) in four EEG frequency bands. During baseline and cognitive testing, PSD activity for the lower frequency bands (theta and alpha) was greater, relative to the higher frequency bands (beta and gamma), suggesting participants were relaxed and mentally alert. Alpha, beta and gamma activity was increased during a memory test compared to two other, less demanding executive function tests. Gamma activity was also inversely correlated with performance on the memory test, consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis which proposes that better cognitive performance may link with lower cortical energy consumption. In summary, our study suggests that cognitive performance is related to the dynamics of EEG activity in a normative young adult population.

Traditional paper-and pencil tests of neglect have limited sensitivity and ecological validity. The Baking Tray Task (BTT), instead, approaches real-life situations, because it requires participants to place 16 physical objects on a board. The number of objects placed on the left and right portions of the board provides a clinical index of visual neglect. Here we present E-TAN, a technology-enhanced platform for BTT (E-BTT). E-BTT automatically determines the object locations on the board, and also records the sequence and timing of their placement. We used E-BTT to test 9 patients with right hemisphere damage and compared their performance with that obtained by 115 healthy participants. To this end, we developed a new method of analysis of participants' performance, based on the use of the convex hull described by the objects on the board. This measure provides an estimate of the portion of space processed by each participant and can effectively discriminate neglect patients from patients without neglect. E-TAN allows clinicians to assess visuospatial performance by using a convenient, fast, and relatively automatized procedure, that patients can even perform at home to follow-up the effects of rehabilitation.

This pilot study investigated a peer-led group intervention based on the claim that peer models may be a more effective mechanism for behaviour change than clinician-led approaches. Twelve participants with severe ABI were recruited from a post-acute neurorehabilitation setting and randomly assigned to either a peer-led intervention or a staff-led activity group (usual care) (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02211339). The groups met twice a week for 8 weeks. A peer was trained separately to facilitate interaction in the intervention group. Training comprised 16 individual sessions over 4 weeks. Group behaviour was measured twice at baseline, after intervention and at maintenance (4 weeks), using the Adapted Measure of Participation in Conversation (MPC) and the Interactional Network Tool (INT), a newly devised measure of group conversational interaction. Outcome measures showed differential sensitivity. The groups did not differ in baseline behaviour. Findings showed a significant improvement in the treated group on the MPC transaction scale post-intervention (p = .02). The intervention group showed more balanced interaction post-intervention on the INT and at follow-up. Findings show preliminary evidence of the advantage for peer-led groups. The INT shows promise as a method to detect a change in group communication behaviour. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02211339.

This is a cross-sectional study explored levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and identified their predictors among Jordanian individuals with stroke. Outcome measures included Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment, goniometry, hand-held dynamometry, nine-hole peg test, Ashworth scale, Motor Activity Log, ten-meter walk test, and 12-item Short-Form health survey (SF-12). Descriptive analyses were used to describe prevalence of mental health symptoms and multiple variable linear regression models were used to identify their predictors. A total of 153 individuals participated in the study. Proportions of participants with mental health symptoms were 74.5% for depression, 52.9% for anxiety, and 68% for stress. Significant predictors of post-stroke mental health symptoms were SF-12 Mental Composite Score and grip strength for depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression and stress symptoms were significantly associated with discontinuation of rehabilitation services. Furthermore, self-reports of fewer sleep hours was significantly associated with anxiety and stress. Finally, Gender and self-reported physical diseases other than stroke were significantly associated with depression symptoms. We conclude that high proportions of Jordanian individuals' post-stroke have suffered mental health symptoms. Future studies are required to design effective interventions to improve post-stroke mental health.

This randomized controlled trial of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) was designed to address this gap. Ninety-three persons with medically-documented complicated mild to severe TBI, normal-to-mildly impaired memory, and clinically significant psychological distress in the chronic phase of recovery were randomized to receive eight weeks of ACT (manualized with adaptations to address TBI-related cognitive impairments) or a single session of needs assessment, brief counseling/education, and referral. The ACT group showed significantly greater reduction of psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory 18) and demonstrated improvements in psychological flexibility and commitment to action (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) scores). The number of treatment responders (post-treatment BSI 18 GSI T scores <63) was larger in the ACT group than in the control group. Entry of AAQ-II scores into the model of between-group differences in BSI 18 GSI T scores indicated that core ACT processes explained the variance in treatment group outcomes. Provision of ACT reduces psychological distress in persons with TBI in the chronic phase of recovery when adaptations are made to accommodate TBI-related cognitive impairments. Additional clinical trials with a structurally equivalent control group are needed.

This study investigated the body and brain activity correlates of a typical daily activity, hot beverage preparation, and consumption in a realistic office environment where participants performed natural daily tasks. Using wearable, battery operated and wireless Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors, neural and physiological responses were measured in untethered, freely moving participants who prepared hot beverages using two different machines (a market leader and follower as determined by annual US sales). They later consumed the drinks they had prepared in three blocks. Emotional valence was estimated using frontal asymmetry in EEG alpha band power and emotional arousal was estimated from EDA tonic and phasic activity. Results from 26 participants showed that the market-leading coffee machine was more efficient to use based on self-reports, behavioral performance measures, and there were significant within-subject differences in valence between the two machine use. Moreover, the market leader user interface led to greater self-reported product preference, which was further supported by significant differences in measured arousal and valence (EDA and EEG, respectively) during coffee production and consumption. This is the first study that uses a multimodal and comprehensive assessment of coffee machine use and beverage consumption in a naturalistic work environment. Approaches described in this study can be adapted in the future to other task-specific machine usability and consumer neuroscience studies.

J	Nordmark, Per F.; Johansson, Roland S.								Disinhibition of Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex After Median Nerve Transection and Reinnervation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						166	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00166			MAY 15 2020	2020	Despite state-of-the-art surgical and postoperative treatment, median nerve transection causes lasting impaired hand function due to limitations in the nerve's reinnervation ability. The defective innervation and thus controllability of the affected hand can shape the brain's control of manual behaviors. Earlier studies of changes in the processing of tactile stimuli have focused mainly on stimulation of the reinnervated hand and lack sufficient control over the brain's use of the tactile input in perceptual terms. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity (BOLD-signal) in 11 people with median nerve injury and healthy controls (N= 11) when performing demanding tactile tasks using the tip of either the index or little finger of either hand. For the nerve-injured group, the left median nerve had been traumatically transected in the distal forearm and surgically repaired on average 8 years before the study. The hand representation of their contralesional (right) primary somatosensory cortex (S1) showed greater activity compared to controls when the left reinnervated index finger was used, but also when the left-hand little finger and the fingers of the right hand innervated by uninjured nerves were used. We argue that the overall increase in activity reflects a general disinhibition of contralesional S1 consistent with an augmented functional reorganizational plasticity being an ongoing feature of chronic recovery from nerve injury. Also, the nerve-injured showed increased activity within three prefrontal cortical areas implicated in higher-level behavioral processing (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), suggesting that processes supporting decision-making and response-selection were computationally more demanding due to the compromised tactile sensibility.

It involves recalling sequences of spatial locations while moving in an indoor space (2.5 x 3m) in which the CBT layout is recreated on the floor. The specific contribution of the backward WalCT (beyond that of the backward CBT) to explaining age-related effects on spatial rotation abilities was explored. Seventy young adults and 56 older adults performed the backward WalCT, classic VSWM tasks, self-assessments on pleasure in exploring and spatial anxiety, and mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks. Mediation models for the mental rotation and perspective-taking measures showed a direct age-related effect on both the backward WalCT and backward CBT, and an indirect one on the two spatial rotation abilities, mediated by the backward WalCT and - partly - the backward CBT. In particular, age-related effects on mental rotation were explained by the backward WalCT, while those on perspective-taking were explained by both the backward WalCT and backward CBT. The backward WalCT can be considered a measure suitable for assessing VSWM in older adults, which also explains age-related effects on mental rotation and perspective-taking performance.

Previous studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to demonstrate changes in corticomotor excitability following ePAS. However, the use of TMS as a measure in stroke research is limited by safety precautions, intolerance, and difficulty generating a measurable response in more severely affected individuals. We were interested in evaluating the effect of ePAS using more feasible measures in people with stroke. This study asks whether ePAS produces immediate improvements in the primary outcomes of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and total neuromuscular fatigue of the dorsiflexor muscles, and in the secondary outcomes of muscle power, voluntary activation (VA), central fatigue, peripheral fatigue, and electromyography activity. Method In this repeated-measures cross-over study, 15 participants with chronic stroke completed two interventions, ePAS and sham, in a randomized order. During ePAS, 50 repetitions of visually cued dorsiflexion were completed, while single pulses of electrical stimulation were delivered to the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve. Each somatosensory volley was timed to arrive in the primary motor cortex at the peak negativity of the MRCP. Univariate and multivariate linear mixed models were used to analyze the primary and secondary data, respectively. Results There was a statistically significant increase in dorsiflexor MVIC immediately following the ePAS intervention (mean increase 7 N), compared to the sham intervention (mean change 0 N) (univariate between-condition analysisp= 0.047). The multivariate analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of ePAS on VA of the tibialis anterior muscle, such that ePAS increased VA by 7 percentage units (95% confidence interval 1.3-12.7%). There was no statistically significant effect on total neuromuscular fatigue, muscle power, or other secondary measures. Conclusion A single session of ePAS can significantly increase isometric muscle strength and VA in people with chronic stroke. The findings confirm that ePAS has a central neuromodulatory mechanism and support further exploration of its potential as an adjunct to stroke rehabilitation. In addition, the findings offer alternative, feasible outcome measures for future research.

Electrophysiology and Structural Connectivity of the Posterior Hypothalamic Region: Much to Learn From a Rare Indication of Deep Brain Stimulation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						164	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00164			MAY 15 2020	2020	Cluster headache (CH) is among the most common and debilitating autonomic cephalalgias. We characterize clinical outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the posterior hypothalamic region through a novel analysis of the electrophysiological topography and tractography-based structural connectivity. The left posterior hypothalamus was targeted ipsilateral to the refractory CH symptoms. Intraoperatively, field potentials were captured in 1 mm depth increments. Whole-brain probabilistic tractography was conducted to assess the structural connectivity of the estimated volume of activated tissue (VAT) associated with therapeutic response. Stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic region led to the resolution of CH symptoms, and this benefit has persisted for 1.5-years post-surgically. Active contacts were within the posterior hypothalamus and dorsoposterior border of the ventral anterior thalamus (VAp). Delta- (3 Hz) and alpha-band (8 Hz) powers increased and peaked with proximity to the posterior hypothalamus. In the posterior hypothalamus, the delta-band phase was coupled to beta-band amplitude, the latter of which has been shown to increase during CH attacks. Finally, we identified that the VAT encompassing these regions had a high proportion of streamlines of pain processing regions, including the insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, precentral gyrus, and the brainstem. Our unique case study of posterior hypothalamic region DBS supports durable efficacy and provides a platform using electrophysiological topography and structural connectivity, to improve mechanistic understanding of CH and this promising therapy.

Optimizing Magnetoencephalographic Imaging Estimation of Language Lateralization for Simpler Language Tasks								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						105	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00105			MAY 15 2020	2020	Magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) offers a non-invasive alternative for defining preoperative language lateralization in neurosurgery patients. MEGI indeed can be used for accurate estimation of language lateralization with a complex language task - auditory verb generation. However, since language function may vary considerably in patients with focal lesions, it is important to optimize MEGI for estimation of language function with other simpler language tasks. The goal of this study was to optimize MEGI laterality analyses for two such simpler language tasks that can have compliance from those with impaired language function: a non-word repetition (NWR) task and a picture naming (PN) task. Language lateralization results for these two tasks were compared to the verb-generation (VG) task. MEGI reconstruction parameters (regions and time windows) for NWR and PN were first defined in a presurgical training cohort by benchmarking these against laterality indices for VG. Optimized time windows and regions of interest (ROIs) for NWR and PN were determined by examining oscillations in the beta band (12-30 Hz) a marker of neural activity known to be concordant with the VG laterality index (LI). For NWR, additional ROIs include areas MTG/ITG and for both NWR and PN, the postcentral gyrus was included in analyses. Optimal time windows for NWR were defined as 650-850 ms (stimulus-locked) and -350 to -150 ms (response-locked) and for PN -450 to -250 ms (response-locked). To verify the optimal parameters defined in our training cohort for NWR and PN, we examined an independent validation cohort (n = 30 for NWR, n = 28 for PN) and found high concordance between VG laterality and PN laterality (82%) and between VG laterality and NWR laterality (87%). Finally, in a test cohort (n = 8) that underwent both the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) test and MEG for VG, NWR, and PN, we identified excellent concordance (100%) with IAP for VG + NWR + PN composite LI, high concordance for PN alone (87.5%), and moderate concordance for NWR alone (66.7%). These findings provide task options for non-invasive language mapping with MEGI that can be calibrated for language abilities of individual patients. Results also demonstrate that more accurate estimates can be obtained by combining laterality estimates obtained from multiple tasks. MEGI		[Hinkley, Leighton B.

In order to understand fully the potential risk that medical use of prescription drugs conveys for nonmedical use of prescription drugs, the current study explored (a) the simultaneous associations between the medical use of several classes of prescription drugs with current nonmedical use of the same and other prescription drug classes, and (b) whether the associations depended upon past or current medical use.Methods: Data came from a cross-sectional survey of 1686 college students, which assessed past and current medical use and current nonmedical use of stimulants, sedatives/anxiolytics, and opioid analgesics. Results: Logistic regression analyses revealed that both past and current medical use of sedatives/anxiolytics and opioid analgesics predicted the current nonmedical use of the same drug class, whereas past medical use of stimulants predicted the current nonmedical use of stimulants. In addition, current medical use of stimulants predicted current nonmedical use of sedatives/anxiolytics and past medical use of sedatives/anxiolytics predicted current nonmedical use of opioid analgesics.Conclusions: This study provides a broader examination than past research of simultaneous same-drug class and cross-drug class associations between medical and nonmedical prescription drug use, as well as the role of past and current medical use in these associations. Overall, the results suggest that efforts to prevent nonmedical use of a prescription drug class should move beyond targeting only those who have or who are using the same drug class medically.

Applying this theory to younger adolescents offers the possibility of investigating potentially malleable prevention and intervention targets. Objectives: The current study examines the role of perceived availability and engagement in structured and unstructured activities on adolescent alcohol and marijuana use controlling for substance availability. Methods: Data were collected as part of a longitudinal study of 6th-8th graders (N = 1023; 52% female; 76% White; M-age = 12.23 years). Multiple logistic regressions analyzed the impact of availability and engagement in structured and unstructured activities at Wave 1 on heavy drinking and marijuana use by study end in both unadjusted and adjusted models. Results: Availability of unstructured activities was associated with increased likelihood of both marijuana use (b* = .06, p = .04) and heavy drinking (OR = 1.20, p < .001), while availability of structured activities was not significantly associated with likelihood of either marijuana use (b* = -.10, p = .07) or heavy drinking (OR = 0.86, p = .16). Engagement in unstructured activities was significantly associated with increased likelihood of both marijuana use (b* = .06, p = .03) and heavy drinking (OR = 1.11, p = .003), while engagement in structured activities was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of both marijuana use (b* = -.25, p < .001) and heavy drinking (OR = 0.85, p = .046). Conclusions: Perceived availability of and engagement in unstructured activities may present a risk, while perceived availability of and engagement in structured activities may serve as a protective factor for youth substance use.

Objectives: Our aim was to search for factors associated with both continued abstinence and attempting to quit among low-income disabled smokers. Methods: From the French national smoking cessation cohort CDT-net, we included 1624 adults living with disability pension or disabled adult allowance. Our dependent variables (abstainers, attempting to quit among non-abstainers) were used in logistic regressions. Continued abstinence was defined as self-reports of no smoking for more than 28 days and attempting to quit was defined as self-reports of no smoking for less than 28 days; both validated with carbon monoxide < 10 ppm. Results: The average age was 48.5 years, with a predominance of men (55.5%). Achieved continued abstinence was 29.9% and was positively associated with age >= 55, history of previous attempts, low-dependence, and number of consultations during follow-up (all p < .05). Depression history, anxiety symptoms and cannabis use were negatively associated with continued abstinence (p < .05). Quit attempts were associated with lower dependence and number of consultations during follow-up. Pharmacological treatments prescribed at inception did not contribute to improve continued abstinence rates but varenicline was found to increase quit attempts unless the number of prescriptions was scarce. Conclusion: Even among low-income disabled smokers, achieving continued abstinence and attempting to quit could be promoted with similar predictors than among affluent smokers. Treatment of anxiety symptoms and specific support for smokers with a depression history could be included in the follow-up of quit attempts.

Objective: To establish the opinions of expert clinicians on how emergence is determined in practice. Methods: An online survey was completed by clinicians working in specialist rehabilitation settings across the UK. Questions were asked about diagnosis and confidence, informal assessment, formal assessment, and family involvement. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse responses to closed questions. Responses to open questions were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seventy-five surveys were analysed. Approximately a third (30.4 %) used tasks other than those recommended to determine emergence. A lack of confidence in tasks to detect the return of functional communication was reported by 46.4%. The majority (78.6%) reported they worked with patients who they felt had emerged, but could not demonstrate it based on the current criteria. A range of stimuli were employed, but 30.6% of respondents were not confident they could choose stimuli appropriately. Respondents reported a range of benefits and challenges when involving family in assessment.

Yet, the acquisition of individual structural magnetic resonance images (MRIindividual) is a time-consuming, expensive, and not feasible prerequisite in all subjects for spatial tracking and anatomical guidance in nTMS studies. We hypothesize that spatial transformation can be used to adjust MRI templates to individual head shapes (MRIwarped) and that TMS parameters do not differ between nTMS using MRI(individual)or MRIwarped. Materials and Methods: Twenty identical TMS sessions, each including four different navigation conditions, were conducted in 10 healthy subjects (one female, 27.4 +/- 3.8 years), i.e., twice per subject by two researchers to additionally assess interrater reliabilities. MRI(individual)were acquired for all subjects. MRI(warped)were obtained through the spatial transformation of a template MRI following a 5-, 9-and 36-point head surface registration (MRIwarped_5, MRIwarped_9, MRIwarped_36). Stimulation hotspot locations, resting motor threshold (RMT), 500 mu V motor threshold (500 mu V-MT), and mean absolute motor evoked potential difference (MAD) of primary motor cortex (M1) examinations were compared between nTMS using either MRI(warped)variants or MRI(individual)and non-navigated TMS. Results: M1 hotspots were spatially consistent between MRI(individual)and MRIwarped_36(insignificant deviation by 4.79 +/- 2.62 mm). MEP thresholds and variance were also equivalent between MRI(individual)and MRI(warped_36)with mean differences of RMT by -0.05 +/- 2.28% maximum stimulator output (%MSO;t((19))= -0.09,p= 0.923), 500 mu V-MT by -0.15 +/- 1.63%MSO (t((19))= -0.41,p= 0.686) and MAD by 70.5 +/- 214.38 mu V (t((19))= 1.47,p= 0.158). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of motor thresholds were between 0.88 and 0.97. Conclusions: NTMS examinations of M1 yield equivalent topographical and functional results using MRI(individual)and MRI(warped)if a sufficient number of registration points are used.

This prediction was derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance and its effort justification paradigm. Young adult participants (n= 82) engaged in multiple trails of a low or high effort task that resulted in a loss or reward on each trial. Neural responses to the reward (loss) cue were measured using EEG so that the event-related potential known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) could be assessed. Results revealed no significant differences between low and high effort conditions on the RewP. However, within the high effort condition, a more subjective experience of effort was associated with a larger RewP. This research extends past research on the effort justification paradigm of cognitive dissonance theory by suggesting that effort justification is associated with an implicit measure of reward valuation. It, therefore, challenges recent perspectives on dissonance processes that posit that these evaluative changes should only occur on explicit but not implicit measures.

The processing of emotional stimuli requires synchronization among different cerebral areas. This study characterized the cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) correlation in mothers from 11/2 to 3 months (PP1), 4 to 51/2 months (PP2) and over 61/2 months, postpartum (PP3) while observing two videos: one of a baby (BV) and one with sexual content (SV). EEGs were recorded from the frontopolar, dorsolateral and parietal cortices. All three groups rated the BV as pleasant, but only PP3 reported higher sexual arousal with the SV. While watching the BV, PP1 showed a higher correlation among all cortical areas; PP2 manifested a decreased correlation between the prefrontal and parietal cortices, likely associated with the lower emotional modulation of the BV; and PP3 presented a higher synchronization among fewer cortical areas, probably related to longer maternal experience. These cortical synchronization patterns could represent adaptive mechanisms that enable the adequate processing of baby stimuli in new mothers.

This study investigated the properties of the SDQ-P and its subscales in this population using Rasch analysis. One hundred and forty-three SDQ-Ps and 123 Impact Supplements were analyzed. Sixty-nine percent of SDQ-Ps were completed by female carers, 59% of young people were male, and 58% had Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). In this population the SDQ-P Total Difficulties Scale and the Conduct Problems subscale showed questionable construct validity. The individual subscales and Impact Supplement did not meet the criteria for reliability. Two items had disordered thresholds. The individual subscales showed mistargeting and 13-24% person misfit. Two items were significantly underdiscriminating. There was differential item functioning with age and time post-injury, and local dependence between subscale items. The Total Difficulties scale was multidimensional. The most easily endorsed items were in keeping with common symptoms of brain injury. These findings suggest the SDQ-P in its current form may not be a reliable and valid assessment measure for mental health difficulties in the paediatric ABI population and requires further investigation.

Moreover, it is not clear whether patients with eating disorders also exhibit diminished ability to accurately appraise their own empathic skills. We examine in AN and BN: (a) the impairments in various aspects of empathy and theory of mind (ToM), while accounting for the effect of other cognitive functions & xfeff;and (b) the accuracy of self-appraisal of empathy. Self-reported and performance-based empathy, ToM, and cognitive functions were assessed in 46 patients with AN, 30 patients with BN, and 42 healthy controls (HC). Both AN and BN patients reported diminished overall empathic abilities, whereas only BN patients reported reduced cognitive empathy compared to HC. Deficits in performance-based empathy were found in both patient groups. Cognitive ToM was impaired only in AN. Significant correlations between self-reported and performance-based empathy were found in BN and HC but not in AN. Cognitive deficits negatively affected the self-appraisal of empathy in AN but not empathic skills per se. Our findings highlight a double deficit related to empathic responding in AN: diminished performance and inaccurate self-appraisal of empathic abilities, indicating dysfunctional self-reflection.

Nevertheless, DSM-5 maladaptive personality domains showed mixed associations with AUD. Furthermore, no studies have explored the role of DSM-5 maladaptive personality domains on the comorbidity between AUD and different PDs. Objective(s): This study aims at investigating whether DSM-5 maladaptive personality dimensions could differentiate individuals with AUD from normative and healthy controls (HCs) subjects. The study also investigated relationships between these personality dimensions and AUD clinical features (i.e. onset, severity of concurrent substance use disorders), as well as their role in accounting for the comorbidity between AUD and PDs. Methods: This study administered the personality inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) to 99 treatment-seeking individuals (male 68.8%; female 31.2%; age: 48.12 (14.32)) with AUD (41 AUD only; 58 AUD with PDs), comparing the participants' levels of PID-5 domains with normative data and the data from a HC sample (N = 40; male 50%; female 50%; age: 48.12 (14.32)). Results: Disinhibition and negative affectivity were relevant maladaptive personality dimensions of AUD, even when controlling for the impact of PD diagnoses. Disinhibition and negative affectivity were associated to the onset of AUD and the severity of concurrent substance use disorders. The co-occurrence of AUD and PDs is related to other two domains, namely antagonism and detachment. Conclusions: AUD is a complex psychopathological disorder in which both externalizing and internalizing aspects determine relevant clinical features.

However, no studies have particularly targeted aversive prediction errors, despite the essential importance for the habenula in the field. Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process. Therefore, we examined habenula activation during a contextual learning task. We performed fMRI on a group of 19 healthy controls. We assessed the manually traced habenula during negative outcomes during the contextual learning task. The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were also administered. The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. There was also a positive correlation between TCI reward dependence scores and habenula activation. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.

Remote, Automated, and MRI-Compatible Administration of Interoceptive Inspiratory Resistive Loading								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						161	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00161			MAY 12 2020	2020	Research on how humans perceive sensory inputs from their bodies ("interoception") has been rapidly gaining momentum, with interest across a host of disciplines from physiology through to psychiatry. However, studying interoceptive processes is not without significant challenges, and many methods utilized to access internal states have been largely devoted to capturing and relating naturally occurring variations in interoceptive signals (such as heartbeats) to measures of how the brain processes these signals. An alternative procedure involves the controlled perturbation of specific interoceptive axes. This is challenging because it requires non-invasive interventions that can be repeated many times within a subject and that are potent but safe. Here we present an effective methodology for instigating these perturbations within the breathing domain. We describe a custom-built circuitry that is capable of delivering inspiratory resistive loads automatically and precisely. Importantly, our approach is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environments, allowing for the administration of complicated experimental designs in neuroimaging as increasingly required within developing fields such as computational psychiatry/psychosomatics. We describe the experimental setup for both the control and monitoring of the inspiratory resistive loads, and demonstrate its possible utilities within different study designs. This methodology represents an important step forward from the previously utilized, manually controlled resistive loading setups, which present significant experimental burdens with prolonged and/or complicated sequences of breathing stimuli.

Participants had to rate the likableness/pleasantness of the agents/behaviors. Behavioral results indicated that rating the likableness of the agent was mainly depended on the morally diagnostic character of the agent while rating the pleasantness of the behaviors was mainly depended on the moral valence of the behaviors per se. ERP results showed: 1) larger N1 was found in response to the agent consistently acting immorally, indicating an early detection of social threatening information. 2) Compared with agents who consistently act morally which provided no norm- or expectation-violation information, other conditions induced larger N400, indicating greater cognitive effort was recruited when the present moral information violated the participants' prior knowledge to the agent. 3) Increased LPP was found in response to the agent consistently acting morally (vs. moral behaviors acted by different agents), representing that people may allocate more attention to positive information during this stage. We suggest that this three-stage scheme is a common model when people encounter consecutive moral events.

Location-Specific Social Norms and Personal Approval of Alcohol Use are Associated with Drinking Behaviors in College Students								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1650	1659		10.1080/10826084.2020.1756849			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Prior research on risky alcohol use points to drinking norms as predictors of drinking behavior. Most research to date has only explored global (versus context-specific) drinking norms as they relate to general drinking behavior. To better understand risky drinking behavior in students, how norms may vary across drinking environments should be considered. Objectives: We sought to explore differences in drinking norms (descriptive and injunctive), personal approval, and alcohol use across specific drinking locations and how these location-specific predictors combine to best predict alcohol consumption in home/dorm locations, bars, and parties. Methods: College student drinkers (N = 115, 76% female) participated in an anonymous online cross-sectional survey in 2015-2016 assessing personal and perceived drinking experiences and attitudes across various locations. Results: Alcohol use, descriptive norms of alcohol use, and injunctive norms of alcohol use (but not personal approval) varied across location. In addition, location-specific descriptive norms were associated with alcohol use in each drinking location, whereas location specific personal approval was associated with alcohol use only at home/dorm and bar locations. Furthermore, descriptive norms and personal approval of drinking in a given location predicted alcohol use in that same location, while norms or approval for other locations did not. Conclusion/Importance: Results highlight the importance of specificity of perceived drinking norms and personal approval for predicting location-specific alcohol use. These findings have implications for interventions, which may benefit from discussions of students' preferred drinking locations and providing location-specific normative feedback.

Little research has examined the relationships between various peer pressure domains and emerging adult substance use. Methods: This study used quantitative data from 359 emerging adults (aged 18-29 years, M = 25.46 years; 60.8% female; 74.2% White) to explore the associations between different types of peer pressure (e.g. peer pressure to socialize and peer pressure to use substances) and substance use among a diverse sample of emerging adults. Latent profile analysis and path analysis were used for analysis. Results: Three unique profiles of perceived peer pressure emerged (negative peer pressure, positive peer pressure, and no perceived peer pressure). The negative peer pressure group was more likely to engage in binge drinking, lifetime alcohol use and lifetime marijuana use than the no peer pressure group. The positive peer pressure group was less likely to engage in lifetime alcohol or marijuana use compared to the no peer pressure group. Discussion: Findings suggest that peer pressure is associated with emerging adult substance use, in both negative and positive ways. Results of the current study provide the critical groundwork for more sophisticated studies seeking to understand the pathways by which positive and negative peer pressure impact emerging adult behavior.

We examined these sub-processes using reaction times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test (ANT) in control children, attentional problems (AP) children, and reading difficulties (RD) children. During the ANT, electroencephalography was measured using 128 electrodes on three groups of Finnish sixth-graders aged 12-13 years (control = 77; AP = 15; RD = 23). Participants were asked to detect the direction of a middle target fish within a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (center, double, or spatial), or without a cue, to manipulate the alerting and orienting sub-processes of attention. The direction of the target fish was either congruent or incongruent in relation to the flanker fish, thereby manipulating the inhibition sub-processes of attention. Reaction time performance showed no differences between groups in alerting, orienting, and inhibition effects. The group differences in ERPs were only found at the source level. Neuronal source analysis in the AP children revealed a larger alerting effect (double-cued vs. non-cued target stimuli) than control and RD children in the left occipital lobe. Control children showed a smaller orienting effect (spatially cued vs. center-cued target stimuli) in the left occipital lobe than AP and RD children. No group differences were found for the neuronal sources related to the inhibition effect. The neuronal activity differences related to sub-processes of attention in the AP and RD groups suggest different underlying mechanisms for attentional and reading problems.

However, existing works predominantly focus on performance-related measures for evaluating control systems as the subjective experience of a user by large cannot be directly observed. In this study, we therefore focus on agency-related interactions between control and embodiment in the context of physical human-machine interaction. By applying an intentional binding paradigm in a virtual, machine-assisted reaching task, we evaluate how the sense of agency of able-bodied humans is modulated by assistive force characteristics of a physically coupled device. In addition to measuring how assistive force profiles influence the sense of agency with intentional binding, we analyzed the sense of agency using a questionnaire. Remarkably, our participants reported to experience stronger agency when being appropriately assisted, although they contributed less to the control task. This is substantiated by the overall consistency of intentional binding results and the self-reported sense of agency. Our results confirm the fundamental feasibility of the sense of agency to objectively evaluate the quality of human-in-the-loop control for assistive technologies. While the underlying mechanisms causing the perceptual bias observed in the intentional binding paradigm are still to be understood, we believe that this study distinctly contributes to demonstrating how the sense of agency characterizes intuitiveness of assistance in physical human-machine interaction.

Objectives To analyze motor cortex excitability and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits' imbalance in patients with flaccid functional weakness. Methods Twenty-one consecutive patients with acute onset of flaccid functional weakness were recruited. Single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols were used to analyze resting motor thresholds (RMT) and intracortical inhibitory (short interval intracortical inhibition - SICI) and excitatory (intracortical facilitation - ICF) circuits' imbalance between the affected and non-affected motor cortices. Results We observed a significant increase in RMT and SICI in the affected motor cortex (p < 0.001), but not for ICF, compared to the contralateral unaffected side. Conclusion This study extends current knowledge of functional weakness, arguing for a specific central nervous system abnormality which may be involved in the symptoms' pathophysiology.

Objectives: To investigate the association between lifetime opioid dependence and adolescent self-perceived health, health beliefs (thinking there was a pill for everything), health behaviors (onset of alcohol use before 15, onset of prescription opioid use before 15) and parental health practices (having opioids in the family medicine cabinet at age 14, parental suggestions to take pills when sick). Methods: A sample of 343 community members who non-medically used prescription opioids in the past 12 months were recruited for the Prescription Drug Misuse, Abuse, and Dependence Study and retrospectively assessed for adolescent risk factors of lifetime opioid dependence (DSM-IV). Results: Logistic regression revealed the strongest predictor of lifetime opioid dependence was having a prescription opioid in the family medicine cabinet at age 14. Those who grew up believing there was a pill for everything and those who initiated alcohol use before 15 were 1.83 and 1.78 times as likely, respectively, to meet dependence criteria than their counterparts. Demographics and other adolescent predictors were not associated with opioid dependence. Conclusions: Findings suggest several adolescent exposures can be targeted to reduce opioid dependence. Through their behavior, parents can reduce their teens' risk for opioid dependence.

Promising mobile health (mHealth) approaches, such as smartphone (SP) apps, can be used in interventions to address or prevent excessive drinking. Method: The aim of the investigation was to examine the efficacy of a theoretically based mHealth SP app for alcohol intervention in two independent samples (N = 379): Mandated participants (Study 1) and voluntary participants (Study 2). Study 1 included a controlled trial with Mandated participants randomized into either an in-person Brief Motivational Interviewing BMI (n = 70) or BMI + SP app intervention (n = 71). Study 2 included Voluntary participants who participated in either a Control group (n = 157) or the BMI + SP app intervention (n = 81). Participants in both studies completed baseline and 6-week assessments. Results: In Study 1, peak Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of participants in the in-person BMI group had increased slightly at six weeks, while it had decreased for the app-based BMI + SP group. Study 2 participants using the BMI + SP app reported significant reductions in drinking and consequences; there were no changes in the (AO) Control group. Conclusions: The BMI + SP app was effective with both Mandated and Voluntary participants. Future testing with the BMI + SP app is needed to assess whether reach, adoptability, portability, and sustainability are greater with the mHealth smartphone app for alcohol intervention than in-person approaches.

However, to date, no study explored the neural underpinnings of infants' ability to bind emotion- to action-related information. To assess this issue, we measured EEG activity while 6-month-old infants observed the same action performed by an actress displaying three different emotional expressions (happiness, anger and neutral). Results have shown that actions embedded in an emotional context (happiness and anger) elicited larger early negativity at parieto-occipital sites compared to a neutral context. This finding suggests that already at 6 months of age, infants use information coming from facial expressions to detect the saliency and relevance of others' actions.

Factors Associated with Cessation or Reduction of Methamphetamine Use among Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men (gbMSM) in Vancouver Canada								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1692	1701		10.1080/10826084.2020.1756854			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Methamphetamine (MA) use among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) is a pervasive issue, associated with detrimental health outcomes. We identified factors associated with discontinuation or reduction in MA among a subset of gbMSM reporting frequent (at least weekly) use, with a specific focus on symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: We recruited sexually-active gbMSM aged >= 16 years in Vancouver, Canada into a prospective-cohort study using respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed study visits once every six months. We used generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with reductions in MA use following a visit where participants previously reported using MA at least weekly. Results: Of 584 cohort participants with at least one follow-up visit, 67 (11.5%) reported frequent MA use at baseline or in follow-up visits. Of these, 46 (68.7%) had at least one subsequent study visit where they transitioned to less frequent (monthly or less) or no MA use. In multivariable models, reduced MA use was less likely for those who spent >50% of social time with other gbMSM (aRR = 0.49, 95%CI:0.28-0.85), gave or received drugs in exchange for sex (aRR = 0.34, 95%CI:0.13-0.87), injected drugs (aRR = 0.35, 95%CI:0.18-0.68), or used gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) (aRR = 0.41, 95%CI:0.21-0.78). Symptoms of anxiety or depression were not associated with reductions in MA use. Conclusions: Social connection and drug-related factors surrounding MA use were associated with reductions, but anxiety and depressive symptomatology were not. Incorporating socialization and polysubstance-related components with MA reduction may help in developing efficacious interventions toward reducing MA use for gbMSM.

In the present study, we investigated the neural mechanisms of such processes using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Functional neuroimaging techniques may shed light on quick, automatic responses to stimuli that happen outside of conscious awareness and are thus increasingly difficult to quantify relying only on participants' self-reported experiences. They may further provide invaluable insight into physiological processes occurring in situations of sensitive nature, whereby participants-deliberately or not-may withhold their honest responses due to social desirability. Non-Muslim Western Caucasian participants watched short video clips of stereotypical Middle-Eastern Muslim males threatening their ingroup, offering reconciliation to the ingroup, or making a neutral statement. Threatening statements led to increased activation in the amygdala, insula, supramarginal gyrus, and temporal lobe. Reconciliation efforts led to increased activation in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and caudate. The results suggest that threat detection is a relatively automatic process while evaluating and responding to reconciliation offers requires more cognitive efforts. The implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.

Beyond physical entrainment: competitive and cooperative mental stances during identical joint-action tasks differently affect inter-subjective neural synchrony and judgments of agency								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	3			368	379		10.1080/17470919.2020.1727949			MAY 3 2020	2020	Little work has examined how mental stance alone, apart from physical entrainment, affects between-participant neural synchrony during joint social interaction. We report the first findings on how cooperative and competitive mental stances, even during identical visuomotor joint-action tasks, result in distinct neural oscillatory signatures in low beta and theta band between-participant phase synchrony. Two participants jointly controlled a cursor and were instructed to either compete or cooperate to move it to one of three targets. The visuomotor output was identical for both the compete and cooperate conditions because participants were privately given the same target for experimental trials. Cooperation enhanced theta band between-participant phase-locking value (PLV) midtrial at 1-2 seconds, reflecting activation of systems for social coordination to move the cursor in a shared direction. Competition enhanced low beta between-participant PLV, shifting from temporal to frontal regions, indicating that participants focused only on their target and later evaluated self-agency as winner or loser. This interpretation of the neural signature was corroborated by participants' greater post-trial ratings of the degree of control over the cursor during competition. Top-down cooperative and competitive mental stances shape perceptions of social context and affect interpersonal neural synchrony important for representation of self and others' actions.

Electronic Cigarette Use and Associated Risk Factors in US-Dwelling Pacific Islander Young Adults								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1702	1708		10.1080/10826084.2020.1756855			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: E-cigarette use is rapidly increasing among US young adults, heightening their risk for vaping-related illnesses. Yet, little is known about e-cigarette use among young adult Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI): an indigenous-colonized US racial group rarely described in research literature. This exploratory study provides the first known data on e-cigarette use and potential risk factors in NHPI young adults. Method: Self-report data were collected from 143 NHPI young adults (age 18-30 years) living in two large NHPI communities: Samoans in urban Los Angeles County and Marshallese in rural Arkansas. We assessed rates of e-cigarette, cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use, and positive and negative outcome expectancies from e-cigarettes, that is expected outcomes from e-cigarette use. To identify potential risk factors for NHPI e-cigarette use, regressions explored associations between participants' current e-cigarette use with current cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use, and e-cigarette outcome expectancies. Results: Among NHPI young adults, lifetime e-cigarette use rate was 53% and current use rate was 39%. Current rate of dual e-cigarette/cigarette, e-cigarette/alcohol, and e-cigarette/marijuana use was 38%, 35%, and 25%, respectively. In our regression models, current marijuana use and positive e-cigarette outcome expectancies were significantly associated with current e-cigarette use. Conclusions: E-cigarette use is common among NHPI young adults, exceeding rates for other at-risk racial groups. Marijuana use and positive expectations about e-cigarette use may represent potential e-cigarette use risk factors. Collectively, findings underscore the need for additional research to further explore the scope of, and risk and protective factors for, e-cigarette use in this understudied high-risk population.

Studies showed that religiosity serves as a protective factor, delaying the onset of alcohol use, and reducing the frequency of drinking. Few studies, however, have examined these associations with large, nationally representative samples, and even fewer have assessed the impact of religiosity on drinking behavior transitions/changes. Objectives: This study examined a national adult sample to investigate the associations between religiosity and alcohol use stages including initiation, reinitiation, and persistence of alcohol use. Methods: Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions Waves 1-2 were used. Wave 1 sample included 6113 nondrinkers, 6189 prior drinkers, and 21,950 current drinkers who were at risk for initiation, reinitiation, and persistent use of alcohol, respectively. Religiosity constructs included importance of religious and frequency of practice. Three logistic regressions examined the aforementioned associations. Results: Compared to those not attending religious services, the most frequent attenders exhibited lower odds of initiating alcohol use, reinitiation after prior use, and persistent drinking (ORs = 0.23, 0.51, 0.55, respectively; ps < .01). Those identifying religious beliefs as very important exhibited lower odds of initiation and reinitiation of alcohol use (both ORs = 0.63, ps < .05). Conclusions: Religiosity plays an important role in preventing/delaying alcohol use initiation, reinitiation, and persistence. Incorporating religiosity aspects (e.g. meditation) into alcohol prevention and control programs may serve to increase protective effects. Future studies should seek to delineate what religiosity factors can be leveraged and embedded into secular prevention programs delivered to youth and adolescents.

However, the latest Indian undergraduate medical curriculum does not require any competency in psychiatry to be fulfilled for certification of medical graduates as doctors. Thus, the role of Indian psychiatry teachers is quite challenging. Interestingly, there has been hardly any effort to understand the felt needs of psychiatry teachers that may further improve the quality of undergraduate training. Methods: We used a survey questionnaire that was both qualitative and quantitative, with questions on topics such as years of psychiatry training and experience as a psychiatry teacher. Do they feel the need for training in undergraduate psychiatry teaching? Do they require training in teaching psychiatry theory or clinics or both? What are the specific areas where they want training? What more should be planned for psychiatry teachers? Based on an online survey further steps in the direction of psychiatry teachers felt needs were initiated. Results: Around 55 responses with a response rate of 37% were received. More than 50% were working in medical colleges for the last 5 years. About 80% felt the need for further training to teach medical students while 97% felt that additional training is required for handling theory as well as bedside clinic. More than 60% were keen to attend a 1-day workshop to upgrade their teaching skills. A majority wanted to have a forum to share their experiences and to learn from others. Based on the felt needs of psychiatry teachers from the survey, a 1-day workshop was carried out and a forum for psychiatry teachers was inaugurated. Conclusion: Training of psychiatry teachers is an important felt need for the challenges that are unique to Indian medical education. The outcome from the Karnataka survey is a progressive step in addressing this challenge.

Limited studies have addressed the issues that affect the QoL in adolescents with cerebral palsy. The present study explores the parent-reported QoL in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Materials and Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, parental perspectives on QoL were investigated among 35 parents of adolescents with cerebral palsy, aged between 13 and 18 years. Performance on seven domains of QoL across age and gender were explored. Results: While the maximum QoL was seen in the domain of social well-being, the least QoL was noted for feelings about functioning. Across age, the early adolescence group (13-15 years) had a poorer quality of life in comparison to the late adolescence group (16-18 years). With respect to the gender, though females had a lower QoL scores, a statistically significant difference was observed only for the domain of general well-being and participation. Conclusions: From a parental perspective, the major issues of concern in adolescents with cerebral palsy were feelings about functioning, general well-being and participation, and access to services. This information will be useful when establishing management options or assessment protocols to improve their overall QoL.

The current study was undertaken to understand if having ASD contributed to a higher impact on families compared to other NDD and to understand additional factors impacting families of children with either disorder in a low-middle income country (LMIC) setting. Methods: Impact of ASD and other NDD along with sociodemographic factors was examined, by a retrospective analysis, among 540 children in a tertiary care center in South India. Results: Both ASD and NDD had high, but comparable, impact on the family. Being a girl child, having seizures, and having sleep problems predicted a higher impact. Conclusions: In children with NDD, managing co-morbidities such as achieving better seizure control and addressing sleep-related problems may improve the impact of NDD on the family. Gender disparity in disability needs to be studied within the local cultural context.

Emotion Dysregulation and Early Trauma in Borderline Personality Disorder: An Exploratory Study								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	3			290	298		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_512_18			MAY-JUN 2020	2020	Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) research is in its nascent stage in India though studies have estimated its prevalence in psychiatric conditions. Trauma experiences and emotion regulation difficulties are well documented in BPD in the international literature. Thus, it is imperative to examine the role of trauma experiences and their relation to emotion dysregulation in BPD in the Indian context. Materials and Methods: This study used both self-report and semistructured interview data from 34 adults with BPD who presented for outpatient or inpatient psychiatric treatment and compared them with a gender-matched control group. The tools used were the International Personality Disorder Examination, Kessler-10, Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form, modified-Positive And Negative Affect Scale, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Results: The BPD group reported higher negative affect, increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and a deficit of adaptive strategies, after depression scores were controlled for. General abuse, physical punishment, and emotional abuse were significantly higher in the BPD group. The high occurrence of childhood emotional abuse and negative affect in BPD patients emerged as a major correlate accounting for 68.4% of the variance in DERS scores. Conclusions: Although we obtained results similar to the western literature on BPD pathology, sociocultural factors such as family and economic conditions, cultural differences in symptom expression of BPD, and treatment forms used in India warrant further research.

The study aimed to develop a test to fill-up this gap. Materials and Methods: The study followed three phases: the construction of an assessment battery in both Bengali and English languages, separately, incorporating tasks on perceptual-motor, cognitive, language, and scholastic skills; doing a pilot study, and finally, standardization. Standardization was done on 91 normal children (NC) aged 4.5 to 9.5 years, from four districts of West Bengal. The test was applied to 57 children with poor school performance across various NDD, including specific learning disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and communication disorder. Binet Kamat Test (BKT) of intelligence, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) Index for specific learning disability (SLD), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Conner's Abbreviated Rating Scale- Parent Report, Linguistic Profile Test, and Test of Pragmatic Language were used as screening tools to identify children with various NDD. The psychometric properties of the tool were assessed. Results: The factor analysis suggested four-factor solution named scholastic-cognitive-motor, attention, auditory-verbal, and perceptual skill. The internal consistency of the test was found to be higher (Cronbach's alpha >0.70 for most tests), indicating high reliability. Discriminant validity revealed significant score differences between NC and children with NDD (P <.01), suggesting that the new tool can differentiate children with NDD from healthy NC. Conclusion: The results favor the new tool as a psychometrically strong tool to assess the scholastic backwardness of children with NDD. It may be further used to create specific profiles for different categories of NDD.

J	Snehil, Gupta; Sagar, Rajesh								Juvenile Justice System, Juvenile Mental Health, and the Role of MHPs: Challenges and Opportunities								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	3			304	310		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_82_20			MAY-JUN 2020	2020	Juvenile justice system (JJS) and the mental health of the juveniles involved in it are intricately related. Children in conflict with the law (CICL) and children in need of care and protection (CINCP) have a higher prevalence of mental health-and substance use related-problems, similarly, juveniles with mental health problems have a higher chance of coming in contact with JJS. Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 (JJ Act), with its latest amendment (2015), emphasizes the developmental well-being, including the psychological well-being of juveniles coming in contact with JJS and their social reintegration and rehabilitation. Mental health professionals (MHPs) can play a significant role in realizing this goal by contributing at all the levels: mental health promotion, preventing juveniles from coming in contact with JJS, treating juveniles in contact with JJS, and subsequent rehabilitation. Being well-versed in this area would also give a clinical and legal edge to the MHPs. Although JJ Act is a child-friendly law, its implementation in the real-world is faced with many practical challenges, which in turn limit or undermine the full legal, social, educational, and health benefits to the juveniles. The current viewpoint is aimed to highlight the important mental health aspects of juveniles involved with JJS with reference to the JJ Act (care and protection of children act, 2015) and the potential role that MHPs can play and discusses important challenges and road ahead.

J	Andrade, Chittaranjan								Nonfasting Lipid Profile May Suffice to Manage Dyslipidemia								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	3			316	317		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_178_20			MAY-JUN 2020	2020	Patients with major mental illness and especially those who receive antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemia is part of the metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and other diseases. A fasting lipid profile is traditionally ordered to determine the need for and to monitor lipid-lowering treatment. However, a recent study showed that fasting and nonfasting lipid levels, obtained from the same patients, almost identically predicted hard 3-year cardiovascular event risks; the risks with fasting and nonfasting levels were closely similar in various secondary analyses, as well. This supports the stance of major medical associations in the field to accept nonfasting lipid levels to guide the treatment of dyslipidemia in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease events.

Music add-on therapy is a method for treating mental disturbances. This study examines the effectiveness of music add-on therapy in managing children with behavioral problems. Methods and Materials: A randomized controlled design was adopted with a random allocation of 40 children (20 each in experimental and control groups) aged between 6 and 12 years with behavioral disorders as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-10. After the pretest, both the groups received treatment as usual (TAU), while the experimental group alone additionally received music add-on intervention with eight Hindustani ragas for 3 weeks. As clinical outcome measures, we used the Childrens Global Assessment Scale, Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form typical IQ (NCBRF-TIQ) version, and visual analogue scale (VAS) for a parent to monitor the behavioral improvement. Results: Children exposed to the music add-on therapy had improved score in the Children Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and the VAS as compared with the control group (F [2,76] = 34.307, P < 0.001 and F [2,76] = 72.4, P < 0.001, respectively). Further, the NCBRF-TIQ version revealed improvement in positive social behavior (F [2,76] = 13.089, P < 0.001) and reduction in problem behaviors in the experimental group. Conclusion: Music add-on therapy is effective in improving positive social behavior and reducing problem behaviors among children.

Stress and Coping Styles in Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	3			225	232		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_333_19			MAY-JUN 2020	2020	Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require well-balanced care and a comprehensive therapeutic approach. Mental health problems often go unnoticed in mothers of children with ASD due to the focus on training for the children. The presence of stress and depressive symptoms in mothers can interfere with the quality of care and therapy given to the child. The present study aimed to assess the quality of life, coping styles, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in mothers of children with ASD. Methods: This study recruited thirty mothers of children with ASD, to whom Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21), WHO Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF), and COPE Inventory were administered. Results: Results indicated the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and impaired quality of life among the mothers. Despite this, they exhibited positive coping styles. Conclusion: As part of a comprehensive intervention for children with ASD, there is also a need to address the psychological distress and coping styles of mothers.

Online Curriculum in Transplant Psychiatry								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	3			254	260		10.1016/j.psym.2019.12.006			MAY-JUN 2020	2020	Background: Transplant psychiatry is a subspecialty of consultation-liaison psychiatry that focused on evaluation, treatment, and research of mental health problems in organ transplant recipients and organ donors. To date, there is no literature about training programs that would ensure psychiatrists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills required to meet the clinical needs of these patients. Objectives: The author describes the implementation of an online curriculum in transplant psychiatry created at the request of physicians located outside the United States. Method: A 3session online interactive course focused on knowledge relevant to transplant psychiatry was held in the fall of 2018. While the instructor was based in the United States, all attendees were located in Pakistan. The impact of the course was evaluated via precourse and postcourse surveys assessing knowledge level, interest in transplant psychiatry, and level of comfort with transplant psychiatry evaluations in the pretransplantation and posttransplantation settings. Results: Nine participants attended at least one of the 3 sessions, and 6 attended all 3 sessions. There were no significant events regarding the implementation of the curriculum. The response rate to the questionnaire was 100% before the course and 88.8% after the course. Precourse and postcourse tests indicated the curriculum had a positive impact on the level of knowledge and level of confidence in addressing problems relevant to transplant psychiatry. Conclusions: Online curriculum for highly specialized areas of psychiatry is feasible and can have a positive impact on knowledge levels and confidence in addressing clinical challenges.

In pain disorders, the preoccupation with physical symptoms is associated with poor long-term outcomes. SSD may therefore be of use to identify and help chronic pain patients with particular needs. Objective: To test the hypothesis that in fibromyalgia, SSD is associated with higher anxiety sensitivity, health anxiety, and reactivity to pain, in addition to lower nonreactivity to inner experiences. In addition, to investigate if individuals with SSD report a larger impact of fibromyalgia core symptoms, more somatic symptoms, and higher psychiatric comorbidity. Methods: Using data from a clinical trial involving self-referred individuals with fibromyalgia, we compared participants with SSD to participants without SSD using t-tests and logistic regression. Results: Forty-nine out of 140 participants (35%) had SSD. Most findings corroborate that individuals with fibromyalgia who also meet criteria for SSD are worse off in terms of traits previously found to be predictive of a poor course in pain disorders. Post hoc analyses indicated that this could not be explained merely by a higher level of fibromyalgia core symptoms. Conclusion: SSD appears to be associated with a higher symptom burden in fibromyalgia, but further research is needed to draw firm conclusions regarding the reliability, acceptability, and utility of the SSD diagnosis in the clinic.

As this condition has only recently been recognized in the International Classification of Diseases (the 11th Edition), no empirical evidence exists about the underlying features and etiology of the disorder. Objective: To examine the neuropsychological and olfactory functioning of individuals with ORS and address whether there is central nervous system or sensory dysfunction associated with the condition. Methods: In this preliminary investigation, 9 consecutive participants with ORS completed a structured clinical interview and neuropsychological and olfaction evaluations. Results: A proportion of individuals with ORS displayed deficits in aspects of cognitive functioning (i.e., processing speed, executive functioning, recognition memory bias for ORS-related words), olfaction functioning (i.e., odor detection and discrimination), and emotional processing. Conclusions: Based on these preliminary findings of cognitive, olfaction, and emotional processing deficits in individuals with ORS, further neuropsychological and olfaction studies are needed that better characterize this understudied patient group and address this study's limitations.

Confronting the Crisis of Comorbid Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol -Related Liver Disease With a Novel Multidisciplinary Clinic								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	3			238	253					MAY-JUN 2020	2020	Background: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is prevalent and deadly and increasingly affects younger people and women. No single discipline is adequately equipped to manage its biopsychosocial complexity. Objectives: Depict the scope of the ALD problem, provide a narrative review of other integrated care models, share our experience forming and maintaining a multidisciplinary ALD clinic for over a year, and provide recommendations for replication elsewhere. Methods: Critical evaluation of clinic implementation and its first year of operation. Results: The clinical rationale for multidisciplinary ALD treatment is clear and supported by the literature. Such models are feasible although surprisingly rare and vulnerable to various surmountable challenges. Conclusions: Successful ALD clinics must be built by teams with solid personal and professional relationships, supported by institutional leadership, and must use a new kind of multidisciplinary paradigm and training. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is uniquely positioned to lead future efforts in the care and study of ALD.

Objective: Weaimed to investigate associations among anxiety, diabetes treatment adherence, and diabetes symptom control through child and guardian report. Methods: Cross-sectional pilot study surveying a convenience sample of children (ages 2-21) in a pediatric endocrinology clinic. Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition 2, Self-Care Inventory Report, and Pediatric Quality of Life measured anxiety, diabetes treatment adherence, and diabetes symptom control. Analyses were performed with Spearman correlations. Results: Prevalence of anxiety and related behaviors was higher when reported by children (13% and 24%) vs. guardians (5% and 13%). Child-reported anxiety was associated with worse symptom control in all ages (Pediatric Quality of Life [rs = 20.55, P, 0.01]) and worse treatment adherence in children aged #12 (Self-Care Inventory Report [rho = 20.601, P = 0.023]). Guardian- reported anxiety was associated with worse symptom control (Peds QL [rs = 20.38, P = 0.02]). Child- and guardian-reported anxiety were positively correlated (rho = 0.426, P = 0.017)-particularly for children aged.12 (rho = 0.686, P = 0.003)-although not significantly for children # 12 (rho = 0.201, P = 0.473). Conclusion: Anxiety in children with type 1 diabetes varies with the domain of diabetes management (treatment adherence vs. symptom control) and reporting source (child vs. guardian). Children aged #12 exhibited a stronger relationship between higher anxiety and worse diabetes management with worse treatment adherence and symptom control in the presence of higher anxiety. Guardians of younger children were less effective at recognizing symptoms. Challenges identifying anxiety and its detrimental effects on diabetes management suggest routine screening of anxiety in pediatric endocrinology clinics is especially salient.

The Rise and Fall of Alcohol Excise Taxes in US States, 1933-2018								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	3			331	338					MAY 2020	2020	Objective: Higher alcohol taxation is protective against alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. All states have specific (volume-based) excise taxes for alcohol that decrease if not adjusted for inflation. These taxes have diminished substantially in real terms since their inception after National Prohibition in the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in the magnitude and frequency of changes in state specific excise taxes to document their erosion. Method: Alcohol excise tax data were examined for all 50 states from 1933 to 2018. Tax data were obtained from the Alcohol Policy Information System, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, Wine Institute, and HeinOnline. Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted for beer, wine, and distilled spirits taxes to examine trends in the frequency and inflation-adjusted magnitude of changes in taxes from the year of alcohol tax inception. Results: From 1933 until 1970, beer, wine, and distilled spirits tax rates increased in value compared with inception rates, but by 2018 alcohol taxes had declined 66%, 71%, and 70%, respectively, compared with their inception values. The erosion of taxes after 1970 was driven primarily by declines in the magnitude of tax increases through the 1970s and 1980s, followed by declines in the frequency of tax increases in subsequent decades. Conclusions: The value of alcohol excise taxes has declined since 1970 from both insufficient tax increases and later infrequent tax increases. Laws that index rates to inflation could sustain the public health benefit of reduced morbidity and mortality resulting from higher alcohol tax rates.

J	Pettigrew, Simone; Jongenelis, Michelle, I; Jongenelis, Gregory; Pierce, Hannah; Stafford, Julia; Keric, Danica								Get Them Laughing to Get Them Drinking: An Analysis of Alcohol Advertising Themes Across Multiple Media in Australia								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	3			311	319					MAY 2020	2020	Objective: Efforts to develop and implement effective advertising regulations require a comprehensive understanding of alcohol promotion techniques used across a rapidly growing range of media platforms. The aim of this study was to analyze themes commonly used in alcohol ads in order to identify commonalities and differences by media type and the implications for existing regulatory frameworks. Method: In total, 628 Australian alcohol advertisements were coded according to media used for dissemination and themes known to be attractive to children and young people or problematic in other ways (humor, sport, mateship/friendship, manliness, value for money, buying in bulk, partying, sexual attraction, and adrenaline activities). Results: The largest proportion of analyzed ads belonged to the out-of-home category (41%), followed by the online category (27%), indicating the importance of ensuring that these media are appropriately covered by regulations. Overall, humor was the most common theme (present in 18% of ads), followed by value for money (14%), sports (14%), and bulk purchases (10%). Humor often co-occurred with other themes: 59% of ads with a sexual attraction theme, 40% of ads depicting mateship/friendship, 31% of ads depicting manliness, and 27% of ads with a partying theme also featured humor. Trends were evident in the types of themes most commonly used in ads disseminated via specific media, indicating that alcohol marketers are strategically selecting media platforms for particular themes. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that alcohol advertising controls need to cover all media, be clear in delineating inappropriate themes, and be adequately authorized to ensure compliance.

J	Hu, Xiaofei; Hisakata, Rumi; Kaneko, Hirohiko								Effects of stimulus size, eccentricity, luminance, and attention on pupillary light response examined by concentric stimulus								VISION RESEARCH				170				35	45		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.008			MAY 2020	2020	Previous studies show that the amplitude of pupillary light response (PLR) depends on the corneal flux density (CFD), which is the product of stimulus area by luminance. However, the contribution of CFD has been investigated only when the stimulus was centered on the fovea, whereas perceived luminance to pupillary response would reduce with stimulus eccentricity. Additionally, it has been shown recently that attentional state modulates pupillary response. In this study, we aimed to clarify the complete mechanisms of PLR by manipulating the stimulus size, eccentricity, luminance, and the participants' attentional states. We focused on four indices to examine PLR, that is, pupillary latency (PL), maximum constriction velocity (MCV), maximum constriction (MC), and mean pupil change (MPC). Results showed that PL was a function of CFD, whereas MCV, MC, and MPC were functions of both CFD and stimulus eccentricity. Furthermore, the magnitude of effect due to stimulus eccentricity for MCV and MC was different from that for MPC. These results provided new evidence that the different processing systems in PLR existed.

J	Sherk, Adam; Stockwell, Tim; Rehm, Juergen; Dorocicz, John; Shield, Kevin D.; Churchill, Samuel								The International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies: A New Method for Estimating Alcohol Health Harms With Application to Alcohol-Attributable Mortality in Canada								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	3			339	351					MAY 2020	2020	Objective: Data regarding alcohol-caused health harms are required by policymakers for setting health priorities. However, these estimations are currently resource intensive, and estimates vary substantially by method. Thus, many countries, states, and regions do not track these harms. We address this limitation through creation of the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP), an open-access alcohol harms estimator. InterMAHP consists of methodologies and program software designed to assist alcohol research teams in estimating alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity, by region. It is available at www.intermahp.cisur.ca. Application is illustrated through updated estimates of alcohol-attributable mortality in Canada. Method: Mortality counts and per capita alcohol sales were obtained from Statistics Canada. Drinking and bingeing prevalences were obtained from the Canadian Substance Use Exposure Database. InterMAHP automated the calculations of alcohol-attributable fractions (AAF) using the modern AAF formulation and a gamma distribution to specify the continuous prevalence distribution of consumption. Results: Alcohol is a leading driver of mortality in Canada. In 2016, more than 14,800 (95% CI [12,435, 17,127]) deaths were alcohol attributable, representing 5.5% of all deaths. This burden is borne disproportionately by men (79%). Among condition categories, cancer is the leading cause of alcohol-attributable mortality in both men and women. Conclusions: InterMAHP has the potential to assist public health researchers globally in estimating alcohol harms. This open-access software was used to estimate alcohol-attributable mortality in Canada, which was shown to be substantial. Policies proven to reduce alcohol consumption and related harms should be considered to reduce this burden.

While this bias has originally been assumed to reflect attentional capturing by the cue, its attentional nature has recently been questioned. To investigate the ARE's attentional properties, we recorded microsaccades as an attentional marker in the ARE paradigm. Microsaccades, small fixational eye movements performed during fixation, have previously been described to reflect the dynamics of spatial attention deployment. Our results favor an attentional explanation for the ARE: In trials in which an ARE was found, microsaccades were directed more often toward the cue, presumably reflecting the covert shift of attention. In contrast, more cue-incongruent microsaccades were observed in trials in which no ARE was found. Therefore, both repulsion as well as measured microsaccade modulations, are most likely an outcome of the preceding shifts of covert attention.

Method: The study enrolled 785 students from the baseline and first wave of a prospective cohort study developed at six high schools in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Conflict Tactics Scale-Form R (CTS-1), and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were used to identify childhood and adolescence physical abuse and alcohol misuse, respectively. Multigroup path analysis was performed to explore the postulated pathways between the exposures and outcomes. Results: Childhood physical abuse was a significant risk factor for alcohol misuse in adolescence for both sexes. Among girls, childhood physical abuse increased the risk of adolescent revictimization and school delay, which were mediators between childhood physical abuse and alcohol misuse. Among boys, childhood physical abuse has a direct effect on increasing the risk of alcohol misuse. School delay was also a mediator from more social determinants to alcohol misuse in both sexes, whereas not living with the mother in adolescence mediated such effects only among boys. Conclusions: Childhood physical abuse increases the risk of alcohol misuse in adolescence through different pathways in boys and girls. Strategies aimed at reducing alcohol misuse and other mental health problems in adolescence should incorporate such specificities.

J	Diez, Pablo Sanz; Schaeffel, Frank; Wahl, Siegfried; Ohlendorf, Arne								Accommodation responses following contrast adaptation								VISION RESEARCH				170				12	17		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.003			MAY 2020	2020	The current study explored the effects of contrast adaptation on the accommodation response (AR), using low- and high-pass filtered video clips as stimuli. Ten young myopic (mean +/- standard deviation: -2.91 +/- 1.36D) and 10 near emmetropic subjects (-0.19 +/- 0.14D) participated in the study. The AR was monitored under monocular viewing conditions using an eccentric infrared photorefractor. A 2-stage procedure was used: (1) the minimum spatial frequency content necessary to produce a proper individual AR; and (2) the AR was compared before and after adaptation to low-pass (s = -0.5), control (s = 0) and high-pass (s = +0.5) filtered videos. We found that (1) the average threshold Sinc-blur of both myopes and emmetropes necessary to evoke accommodation was (mean +/- standard deviation) lambda = 7.40 +/- 4.05 cpd. Myopes required a higher Sinc blur (average, 10.00 +/- 4.05 cpd) compared to emmetropes (average, 4.80 +/- 1.60 cpd). (2) Adaptation to low-pass filtered videos increased the AR by 0.41 +/- 0.33D in the myopic group and reduced it in the emmetropic group by 0.31 +/- 0.25D. Adaptation to high pass-filtered videos induced similar changes in both refractive groups (an increase of 0.41 +/- 0.40D and 0.46 +/- 0.29D for myopes and emmetropes, respectively). Our measurements show that the human AR can be modified by spatial frequency selective contrast adaptation although these were short-term effects. The perhaps most striking finding was that adaptation to low pass filtered videos had opposite effects on the AR in emmetropes and myopes. It remains to be studied whether these differences were a consequence of myopia or a contributing factor in myopia development.

J	Kypri, Kypros; Harrison, Sarah; McCambridge, Jim								Ethanol Content in Australian and New Zealand Beer Markets: Exploratory Study Examining Public Health Implications of Official Data and Market Intelligence Reports								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	3			320	330					MAY 2020	2020	Objective: The Anglo-Celtic colonists of Australia and New Zealand brought with them heavy beer-drinking customs, and each country later developed similar temperance movements and alcohol policies. Yet their beer markets differed throughout the 20th century; for example, Australian men typically drank lager with 5% alcohol-by-volume (ABV), whereas New Zealand men drank ale with 4%ABV. We investigated the public health implications of recent developments in product availability, marketing, and country-level consumption patterns. Method: We analyzed official data reporting beverage- and strength-specific volumes of ethanol available for sale in beer from 2000 to 2016, a period in which the countries had similar consumption trends; and did a thematic analysis of "market intelligence" reports. Results: Per capita ethanol beer sales fell in both countries, accompanied by increases in market share of higher %ABV categories. Different definitions of beer strength hampered comparison between countries. In Australia, consumption of ethanol in mid-strength beer (3.01%-3.5%ABV) increased, whereas consumption of low-strength beer (<3%ABV) decreased. In New Zealand, consumption of high-strength beer (4.351%-5%ABV) increased whereas that of traditional mid-strength beer (2.501%-4.35%ABV) decreased substantially. Market reports cited consumer health concerns and demand for "craft beer" (typically high-strength) as competing influences in both markets, and reduced-alcohol beer as "the alcoholic drinks industry's-potentially lucrative-shield against accusations of irresponsibility." Conclusions: Declines in both high- and low-strength beer in Australia have potentially important implications. In New Zealand, the failure of low-strength beer to establish significant market share, along with increased consumption of high-strength beer, are noteworthy developments. Trend data on product ethanol content warrants scrutiny in public health surveillance globally, whereas research is needed on the role of ethanol content within industry strategy.

Negative afterimages facilitate the detection of real images								VISION RESEARCH				170				25	34		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.005			MAY 2020	2020	Negative, or complementary afterimages are experienced following brief adaptation to chromatic or achromatic stimuli, and are believed to be formed in the post-receptoral layers of the retinae. Afterimages can be cancelled by the addition of real images, suggesting that afterimages and real images are processed by similar mechanisms. However given their retinal origin, afterimage signals represented at the cortical level might have different spatio-temporal properties from their real images counterparts. To test this we determined whether afterimages reduce the contrast threshold of added real images, i.e. produce the classic "dipper" function characteristic of contrast discrimination, a behavior believed to be cortically mediated. Stimuli were chromatic and achromatic disks on a grey background. Observers adapted for 1.0 s to two side-by-side disks of a particular color. Following stimulus offset, a test disk added to one side was ramped downwards for 1.5 s to approximately match the temporal characteristic of the afterimage, and the observer was required to indicate the side containing the test disk. The test hue/brightness was either the same as that of the afterimage or a different hue/brightness. The independent variable was the contrast of the adaptor. A dipper followed by masking was observed in most conditions in which the afterimage and test colors had the same hue or brightness. We conclude that afterimages are represented similarly to their real image counterparts at the cortical level.		[Kingdom, Frederick A.

Glycinergic and GABAergic interneurons shift the location and differentially alter the size of ganglion cell receptive field centers in the mammalian retina								VISION RESEARCH				170				18	24		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.002			MAY 2020	2020	By using the multi-electrode array (MEA) recording technique in conjunction with white-noise checkerboard stimuli and reverse correlation methods, we studied modulatory actions of glycinergic and GABAergic interneurons on spatiotemporal profiles of ganglion cells (GCs) in dark-adapted mouse retinas. We found that application of 2 mu M strychnine decreased receptive field center radii of GCs by a mean value of 11%, and shifted the GC receptive field (RF) centers by a mean distance of 28.3 mu m. On the other hand, 200 mu M picrotoxin + 100 mu M bicuculline+ 50 mu M TPMPA increased GC receptive field center radii by a mean value of 19%, and shifted the GC RF centers by a mean distance of 53.7 mu m. Glycinergic neurons in the mouse retina are narrow-field amacrine cells that have been shown to mediate ON-OFF crossover inhibitory synapses within the RGs' RF center, therefore they may increase the size and shift the location of GC RF center by synergistic addition to bipolar cell inputs to GCs. GABAergic neurons are wide-field amacrine cells and horizontal cells that are known to mediate antagonistic surround responses of GCs, and thus they decrease the GCs' RF center size. Our results suggest that a major global function of glycinergic and GABAergic interneurons in the mammalian retina is to provide the flexibility for adjusting the size and location of GCs' RF centers. The apparent shifts of GC RF centers suggest that the synergistic addition by GlyACs and the surround inhibition by GABAergic interneurons are not spatially symmetrical within GC RFs.

In addition, we sought to investigate trajectories for change of alcohol consumption. Method: This study was a randomized controlled noninferiority trial, between-groups parallel design, with a noninferiority limit of 50 g of alcohol per week. A total of 288 adults fulfilling ICD-10 criteria for alcohol dependence were randomized to treatment in primary care or specialist outpatient care at a university addiction clinic. The primary outcome was change in weekly alcohol consumption at the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were heavy drinking days, severity of dependence, consequences of drinking, psychological health, quality of life, satisfaction with treatment, and biomarkers. Trajectories were investigated using change in World Health Organization drinking risk levels. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis (n = 231) showed that the estimated weekly alcohol consumption in primary care was 18.2 g (95% CI [14.9, 51.3]) higher compared with specialist care (p =.28). Noninferiority was not demonstrated as the confidence interval exceeded the noninferiority limit. The secondary outcomes showed no differences between primary care and specialist care except that patients randomized to specialist care were more satisfied with treatment. The analyses of trajectories showed the main part of change in consumption occurred from baseline to the 6-month follow-up and was maintained to the 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: Although noninferiority could not be demonstrated, based on similar trajectories and sustained reduction of alcohol use, this study indicates brief treatment of alcohol dependence in primary care with the 15-method is a feasible and promising approach.

Nonlinear transduction of emotional facial expression								VISION RESEARCH				170				1	11		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.004			MAY 2020	2020	To create neural representations of external stimuli, the brain performs a number of processing steps that transform its inputs. For fundamental attributes, such as stimulus contrast, this involves one or more non-linearities that are believed to optimise the neural code to represent features of the natural environment. Here we ask if the same is also true of more complex stimulus dimensions, such as emotional facial expression. We report the results of three experiments combining morphed facial stimuli with electrophysiological and psychophysical methods to measure the function mapping emotional expression intensity to internal response. The results converge on a nonlinearity that accelerates over weak expressions, and then becomes shallower for stronger expressions, similar to the situation for lower level stimulus properties. We further demonstrate that the nonlinearity is not attributable to the morphing procedure used in stimulus generation.		[Gray, Katie L.

J	Sherk, Adam; Thomas, Gerald; Churchill, Samuel; Stockwell, Tim								Does Drinking Within Low-Risk Guidelines Prevent Harm? Implications for High-Income Countries Using the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	3			352	361					MAY 2020	2020	Objective: Many countries propose low-risk drinking guidelines (LRDGs) to mitigate alcohol-related harms. North American LRDGs are high by international standards. We applied the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP) to quantify the alcohol-caused harms experienced by those drinking within and above these guidelines. We customized a recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) analysis to inform guidelines in high-income countries. Method: Record-level death and hospital stay data for Canada were accessed. Alcohol exposure data were from the Canadian Substance Use Exposure Database. InterMAHP was used to estimate alcohol-attributable deaths and hospital stays experienced by people drinking within LRDGs, people drinking above LRDGs, and former drinkers. GBD relative risk functions were acquired and weighted by the distribution of Canadian mortality. Results: More men (18%) than women (7%) drank above weekly guidelines. Adherence to guidelines did not eliminate alcohol-caused harm: those drinking within guidelines nonetheless experienced 140 more deaths and 3,663 more hospital stays than if they had chosen to abstain from alcohol. A weighted relative risk analysis found that, for both women and men, the risk was lowest at a consumption level of 10 g per day. For all levels of consumption, men were found to experience a higher weighted relative risk than women. Conclusions: Drinkers following weekly LRDGs are not insulated from harm. Greater than 50% of alcohol-caused cancer deaths are experienced by those drinking within weekly limits. Findings suggest that guidelines of around one drink per day may be appropriate for high-income countries.

Many studies suggest that scene gist recognition can be achieved with only the low resolution of peripheral vision. Our study investigated the advantage of peripheral vision on central vision during a scene categorization task (indoor vs. outdoor). In Experiment 1, we used large scene photographs from which we built one central disk and four circular rings of different eccentricities. The central disk either contained or not an object semantically related to the scene category. Results showed better categorization performances for the peripheral rings, despite the presence of an object in central vision that was semantically related to the scene category that significantly improved categorization performances. In Experiment 2, the central disk and rings were assembled from Central to Peripheral vision (CtP sequence) or from Peripheral to Central vision (PtC sequence). Results revealed better performances for PtC than CtP sequences, except when no central object was present under rapid categorization constraints. As Experiment 3 suggested that the PtC advantage was not explained by a reduction of the visibility of the object in the central disk by the surrounding peripheral rings (CtP sequence), results are interpreted in the context of a predominant coarse-to-fine processing during scene categorization, with greater efficiency and utility of coarse peripheral vision relative to fine central vision during rapid scene categorization.

The possible use of precision tinted lenses to improve social cognition in children with autism spectrum disorders								VISION RESEARCH				170				53	59		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.007			MAY 2020	2020	A masked randomised control design compared the effectiveness of precision ophthalmic tints in improving the recognition of emotion in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Fourteen children aged 10-14 with ASD and 14 control children matched on verbal and non-verbal IQ, wore spectacles with coloured lenses to complete two tasks that involved the observation of coloured video sequences in which social interactions were depicted. On one occasion (randomly first or second) the coloured lenses provided light of a colour that the child had one month previously selected as optimal for the clarity of text. On the other occasion the lenses differed in CIE UCS chromaticity by 0.077. Performance in the ASD group was superior in both social interaction tasks with the lenses that provided the optimal colour of light.		[Ludlow, A.

J	Garcia, Christian C.; Lewis, Ben; Boissoneault, Jeff; Nixon, Sara Jo								Effects of Age and Acute Moderate Alcohol Consumption on Electrophysiological Indices of Attention								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	3			372	383					MAY 2020	2020	Objective: Despite increased attention to risks and benefits associated with moderate drinking lifestyles among aging adults, relatively few empirical studies focus on acute alcohol effects in older drinkers. Using electroencephalographic indices of early attention modulation (P1 and N1) and later stimulus processing (P3), we investigated whether acute alcohol consumption at socially relevant doses differentially influences neurocognitive performance in older, relative to younger, moderate drinkers. Method: Younger (25-35 years; n = 97) and older (55-70 years; n = 87) healthy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive one of three alcohol doses (placebo,.04 g/dl, or.065 g/dl target breath alcohol concentrations). Repeated-measures analysis of variance examined the effects of age, alcohol dose concentration, and their potential interaction on P1/P3 amplitudes and N1 latency during completion of a directed attend/ignore task. Results: Age-specific effects on P1 amplitudes varied by instruction set, with alcohol-associated decreases in amplitude among older drinkers in response to task-relevant stimuli and increases to irrelevant stimuli, F(2, 141) = 2.70, p =.07, eta(2)(p) =.04. In contrast, N1 analyses demonstrated alcohol-related latency reductions among older, relative to younger, adults, F(2, 83) = 3.42, p =.04. Although no Age x Alcohol interactions were detected for P3, main effects indicated dose-dependent amplitude reductions for relevant stimuli, F(2, 144) = 5.73, p <.01, eta(2)(p) =.08. Conclusions: Our results underscore the impact of acute moderate alcohol consumption on attentional functioning, highlighting age-dependent sensitivity in electrophysiological indices of early attentional processing. Given the import of attentional functioning to quality of life and increases in drinking among a rapidly expanding aging population, these findings have broad public health relevance.

J	Montgomery, LaTrice; Webb Hooper, Monica								Gender Differences in the Association between Marijuana and Menthol Cigarette Use among African American Adult Cigarette Smokers								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	8			1335	1342		10.1080/10826084.2020.1741633			MAY 1 2020	2020	Introduction: Despite the strong relationship between marijuana and tobacco use, especially among African American individuals and males, very few studies have examined the association between marijuana and menthol cigarette use. This study was designed to identify the prevalence of past month, past year and lifetime marijuana use and marijuana dependence among menthol and non-menthol cigarette smokers, as well as the association between marijuana and menthol cigarette use among African American female and male cigarette smokers. Methods: Data were drawn from 1,173 African American adult cigarette smokers in the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Results: Overall, 8.8%, 13.9% and 44.7% of African American menthol and non-menthol cigarette smokers reported past month, past year and lifetime marijuana use, respectively. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models revealed a significant interaction between gender and past month marijuana use on menthol cigarette use (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.21-2.42, p < .05). Past month marijuana use was associated with an increased odds of past month menthol cigarette use (relative to non-menthol cigarette use) among females, but a decreased odds of past of past month menthol cigarette use among males. Conclusions: When stratified by gender, marijuana use is differentially related to menthol cigarette use among African American adults. Given the prevalence of menthol cigarette use among this population, it is important to examine factors such as marijuana use that could be targeted in prevention and treatment interventions for African Americans, especially females, who are at risk for smoking or are currently smoking menthol cigarettes. Implications: This study found that marijuana use was associated with an increased odds of menthol cigarette use among African American females, while marijuana use was associated with a decreased odds of menthol cigarette use among their male counterparts. The impact of marijuana use on menthol cigarette smoking differs among females and males, highlighting the need for gender-tailored interventions that target marijuana use among African American individuals, especially females, who are at risk for smoking or are currently smoking menthol cigarettes.

Methods: This study utilized data derived from the U.S. division of the 2005-2006 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study, which include 7,084 U.S. 6(th)-10(th) graders (3,353 males and 3,731 females) in public and private schools. Results: The results showed that although some forms of involvement in bullying were associated with alcohol and marijuana use, some of these associations became non-significant when the social-ecological covariates were included in the models. The final logistic regression models revealed that being a traditional bully-victim increased the risk of alcohol use for males while being a traditional bully and cyber victim increased the risk of alcohol use for females. In addition, being a cyberbully increased the risk of marijuana use for males. While parental monitoring decreased the risk, delinquent peers increased the risk of both alcohol and marijuana use for both sexes. Parent/guardian support decreased the risk of alcohol use for females. The likelihood of alcohol use and marijuana use increased with age for both sexes, while being an African American was linked with a lower risk of alcohol and marijuana use among males. Conclusions/Importance: Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining the link between bullying involvement and substance use, together with social-ecological correlates for female and male adolescents.

J	Synigal, Shyanthony R.; Teoh, Emily S.; Lalor, Edmund C.								Including Measures of High Gamma Power Can Improve the Decoding of Natural Speech From EEG								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						130	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00130			APR 29 2020	2020	The human auditory system is highly skilled at extracting and processing information from speech in both single-speaker and multi-speaker situations. A commonly studied speech feature is the amplitude envelope which can also be used to determine which speaker a listener is attending to in those multi-speaker situations. Non-invasive brain imaging (electro-/magnetoencephalography [EEG/MEG]) has shown that the phase of neural activity below 16 Hz tracks the dynamics of speech, whereas invasive brain imaging (electrocorticography [ECoG]) has shown that such processing is strongly reflected in the power of high frequency neural activity (around 70-150 Hz; known as high gamma). The first aim of this study was to determine if high gamma power scalp recorded EEG carries useful stimulus-related information, despite its reputation for having a poor signal to noise ratio. Specifically, linear regression was used to investigate speech envelope and attention decoding in low frequency EEG, high gamma power EEG, and in both EEG signals combined. The second aim was to assess whether the information reflected in high gamma power EEG may be complementary to that reflected in well-established low frequency EEG indices of speech processing. Exploratory analyses were also completed to examine how low frequency and high gamma power EEG may be sensitive to different features of the speech envelope. While low frequency speech tracking was evident for almost all subjects as expected, high gamma power also showed robust speech tracking in some subjects. This same pattern was true for attention decoding using a separate group of subjects who participated in a cocktail party attention experiment. For the subjects who showed speech tracking in high gamma power EEG, the spatiotemporal characteristics of that high gamma tracking differed from that of low-frequency EEG. Furthermore, combining the two neural measures led to improved measures of speech tracking for several subjects. Our results indicated that high gamma power EEG can carry useful information regarding speech processing and attentional selection in some subjects. Combining high gamma power and low frequency EEG can improve the mapping between natural speech and the resulting neural responses.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						154	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00154			APR 29 2020	2020	Functional MRI is increasingly being used in the assessment of brain activation and connectivity following stroke. Many of these studies rely on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. However, the stability, as well as the accuracy of the BOLD response to motor task in the ipsilesional hemisphere, remains ambiguous. In this work, the BOLD signal acquired from both healthy and affected hemispheres was analyzed in 7-year-old children who sustained a Neonatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke (NAIS). Accordingly, a repetitive motor task of the contralesional and the ipsilesional hands was performed by 33 patients with unilateral lesions. These patients were divided into two groups: those without cerebral palsy (NAIS), and those with cerebral palsy (CP). The BOLD signal time course was obtained from distinctly defined regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from the functional activation maps of 30 healthy controls with similar age and demographic characteristics as the patients. An ROI covering both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was also tested. Compared with controls, NAIS patients without CP had similar BOLD amplitude variation for both the contralesional and the ipsilesional hand movements. However, in the case of NAIS patients with CP, a significant difference in the averaged BOLD amplitude was found between the healthy and affected hemisphere. In both cases, no progressive attenuation of the BOLD signal amplitude was observed throughout the task epochs. Besides, results also showed a correlation between the BOLD signal percentage variation of the lesioned hemisphere and the dexterity level. These findings suggest that for patients who sustained a NAIS with no extensive permanent motor impairment, BOLD signal-based data analysis can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of functional brain networks.

Despite the evidence for shared neural representations of self and others, less is known about the distributed processing within these common neural networks, particularly whether there are specific patterns of internode communication when focusing on other vs. self. This study aimed to characterize context-sensitive coupling among social brain regions involved in self and other understanding. Participants underwent an fMRI while watching emotional video vignettes of their romantic partner and elaborated on their partner's (other-condition) or on their own experience (self-condition). We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to quantify the associated changes in effective connectivity (EC) in a network of brain regions involved in social cognition including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate (PCC)/precuneus and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). DCM revealed that: the PCC plays a central coordination role within this network, the bilateral MTG receives driving inputs from other nodes suggesting that social information is first processed in language comprehension regions; the right TPJ evidenced a selective increase in its sensitivity when focusing on the other's experience, relative to focusing on oneself.

Changes in Cigarette, E-Cigarette, and Cannabis Use among US College Students Studying Abroad								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1683	1691		10.1080/10826084.2020.1756853			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Study abroad experiences among U.S. college students are risky environments for alcohol use; however little work has examined how studying abroad may affect other substance use. Purpose: This study assesses changes in frequency of cigarette, e-cigarette, and cannabis use among students studying abroad. Methods: We recruited study abroad students from 63 institutions who studied in the 12 most popular destinations; 2,086 students completed surveys before leaving the U.S. and during their last month abroad. Descriptive and multivariate mixed-effects regression analysis compared substance use by location between students and country natives using publicly available data, identified behavioral and demographic predictors of frequency of substance use abroad, and estimated average adjusted prevalence of substance use by location. Results: Students' cigarette smoking increased three-fold while abroad; patterns of use varied significantly by location and mirrored smoking behaviors of native young adults. Rates of e-cigarette use declined while abroad and rates of cannabis use were similar abroad to pre-departure rates. However, cannabis use varied substantially by location and were higher than native peer rates. For all substances, most frequent substance use abroad was reported among males and those with prior histories of single drug and polydrug use. Conclusion: Findings highlight the importance of continued research on drug use abroad among U.S. college students and pave the way for initial prevention and intervention efforts to target drug use abroad, particularly for cigarettes due to the negative health consequences of use and for cannabis given the potential legal ramification of use in non-legalized countries.

We show that precise voice imitation in a highly proficient and experienced vocal imitator, even in the absence of external auditory voice feedback, largely drew on internal cortico-subcortical auditory resources to control voicing errors based on imagined voice performance. Compared to the experienced vocal imitator, singers of a control group without experience in voice imitation used only sensorimotor feedback and demanding monitoring resources for imitation in the absence of voice feedback, a neural strategy that led, however, to a significantly poorer vocal performance. Thus, only long-term vocal imitation experience allows for the additional use of internal auditory brain resources, which result from training-induced brain plasticity, and which enable accurate vocal performance even under difficult performance conditions.

J	Nachshon, Ohad; Farah, Rola; Horowitz-Kraus, Tzipi								Decreased Functional Connectivity Between the Left Amygdala and Frontal Regions Interferes With Reading, Emotional, and Executive Functions in Children With Reading Difficulties								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						104	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00104			APR 28 2020	2020	Introduction Dyslexia is a reading disorder characterized by significant difficulty in reading, as well as reports of altered executive functions (EF). Children with reading difficulties (RD) experience a broad range of social and emotional problems. Recently it was suggested that children with RD have altered functional connections within the amygdala, which is related to emotional processing. Altered brain laterality related to reading was previously reported in children with RD. Hence, we sought to determine the differences in functional connectivity between the right and left emotional network as related to emotional challenges and the other reported difficulties in reading and EF in children with RD compared to typical readers. Methods Sixty-four 8 to 12 year old children, 27 children with RD and 37 age-matched typical readers, participated in the study. Reading, emotional, and EF abilities were assessed. Global efficiency of the emotional network was calculated and compared between the groups, and left vs. right functional connectivity of the amygdala was tested using the CONN toolbox. Functional connectivity measures were then associated with measures of reading, emotional, and EF abilities. Results Children with RD showed significantly decreased emotional and EF abilities compared to typical readers. A negative correlation between reading, emotional, and EF abilities was determined in both groups. Neuroimaging results showed decreased global efficiency measures within the emotional network in children with RD, who also showed lower functional connectivity between the amygdala and the left and right frontal pole regions. Results also indicated increased functional connectivity of the right vs. left amygdala with left and right pre-central and post-central gyri regions, which were related to decreased reading, emotional, and EF abilities in both typical readers and children with RD. Conclusion The positive relationship between EF and emotional abilities in children with RD strengthens the relationship between EF difficulties and emotional stress, which in turn may lower EF abilities (monitoring, inhibition, and attention) as well as decreased reading abilities. The emotional challenges in children with RD were associated with decreased functional connectivity of the left amygdala with pre/post central gyrus and cognitive-control regions. These findings suggest that although the right hemisphere is thought to be related to emotional stress, it was the decreased control of the left hemisphere that was related to emotional disturbance in children with RD.

Narrow-band noise, notched sound, and white noise have positive therapeutic effects on monotonous tinnitus. Considering the tonotopic characteristics of the auditory system and the spectral characteristics of these three masking sounds, the activation pattern of the auditory cortex and the mechanism of inhibiting tinnitus may be different. This study aimed to compare the activation patterns of three spectrally different masking noises and study the correlation between the masking effects and variational amplitude of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) in the corresponding cortical regions. We also assessed near-infrared spectroscopy brain function imaging (NIRS) as an objective assessment tool in acoustic therapy. Patients with persistent non-pulsatile tinnitus and control volunteers without tinnitus were enrolled in this study. The subjects were seated in a sound-proof room, with two optode arrays covering the bilateral temporal lobe. Auditory stimuli were presented; stimulation sequences followed the block design: different noises appeared randomly and repeated in five cycles. Tinnitus match and residual inhibition were performed in the tinnitus group. The data analyses were conducted using the NIRS_SPM toolbox. The group analysis results showed that the narrow-band noise caused a marginally significant decrease in HbO signal in the Brodmann 21 region (BA21), while white noise caused a significant increase in HbO signal in BA21. Notched sound did not cause significant changes in the HbO signal in the temporal cortex. And none of the three masking noises caused significant changes in the HbR signal in the temporal cortex. The depth of residual inhibition induced by the narrow-band noise and white noise significantly correlated with Delta HbO in the region of interest (ROI). However, neither the depth nor duration of the residual inhibition induced by notched sound correlated with the Delta HbO. Thus, NIRS showed three cortical activation patterns induced by three different masking noises, and correlations between residual inhibition effects and change of HbO amplitude were found. NIRS could therefore be applied in objective assessment of acoustic therapy.

Functional Use of Directional Local Field Potentials in the Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						145	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00145			APR 28 2020	2020	Background Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology aims to address the limitations, such as stimulation-induced side effects, by delivering selective, focal modulation via segmented contacts. However, DBS programming becomes more complex and time-consuming for clinical feasibility. Local field potentials (LFPs) might serve a functional role in guiding clinical programming. Objective In this pilot study, we investigated the spectral dynamics of directional LFPs in subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship to motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods We recorded intraoperative STN-LFPs from 8-contact leads (Infinity-6172, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, United States) in 8 PD patients at rest. Directional LFPs were referenced to their common average and time-frequency analysis was computed using a modified Welch periodogram method. The beta band (13-35 Hz) features were extracted and their correlation to preoperative UPDRS-III scores were assessed. Results Normalized beta power (13-20 Hz) and normalized peak power (13-35 Hz) were found to be higher in anterior direction despite lack of statistical significance (p > 0.05). Results of the Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated positive trends with bradykinesia/rigidity in dorsoanterior direction (r = 0.659, p = 0.087) and with axial scores in the dorsomedial direction (r = 0.812, p = 0.072). Conclusion Given that testing all possible combinations of contact pairs and stimulation parameters is not feasible in a single clinic visit, spatio-spectral LFP dynamics obtained from intraoperative recordings might be used as an initial marker to select optimal contact(s).

Past work suggests that dual use (i.e. use of both electronic and combustible cigarettes) is associated with greater rates of cannabis use, yet little is known about the nature of cannabis use among dual users. Objectives: The current study examined 414 adult dual users (48.3% female, M-age = 35.1 years), half of whom endorsed current (past month) cannabis use. Results: Results indicated that cannabis users reported more severe pain, greater pain interference, and more hazardous drinking. In addition, cannabis use was robustly related to hazardous drinking after statistically controlling for demographic and pain-related variables. Cannabis use was also associated with hazardous drinking indirectly via pain interference at greater levels of pain severity. Conclusions/Importance: These results highlight several clinical correlates of cannabis use among adult dual users, and also suggest that pain may play an important role in hazardous drinking among these individuals.

Studies investigating visual subliminal priming have shown that emotions are particularly able to modulate the affective judgments both at a behavioural and neural level. In this study, we investigated whether emotional unconscious learning is a core feature of human development, by testing infants as young as 3 months of age on a subliminal affective priming task, in which infants were primed with subliminal happy and angry faces (Experiment 1) or subliminal neutral and scrambled faces (Experiment 2), followed by two neutral objects. We found that arousal to the neutral objects - as indexed through skin conductance - changed when they were primed with faces displaying emotional valence, and particularly anger, but not when the face had a neutral expression. This change in physiological state only partially corresponded to a change in explicit behaviour - as indexed through looking times - suggesting that emotional unconscious learning likely influences explicit behaviour at later stages of development, when subcortical-to-cortical connections have strengthened.

High-Intensity Interval Exercise (HIIT) is a form of interval training that provides improved athletic capacity and has a protective effect on health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of swimming HIIT and Resveratrol supplementation on behavioral function in Novel object recognition and open-field tests in aged rats. Methods: A total of 45 aged male Wistar rats with an age of 20 months were randomly assigned into five groups of control (C), & xfeff;swimming HIIT (SW-HIIT), & xfeff;swimming HIIT with Resveratrol supplementation (SW-HIIT-R), Resveratrol supplementation (R), and solvent of Resveratrol supplementation (SR). There was also another group that included young animals (2-month-old) and was used to compare with older animals. Swimming HIIT and Resveratrol supplementation groups performed the exercise and received Resveratrol (10 mg/kg/day, gavage) for six weeks. Novel object recognition and & xfeff;open-field tests were used for evaluating the behavioral functions in animals. Results: The results showed that HIIT and Resveratrol significantly improved recognition memory compared to old animals. Moreover, it seems that HIIT and Resveratrol partly could modulate anxiety-like behaviors compared to old animals in the open-field test.

Hepatitis B Virus Infection among People Who Use Illicit Drugs: Prevalence, Genotypes and Risk Factors in the State of Amapa, Northern Brazil								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1633	1639		10.1080/10826084.2020.1756334			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Several records of high prevalence of HBV have been made in northern Brazil. Among risk groups for viral infection, people who use illicit drugs (PWUDs) stand out, especially if they inject drugs and engage in risky sexual behavior. Objectives: In this study, the prevalence, genotype distribution and factors associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure in PWUDs were estimated. Methods: This cross-sectional study used snowball sampling from nine different sites. Socio-demographic, economic, drug use and health-related information were collected of 308 PWUDs from nine municipalities in the state of Amapa, northern Brazil. Blood samples were tested for the presence of HBV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regressions were run to identify factors independently associated with HBV exposure. Results: In total, seventy (22.7%) PWUDs were exposed to HBV, and 12 (3.9%) had DNA HBV. Genotypes A (58.4%), D (33.3%) and F (8.3%) were identified. Age >= 35 years, use of injectable drug, daily use of drugs, use of drugs over 12 years, unprotected sex, exchange sex for money/drugs, and >12 sexual partners in the last 12 months were associated with exposure to HBV. Conclusions: This study identified important information on the epidemiological scenario of HBV infection in PWUDs, highlighting the high prevalence of HBV exposure and the urgent need for measures for control and prevention, especially vaccination against this hepatotropic virus.

Speech-Induced Suppression for Delayed Auditory Feedback in Adults Who Do and Do Not Stutter								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						150	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00150			APR 24 2020	2020	Speech-induced suppression is the normal, relative amplitude reduction of the auditory evoked potential for self-, compared to externally-generated, auditory stimulation. It remains controversial as to whether adults who stutter exhibit expected auditory modulation during speech; some studies have reported a significant difference between stuttering and fluent groups in speech-induced suppression during speech movement planning, while others have not. We compared auditory evoked potentials (N1 component) for auditory feedback arising from one's own voice (Speaking condition) with passive listening to a recording of one's own voice (Listening condition) in 24 normally-fluent speakers and 16 adults who stutter under various delayed auditory feedback (DAF) time conditions (100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms). We presented the participant's own voice with a delay, immediately after presenting it without a delay. Our working hypothesis was that the shorter the delay time, the more likely the delayed sound is perceived as self-generated. Therefore, shorter delay time conditions are proposed to result in relatively enhanced suppression of the auditory system. Results showed that in fluent speakers, the shorter the delay time, the more the auditory evoked potential in the Speaking condition tended to be suppressed. In the Listening condition, there was a larger evoked potential with shorter delay times. As a result, speech-induced suppression was only significant at the short delay time conditions of 100 and 200 ms. Adults who stutter did not show the opposing changes in the Speaking and Listening conditions seen in the fluent group. Although the evoked potential in the Listening condition tended to decrease as the delay time increased, that in the Speaking condition did not show a distinct trend, and there was a significant suppression only at 200 ms delay. For the 200 ms delay condition, speakers with more severe stuttering showed significantly greater speech-induced suppression than those with less severe stuttering. This preliminary study suggests our methods for investigating evoked potentials by presenting own voice with a delay may provide a clue as to the nature of auditory modulation in stuttering.

A prospective, interventional cohort design was used. For the main, impairment-based outcome measure (average visual search time), the within-subject control was affected vs. unaffected side. Four hundred and twenty-six participants who fitted the inclusion criteria completed all 4 time points (1200 therapy trials). We found a significant three-way interaction between therapy, side and group. Eye-Search therapy improved search times to the affected visual field of patients with either hemianopia alone or neglect and hemianopia, but not those with neglect alone. Effect sizes were moderate to large and consistent with previous studies. We found a similar significant interaction between therapy and group for the patient-reported outcome measure "finding things" that most closely matched the impairment-based outcome (visual search). Eye-Search therapy improves both impairment-based and patient-reported outcome measures related to visual search in patients with hemianopia alone or hemianopia and neglect.

FreeSurfer is one of the most frequently applied automatized software tools to study brain morphology. However, quality control of the outcomes provided by FreeSurfer is often ignored and could lead to wrong statistical inferences. Additional manual editing of the data may be a solution, although not without a cost in time and resources. Past research in adults on comparing the automatized method of FreeSurfer with and without additional manual editing indicated that although editing may lead to significant differences in morphological measures between the methods in some regions, it does not substantially change the sensitivity to detect clinical differences. Given that automated approaches are more likely to fail in pediatric-and inherently more noisy-data, we investigated in the current study whether FreeSurfer can be applied fully automatically or additional manual edits of T1-images are needed in a pediatric sample. Specifically, cortical thickness and surface area measures with and without additional manual edits were compared in six regions of interest (ROIs) of the reading network in 5-to-6-year-old children with and without dyslexia. Results revealed that additional editing leads to statistical differences in the morphological measures, but that these differences are consistent across subjects and that the sensitivity to reveal statistical differences in the morphological measures between children with and without dyslexia is not affected, even though conclusions of marginally significant findings can differ depending on the method used. Thereby, our results indicate that additional manual editing of reading-related regions in FreeSurfer has limited gain for pediatric samples.

Perspectives on Fentanyl Test Strip Use among People Who Inject Drugs in Rural Appalachia								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1594	1600		10.1080/10826084.2020.1753773			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Fentanyl-associated overdose fatalities have increased dramatically throughout the United States. Fentanyl test strips (FTS) may be used by people who inject drugs (PWID) to lower overdose risks; however, virtually no research has been conducted to understand the perspectives of rural PWID in Appalachia on FTS utilization. Objectives: We aim to explore FTS awareness and potential use among PWID in two rural counties in West Virginia (WV). Methods: Semi-structured interviews with PWID (n = 48) in two rural counties in WV were conducted to explore FTS awareness, potential use, and possible behavioral changes following FTS utilization. Participants were recruited in areas where PWID congregate in each county. With participants' permission, interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed using an iterative, constant comparative approach. Results: Very few participants had heard of FTS prior to the interview. Upon learning about FTS, PWID who reported frequently injecting heroin expressed high willingness to use FTS. Participants explained that learning their drugs contained fentanyl may make them more likely to engage in overdose risk reduction behaviors, such as: using less, doing tester shots, and not using the drugs entirely. Conclusion: Among our sample of rural PWID in Appalachia, most were unaware of FTS but expressed high willingness to utilize the technology. Participants described how receiving a positive FTS result may lead them to engage in overdose risk reduction behaviors. Augmenting existing overdose prevention initiatives in rural Appalachia such that rural PWID have access to FTS may result in reductions in overdose fatalities.

The objective of this work was to demonstrate positive relationships between reaching performance and grasping agency and motivate greater consideration of agency in movement rehabilitation. We hypothesized that agency and performance have positive correlation across varying control modes of the virtual hand. In this study, each participant controlled motion of a virtual hand through motion of his or her own hand. Control of the virtual hand was modified according to a specific control mode. Each mode involved the virtual hand moving at a modified speed, having noise, or including a level of automation. These specific modes represent potential control features to adapt for a rehabilitation device such as a prosthetic arm and hand. In this study, significant changes in agency and performance were observed across the control modes. Overall, a significant positive relationship (p < 0.001) was observed between the primary performance metric of reach (tracking a minimum path length trajectory) and an implicit measurement of agency (intentional binding). Intentional binding was assessed through participant perceptions of time-intervals between grasp contact and a sound event. Other notable findings include improved movement efficiency (increased smoothness, reduced acceleration) during expression of higher agency and shift toward greater implicit versus explicit agency with higher control speed. Positively relating performance and agency incentivizes control adaptation of powered movement devices, such as prostheses or exoskeletons, to maximize both user engagement and functional performance. Agency-based approaches may foster user-device integration at a cognitive level and facilitate greater clinical retention of the device. Future work should identify robust and automated methods to adapt device control for increased agency. Objectives include how virtual reality (VR) may identify optimal control of real-world devices and assessing real-time agency from neurophysiological signals.

A Meta-Analysis of Gray Matter Differences Between Bilinguals and Monolinguals								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						146	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00146			APR 23 2020	2020	Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter (GM) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of GM for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis. This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with bilingualism across the lifespan.

Through this observational study, we aimed to explore the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on the predictive value of these variables, as also whether any of them can predict the level of self-awareness once the cognitive rehabilitation is completed. 69 patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment, including self-awareness, at admission to and discharge from a cognitive rehabilitation process. Regression analysis was performed at these two moments and a third one was conducted to evaluate whether any of the variables at admission predicted the level of self-awareness at discharge. Verbal fluency was found to be the best predictor of self-awareness, both at admission and discharge. In addition, inhibition and cognitive flexibility, as well as episodic memory, appeared as significant predictors of post-rehabilitation self-awareness. Finally, verbal fluency was revealed as the unique pre-rehabilitation predictor of subsequent level of self-awareness following rehabilitation. While post-acute self-awareness is predicted by non-specific executive measures, the cognitive improvement putatively induced by neuropsychological rehabilitation reveals the contribution of more specific executive and memory functions. Importantly, pre-rehabilitation verbal fluency scores predicted the level of self-awareness after cognitive rehabilitation.

A few limited studies have reported that bilingualism may provide a limited buffer against age-related cognitive decline; however, others have not. The present study furthered this inquiry by analyzing the combined effects of age and language experience upon executive function in a geographically diverse online sample. Methods: Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to recruit a sample of younger (YA) and older adults (OA) from 24 countries. A total of 81 monolingual participants (YA = 37; OA = 44) and 82 bilingual/multilingual participants (YA = 43; OA = 39) completed task-pure executive function assessments of inhibition, memory updating, and attention switching. Results: YAs performed better than OAs on both the inhibition and updating tasks. On the attention switching task, a greater switch cost occurred when participants had less time to process a stimulus cue. Notably, no effects of language (i.e., bilingualism) were significant: no main effects or interactions with aging were found for executive function performance. Conclusion: The results of the present study challenge the claim that extensive experience with multiple languages can be a reliably protective factor against some normative age-related declines in executive function.

Data were collected via online surveys in Spring 2018. Wald chi-square tests assessed differences in ever and past 6-month opioid misuse by sexual orientation identity. Weighted adjusted logistic regression models estimated the influence of opioid-related attitudes (acceptance of misuse and risk perceptions) in relation to ever and past 6-month opioid misuse, controlling for demographic characteristics, other past drug use, and psychosocial variables. Results: Logistic regression models indicated that attitudes related to the acceptance of opioid misuse was predictive of (a) higher odds of ever misuse among heterosexual and bisexual individuals and (b) higher odds of past 6-month misuse regardless of sexual orientation. Conclusions: Prescription opioid misuse among LGB youth and young adults may be addressed by shifting key attitudes surrounding opioids. To help stem this deadly epidemic, prevention efforts should be guided by the unique stressors facing the LGB community and focus on reducing the acceptability of misusing opioids.

Neighborhood Deprivation Moderates Shared and Unique Environmental Influences on Hazardous Drinking: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Co-Twin Study								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1625	1632		10.1080/10826084.2020.1756332			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: There has been increased interest in the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of problematic alcohol use, including socioeconomic conditions of the neighborhood. Using a co-twin design, we examined the extent to which contributions of genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental influences on hazardous drinking differed according to levels of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. Method: Data came from 1,521 monozygotic (MZ) and 609 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs surveyed in Washington State. A measure of neighborhood deprivation was created based on census-tract-level variables and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test 3-item instrument was used to assess level of hazardous drinking. We tested a series of nested structural equation models to examine associations among hazardous drinking, neighborhood deprivation, and the variance components (genetic [A], shared [C] and unique environmental [E] influences) of these two constructs, testing for both main effects and moderation by neighborhood deprivation. Results: Neighborhood deprivation was significantly associated with increased hazardous drinking, after accounting for A and C variance common to both phenotypes. Adjusting for within-pair differences in income and education, neighborhood deprivation moderated the magnitude of variance components of hazardous drinking, with the variance attributable to shared environment and non-shared environment increasing in more deprived neighborhoods. Conclusions: Findings point to amplification of early childhood as well as unique adulthood environmental risk on hazardous drinking in areas of greater deprivation.

Existing studies on autonomy frustration mainly examined its effect in the primary thwarting context, ignoring its potential spillover to subsequent activities. In this study, we examined whether prior autonomy frustration would have a sustaining negative impact on one's motivation in another autonomy-supportive activity that follows. In this electrophysiological study, participants worked on two irrelevant tasks organized by two different experimenters. We adopted a between-group design and manipulated participants' autonomy frustration by providing varied audio instructions during Session 1. In Session 2, all participants were instructed to complete a moderately difficult task that is autonomy-supportive instead, and we observed a less pronounced reward positivity (RewP) difference wave and a smaller P300 in the autonomy-frustration group compared with the control group. These findings suggested that the negative influence of autonomy frustration is longstanding and that it can undermine one's motivation and attention in a following activity that is autonomy-supportive itself. Thus, our findings provided original neutral evidence for the adverse intertemporal effect of autonomy frustration, and suggested important practical implications.

However, such path integration changes have been less explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in early-stage AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesize that: (i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI; and (ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This cross-sectional study included early-stage VCI patients (n = 9), AD patients (n = 10) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality "Supermarket" task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the "Clock Orientation" test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric integration was not more impaired in AD compared to VCI. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia.

Independent contributions of social cognition and depression to functional status after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				31	6			954	970		10.1080/09602011.2020.1749675			JUL 3 2021	2021	Impairments in cognitive processing related to social understanding and communication (i.e., "social cognition") are well documented after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can contribute to negative functional outcome. Depression is also a common feature of TBI with detrimental functional consequences. We evaluated relationships between social cognition, depression symptom severity, and functional status in individuals with chronic TBI (>1 year post injury; n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30) using objective tests of social cognition as well as self-reported depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and functional status (Functional Behavior Profile). Results revealed significant relationships between depression and functional status across the sample, and relationships between social cognition and functional status specific to TBI. In the TBI group only, social cognition significantly predicted both overall and social functional status above and beyond depression. Group differences in functional status were independently mediated by social cognition and, especially, depression. Our findings suggest that social cognitive impairments and depression are distinct, functionally relevant TBI sequelae. Interventions to improve social functioning in this population may be most effective when contextualized within treatments for emotional disturbances.

J	Zhu, Hongyin; Zeng, Yi; Wang, Dongsheng; Huangfu, Cunqing								Species Classification for Neuroscience Literature Based on Span of Interest Using Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Model								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						128	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00128			APR 21 2020	2020	Large-scale neuroscience literature call for effective methods to mine the knowledge from species perspective to link the brain and neuroscience communities, neurorobotics, computing devices, and AI research communities. Structured knowledge can motivate researchers to better understand the functionality and structure of the brain and link the related resources and components. However, the abstracts of massive scientific works do not explicitly mention the species. Therefore, in addition to dictionary-based methods, we need to mine species using cognitive computing models that are more like the human reading process, and these methods can take advantage of the rich information in the literature. We also enable the model to automatically distinguish whether the mentioned species is the main research subject. Distinguishing the two situations can generate value at different levels of knowledge management. We propose SpecExplorer project which is used to explore the knowledge associations of different species for brain and neuroscience. This project frees humans from the tedious task of classifying neuroscience literature by species. Species classification task belongs to the multi-label classification which is more complex than the single-label classification due to the correlation between labels. To resolve this problem, we present the sequence-to-sequence classification framework to adaptively assign multiple species to the literature. To model the structure information of documents, we propose the hierarchical attentive decoding (HAD) to extract span of interest (SOI) for predicting each species. We create three datasets from PubMed and PMC corpora. We present two versions of annotation criteria (mention-based annotation and semantic-based annotation) for species research. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements in the final results. Finally, we perform species-based analysis of brain diseases, brain cognitive functions, and proteins related to the hippocampus and provide potential research directions for certain species.

The current study investigated the development of monetary and social reward processes in adolescents compared with that in children and adults; furthermore, it assessed whether adolescents had different levels of sensitivity to various types of rewards. Two adapted incentive delay tasks were employed for each participant, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that both monetary and social rewards could motivate response speed, and participants were more accurate under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The behavioral performances of individuals increased with age. For the ERP data, the cue-P3, target-P2, target-P3 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) components were investigated to identify reward motivation, emotional arousal, attention allocation and feedback processing. Children and adolescents showed higher motivation (larger cue-P3) to rewards than adults. Adolescents showed larger emotional responses to rewards; that is, they had larger target-P2 amplitudes than adults and shorter target-P2 latencies than children. Children showed stronger emotional reactivity for monetary rewards than for social rewards. All age groups had stronger attentional control (larger target-P3) under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The present study sheds light on the neurodevelopment of reward processes in children, adolescents and adults and shows that various reward process stages demonstrate different age-related and reward-type-related characteristics.

Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the BCI community due to its better generalization and feature representation abilities. However, most studies currently only have validated deep learning models for single datasets, and the generalization ability for other datasets still needs to be further verified. In this paper, we validated deep learning models for eight MI datasets and demonstrated that the cross-dataset variability problem weakened the generalization ability of models. To alleviate the impact of cross-dataset variability, we proposed an online pre-alignment strategy for aligning the EEG distributions of different subjects before training and inference processes. The results of this study show that deep learning models with online pre-alignment strategies could significantly improve the generalization ability across datasets without any additional calibration data.

To elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of the integration between the visual and vestibular cues in humans, we analyzed the cortical hemodynamic responses during sensory conflict between visual and horizontal rotatory vestibular stimulation using a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. The subjects sat on a rotatory chair that was accelerated at 3 degrees/s(2) for 20 s to the right or left, kept rotating at 60 degrees/s for 80 s, and then decelerated at 3 degrees/s(2) for 20 s. The subjects were instructed to watch white stripes projected on a screen surrounding the chair during the acceleration and deceleration periods. The white stripes moved in two ways; in the "congruent" condition, the stripes moved in the opposite direction of chair rotation at 3 degrees/s(2) (i.e., natural visual stimulation), whereas in the "incongruent" condition, the stripes moved in the same direction of chair rotation at 3 degrees/s(2) (i.e., conflicted visual stimulation). The cortical hemodynamic activity was recorded from the bilateral temporoparietal regions. Statistical analyses using NIRS-SPM software indicated that hemodynamic activity increased in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) and human MT+ complex, including the medial temporal (MT) area and medial superior temporal (MST) area in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, the subjective strength of the vertiginous sensation was negatively correlated with hemodynamic activity in the dorsal part of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in and around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These results suggest that sensory conflict between the visual and vestibular stimuli promotes cortical cognitive processes in the cortical network consisting of the TPJ, the medial temporal gyrus (MTG), and IPS, which might contribute to self-motion perception to maintain a sense of balance or equilibrioception during sensory conflict.

The electrodes may be external such as with electroencephalographic (EEG), internal extracortical such as electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical. Methods Most intracortical electrodes are placed close to the neuropil being recorded and do not survive years of recording. However, the Neurotrophic Electrode is placed within the cortex and the neuropil grows inside and through the hollow tip of the electrode and is thus trapped inside. Highly flexible coiled lead wires minimize the strain on the electrode tip. Histological analysis includes immunohistochemical detection of neurofilaments and the absence of gliosis. Results This configuration led to a decade long recording in this locked-in person. At year nine, the neural activity underwent conditioning experiments indicating that the neural activity was functional and not noise. This paper presents data on the histological analysis of the tissue inside the electrode tip after 13 years of implantation. Conclusion This paper is a singular example of histological analysis after a decade of recording. The histological analysis laid out herein is strong evidence that the brain can grow neurites into the electrode tip and record for a decade. This is profoundly important in the field of brain to machine or computer interfacing by implying that long term electrodes should incorporate some means of growing the neuropil into the electrode rather than placing the electrode into the neuropil.

Since speech is a collection of coordinated movements in the producing organs, observing and imitation of speech movements can stimulate these neurons. In addition, observing hand movements trigger some actions related to the verbal cortex in the network of mirror neurons. According to the hypothesis of mirror neurons, new therapeutic approaches, including IMITATE, have been proposed for patients with aphasia. In the present study, using the IMITATE programme, a new therapeutic approach called IMITATE-R was planned based on observation of oral movements, hand gestures, and imitation of oral movements. Afterward, the IMITATE and IMITATE-R methods were compared with each other on naming skills of two Persian people with aphasia. The results showed that the rate of benefit from each treatment in each client was proportional to its individual and linguistic characteristics; however, in both patients, the IMITATE-R method was more effective in improving the naming skill. The results of this study were aimed at confirming the hypothesis of mirror neurons and the use of methods are based on action-observation for the treatment of patients with aphasia.

Computerised cognitive rehabilitation is a promising option, but targeted training protocols are lacking and lab-based training can be demanding due to the repeated visits. This study tested the feasibility and efficacy of home-based computerised training targeting mainly WM updating in PD. Fifty-two cognitively well-preserved PD patients were randomised to a WM training group and an active control group for five weeks of training (three 30-min sessions per week). WM training included three computerised adaptive WM tasks (two updating, one maintenance). The outcomes were examined pre- and post-training with trained and untrained WM tasks, tasks tapping other cognitive domains, and self-ratings of executive functioning and depression. Home-based training was feasible for the patients. The training group improved particularly on the updating training tasks, and showed posttest improvement on untrained WM tasks structurally similar to the trained ones. Moreover, their depression scores decreased compared to the controls. Our study indicates that patients with mild-to-moderate PD can self-administer home-based computerised WM training, and that they yield a similar transfer pattern to untrained WM tasks as has been observed in healthy older adults.

However, no previous qualitative research has explored the experiences of individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI) receiving these interventions. The present study, therefore, aimed to explore how individuals with ABI make sense of their experiences of learning mindfulness skills. Six focus group interviews were conducted with 14 participants with ABI after they had completed an eight-week mindfulness group. The group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Four themes provided in-depth information about participants' lived experiences of mindfulness training and being in the group; "Developmental learning process", "Group as a supportive environment for learning", "Increased awareness" and "Benefits of mindfulness". The accounts capture participants' journeys through the process of learning mindfulness skills and implementing them in their everyday lives. The findings also suggested that most participants considered mindfulness beneficial in terms of helping them to cope with the emotional and cognitive consequences of ABI.

There is a growing body of literature that has explored the use of cognitive-focused interventions in PwMS, which aim to improve cognition-related function through drill and practice exercises, training in compensatory strategies, or a combination of the two. The current study aimed to expand upon previously published meta-analyses in this area, exploring the effects of cognitive-focused interventions on objective and subjective functioning in PwMS, as well as determining demographic and treatment-related factors that may influence intervention efficacy. Thirty-three studies, with a total of 1890 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. Outcome measures were categorised based on the domain they presumably assessed. For objective cognitive functioning, weighted effect-size analysis revealed small effects of cognitive-focused interventions on working memory (g = 0.31) and visual learning (g = 0.32). Small mean effect sizes were also noted on self-reported anxiety (g = -0.30) and depression (g = -0.23). Cognitive-focused interventions did not produce changes in subjective cognitive functioning. Moderating variables and clinical applications are also discussed.

Setting: Rehabilitation centre. Participants: Four patients with ABI with awareness problems. Design: A series of single-case experimental design studies with random intervention starting points (A-B + maintenance design). Main measures: Rate of trainer-feedback and self-control behaviour on everyday tasks, patient competency rating scale (PCRS), self-regulating skills interview (SRSI), hospital anxiety and depression scale. Results: All patients needed less trainer feedback, the change was significant in 3 out of 4. One patient increased in overt self-corrective behaviour. SRSI performance increased in all patients (medium to strong effect size), and PCRS performance increased in two patients (medium and strong effect size). Mood and anxiety levels were elevated in one patient at the beginning of the training and decreased to normal levels at the end of the training. The feasibility of the programme was scored 9 out of 10. Conclusions: The Socratic feedback method is a promising intervention for improving awareness of deficits in patients with ABI. Controlled studies with larger populations are needed to draw more solid conclusions about the effect of this method.		[Schrijnemaekers, Anne-Claire M. C.; Rasquin, Sascha M.

Yet few effective interventions are available for non-vocational activity. The aim of the study was to develop a new goal-directed intervention, the Programme for Engagement, Participation and Activities (PEPA), and evaluate its effect. The research design was a multiple-baseline design across behaviours, with direct inter-subject and systematic replications. Seven participants with sTBI, neurobehavioural impairment including apathy, inability to work, and limited leisure/social activities were categorised into two groups. Group 1 (n = 4) had cognitive impairments but were functionally independent. Systematic replication was conducted in a further three participants (group 2) with major neurobehavioural impairments and functional disability. Generalisation measures evaluated other life domains in group 1 participants (e.g., mood, community participation). Results of the weighted average Tau-U across the tiers was significant for six out of seven participants, with large effect sizes (>=.64) for five participants. Generalisation effects extended to other domains of life. The PEPA thus shows promise as an effective intervention to increase non-vocational activity and improve mental health outcomes in people with neurobehavioural disability after sTBI. These results add to the evidence for the effectiveness of goal-directed interventions.

Results from many single-case and multiple case studies as well as randomised controlled trials do not produce a clear picture of the efficacy of PA. We here tested a new method of PA, by inducing adaptation effects in the virtual reality. Healthy participants were attributed to one of four groups: no deviation, 10-, 20-, or 30-degrees rightward deviation. In contrast to classical wedge prisms, we induced the visual shift progressively. Participants performed two variants of the bisection and the landmark task to measure cognitive transfer of adaptation effects. Pointing error was directly related to the degree of optical deviation, and was greatest immediately following adaptation. Transfer was only observed in the bisection tasks, and only in the 30-degrees group. Due to the gradual induction of the spatial deviation the majority of participants were unaware of the adaptation effects. These findings show that large rightward deviation may affect sensorimotor performance in healthy participants similarly to neglect patients. Moreover, the finding that only participants adapted to 30-degrees showed biased bisection performance suggests that a critical threshold must be reached in order to induce significant visuomotor transfer.

The current study aimed to examine the association of agitation in PTA with the concurrent impairments in orientation and memory while controlling for covariates of agitation. Participants were 125 patients in PTA following moderate to extremely severe TBI recruited from an inpatient brain injury rehabilitation service who were assessed throughout PTA on the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS) and the Westmead PTA Scale (WPTAS). Agitation was observed in 42.4% of participants (ABS score > 21), with disinhibited behaviours (e.g., distractibility and impulsivity) most common. Multilevel modelling found daily ABS scores to be associated with daily scores on the WPTAS but in a non-linear pattern. Analysis of covariates found that shorter time post-admission, younger age, presence of infection and higher antipsychotic doses were associated with higher ABS scores. These results support a relationship between agitation and the concurrent cognitive impairment during PTA. While a causal link cannot yet be inferred, management strategies that can potentially interfere with cognition (e.g., sedating medications, environmental changes) should be used cautiously in case they exacerbate agitation.

This technique has been shown to reduce many signs of unilateral spatial neglect (USN). Two procedures of prism adaptation have been used. In concurrent exposure participants can see their arm and hand during the movement trajectory, and during terminal exposure, participants can see only the most distal few centimetres. Because the two exposures elicit different proportions of visual and proprioceptive realignment, they could present different rehabilitation efficacies. We compared these procedures in 12 USN patients and 12 healthy participants who performed one session of PA with concurrent exposure and one session with terminal exposure. We compared the effects of the two exposure types on sensorimotor outcomes (visual subjective straight ahead, proprioceptive subjective straight ahead, open loop pointing, and error correction during exposure) and neglect outcomes. We found no significant differences in the effects of the two exposure types on sensorimotor performance of patients and controls, nor on patients' neuropsychological outcomes. Compared with controls, USN patients showed a significant rightward bias in visual subjective straight ahead pre-adaptation, a slower rate of error correction during prism exposure, and some evidence that visual and proprioceptive shift could be influenced by their neglect. Based on these results, we recommend that prism adaptation be conducted with concurrent exposure for easiness of execution.

However, the dynamic time course of vicarious embarrassment remains unclear. We conducted an event-related potential (ERP) study to investigate the temporal dynamics of vicarious embarrassment and examine the role of perspective-taking in an emotional judgment task. The ERP results showed that vicarious embarrassment evoked more negative MFN (250-310 ms) and N400 (400-520 ms) components than the neutral condition over the frontal region. The time-frequency analysis results showed that, in the 200-1,600 ms time window, greater alpha power was elicited when participants imagined themselves rather than others in an awkward situation; in the 500-1,900 ms time window, for both groups, vicarious embarrassment involved greater theta oscillations than the neutral condition over the frontal region. These results extend previous findings that vicarious emotion involves mentalizing processes, and demonstrate that people first detect and evaluate the target's misconduct and negative outcomes and then experience the vicarious embarrassment.

Visual Feedback Modulates Aftereffects and Electrophysiological Markers of Prism Adaptation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						138	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00138			APR 17 2020	2020	Prism adaptation (PA) is both a model for visuomotor learning and a promising treatment for visuospatial neglect after stroke. The task involves reaching for targets while prism glasses horizontally displace the visual field. Adaptation is hypothesized to occur through two processes: strategic recalibration, a rapid self-correction of pointing errors; and spatial realignment, a more gradual adjustment of visuomotor reference frames that produce prism aftereffects (i.e., reaching errors upon glasses removal in the direction opposite to the visual shift). While aftereffects can ameliorate neglect, not all patients respond to PA, and the neural mechanisms underlying successful adaptation are unclear. We investigated the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300 event-related potential (ERP) components as candidate markers of strategic recalibration and spatial realignment, respectively. Healthy young adults wore prism glasses and performed memory-guided reaching toward vertical-line targets. ERPs were recorded in response to three different between-subject error feedback conditions at screen-touch: view of hand and target (Experiment 1), view of hand only (Experiment 2), or view of lines to mark target and hand position (view of hand occluded; Experiment 3). Conditions involving a direct view of the hand-produced stronger aftereffects than indirect hand feedback, and also evoked a P300 that decreased in amplitude as adaptation proceeded. Conversely, the FRN was only seen in conditions involving target feedback, even when aftereffects were smaller. Since conditions producing stronger aftereffects were associated with a phase-sensitive P300, this component may index a "context-updating" realignment process critical for strong aftereffects, whereas the FRN may reflect an error monitoring process related to strategic recalibration.

Truck drivers are vulnerable to driving violations, particularly because of their engagement in drug use. The use of AmED among these professionals remains unknown. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of AmED use and its association with driving violations among truck drivers. Methods: 684 drivers were recruited in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The use of drugs was reported. Drivers were split into three groups: (a) alcohol abstainers (AA); (b) alcohol-only users (AO); and (c) users of AmED. Intergroup comparisons were performed by polynomial logistic regression (the reference category was AO). We also performed Poisson regression analysis to obtain the prevalence ratio; the significance level was stipulated at 5%. Results: The prevalence of drivers reporting the use of AmED was 16.8%. Users of AmED (a) were younger, (b) were less experienced drivers, (c) had a heavier pattern of alcohol use, (d) used illicit drugs more frequently, and (e) had poorer sleep quality than AO subjects. A higher prevalence of drivers who had arguments or fights while driving (PR = 1.71) and of drivers who drove unbelted (PR = 1.66) ingested AmED than of AO subjects. Conclusions/importance: The use of AmED increased the prevalence of driving violations beyond the risks commonly attributed to alcohol use. We suggest additional investments in preventative measures based on the beverage category and a revision of the work organization of truck drivers to reduce their health and social risks.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of regular mephedrone intake with other psychoactive substances on the clinical picture of patients, including self-harms and suicide attempts. Methods: The study involved a group of 601 patients addicted to mephedrone who were admitted to a psychiatric hospital between 2010 and 2018 due to regular mephedrone intake. Results: There was a statistically significant relationship between sleep disorders and mephedrone combined with alcohol (p < .05) or cannabinols (p < .05). However, the highest number of statistically significant correlations was reported when mephedrone was combined with opioids. There was a growing year-on-year percentage of people who attempted suicide because of regular mephedrone intake (p < .001). The more psychoactive substances were combined with mephedrone, the greater the risk of attempted suicide (p < .01). 20% of the examined group were hospitalized several times. Among those hospitalized several times, significantly more people took more than one additional psychoactive substance (p < .01). Conclusions: The more psychoactive substances combined with mephedrone, the more clinical symptoms are associated with it.

A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in adult day care centres in Helsinki, Finland. Participants (N = 147) were older individuals with mild to moderate dementia living at home and attending day care (mean age 83 years, 72% female, 63% at mild stage of dementia). The intervention group (n= 76) received systematic CT for 45 min twice a week while the control group (n = 71) attended day care as usual. The cognitive and psychological outcomes were measured at baseline, and followed up at 3 and 9 months. No differences between the two groups in changes of any of the cognitive functions, or PWB over time were found. We observed a positive trend at 3 months in the change for PWB favouring the intervention group, but no significant interaction effect was found (p = .079;d = -0.31). Thus, systematic CT appears to have no effect on neuropsychological outcomes of cognitive functioning and PWB in older adults who already have dementia.

Music Form but Not Music Experience Modulates Motor Cortical Activity in Response to Novel Music								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						127	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00127			APR 16 2020	2020	External cues, such as music, improve movement performance in persons with Parkinson's disease. However, research examining the motor cortical mechanisms by which this occurs is lacking. Research using electroencephalography in healthy young adults has revealed that moving to music can modulate motor cortical activity. Moreover, motor cortical activity is further influenced by music experience. It remains unknown whether these effects extend to corticomotor excitability. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of novel music on corticomotor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a pilot study of healthy young adults. A secondary aim of this study was to determine the influence of music experience on corticomotor excitability. We hypothesized that corticomotor excitability will change during music conditions, and that it will differ in those with formal music training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous using single-pulse TMS in three conditions: (1) No Music, (2) Music Condition I, and (3) Music Condition II. Both pieces were set to novel MIDI piano instrumentation and part-writing conventions typical of early nineteenth-century Western classical practices. Results revealed Music Condition II (i.e., more relaxing music) compared to rest increased MEP amplitude (i.e., corticomotor excitability). Music Condition II as compared to Music Condition I (i.e., more activating music) reduced MEP variability (i.e., corticomotor variability). Finally, years of formal music training did not significantly influence corticomotor excitability while listening to music. Overall, results revealed that unfamiliar music modulates motor cortical excitability but is dependent upon the form of music and possibly music preference. These results will be used to inform planned studies in healthy older adults and people with Parkinson's disease.

J	Lin, Huiyan; Liang, Jiafeng; Liu, Ting; Liang, Ziping; Jin, Hua								Cue Valence Influences the Effects of Cue Uncertainty on ERP Responses to Emotional Events								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						140	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00140			APR 15 2020	2020	Individuals often predict consequences, particularly emotional consequences, according to emotional or non-emotional signals conveyed by environmental cues (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues, respectively). Some of these cues signify the consequences with certainty (i.e., certain cues), whereas others do not (i.e., uncertain cues). Several event-related potential (ERP) studies regarding non-emotional cues have suggested that the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events occur in both perception and evaluation processes. However, due to the limitations of previous studies, it is unclear what the effects of cue uncertainty would be in an emotional cue condition. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the effects of cue uncertainty are affected by cue valence (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues). To address these questions, we asked participants to view cues and then to view emotional (positive or negative) pictures. The cues either did or did not indicate the emotional content of the picture. In the emotional cue condition, happy and fearful faces were used as certain cues indicating upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and neutral faces were used as uncertain cues. In the non-emotional cue condition, scrambled faces outlined in red and blue indicated upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and scrambled faces outlined in green served as uncertain cues. The results showed that for negative pictures, ERP responses in a time range between 60 and 1,000 ms were shifted to a more negative direction in a certain condition than in the uncertain condition when the cues were emotional. However, the effect was the reverse for positive pictures. This effect of cue uncertainty was similar in the non-emotional cue-negative condition. In contrast, there was no effect of cue uncertainty in the non-emotional cue-positive condition. Therefore, the findings indicate that cue uncertainty modulates attention toward emotional events when the events are signified by emotional cues. The findings may also suggest that cue valence modulates the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events.

The temporal dynamics of abacus mental calculation are still unknown although some behavioral and neuroimaging studies have suggested a visuospatial and visuomotor neural process during abacus mental calculation. Therefore, this contribution aims to clarify the significant similarities and the differences between experts and novices by investigating calculation-induced neuromagnetic responses based on cerebral oscillatory changes. Methods: Twelve to 13 healthy abacus experts and 17 non-experts participated in two experimental paradigms using non-invasive neuromagnetic measurements. In experiments 1 and 2, the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes presented mental calculations and temporal frequency profiles during addition while examining multiplication tasks. The MEG data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) with an adaptive beamformer to calculate the group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes and their temporal frequency profiles in source-level analyses. Results: Using a group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes, we observed some common brain activities in both right-handed abacus experts and non-experts. In non-experts, we detected the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); whereas in experts, detected the bilateral parieto-occipital sulcus (POS), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left sensorimotor areas mainly. Based on the findings generated, we could propose calculation processing models for both abacus experts and non- experts conveniently. Conclusion: The proposed model of calculation processing in abacus experts and novices revealed that the novices could calculate logically depending on numerical processing in the left IPS. In contrast, abacus experts are utilizing spatial processing using a memorized imaginary abacus, which distributed over the bilateral hemispheres in the IFG and sensorimotor areas.

Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for "yes" and spatial navigation for "no") and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a "yes" and "no" answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants' answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants' physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (r = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only.

It has been widely examined in both behavioral and neuroimaging research, usually with the use of the many versions of the false-belief (FB) task. However, there is still not enough evidence from studies on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ToM mostly because of methodological limitations: lack of selectivity, mismatch of experimental and control tasks, and focusing on participants older than 6 years old. In the current study, we attempted to develop a computerized tool for ToM assessment suitable for both behavioral and neuriomaging testing in preschoolers. We designed a version of the classic change-of-location task with custom visuals and three fine-tuned conditions: FB, true-belief, and no-belief (NB). The usability of the task for further application in neurodevelopmental research was tested with three methods: first, behaviorally, with the use of a touch screen on a group of 75 children, followed by a functional MRI (fMRI) study on 13 adults, and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on 19 preschool children. In line with our expectations, on the behavioral level, our task elicited the all-or-none performance in preschoolers. There was also a progression of performance with age in the FB condition. On the neural level, we observed the activation of structures involved in the ToM brain network in response to our task in both adults and children. The results therefore suggest that our task can be a useful tool for studying ToM development and its neural underpinnings.

A recent study found that ARSG experts had superior visual selective attention (VSA) for detecting the location of a moving object that could appear in one of 24 different peripheral locations (Qiu et al., 2018), suggesting that ARSG experience is related to improvements in the spatial component of VSA. However, the influence of ARSG experience on the temporal component of VSA-the detection of an item among a sequence of items presented consecutively and quickly at a single location-still remains understudied. Using behavioral and electrophysiological measures, this study examined whether ARSG experts had superior temporal VSA performance compared to non-experts in an attentional blink (AB) task, which is typically used to examine temporal VSA. The results showed that the experts outperformed the non-experts in their detection rates of targets. Furthermore, compared to the non-experts, the experts had faster information processing as indicated by earlier P3 peak latencies in an AB period, more attentional resources distributed to targets as indicated by stronger P3 amplitudes, and a more flexible deployment of attentional resources. These findings suggest that experts were less prone to the AB effect. Thus, long-term ARSG experience is related to improvements in temporal VSA. The current findings support the benefit of video gaming experience on the development of VSA.

The Health Equity Through Aging Research And Discussion (HEARD) Study: A Proposed Two-Phase Sequential Mixed-Methods Research Design To Understand Barriers And Facilitators Of Brain Donation Among Diverse Older Adults Brain donation decision making among diverse older adults.								EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH				46	4			311	322		10.1080/0361073X.2020.1747266			AUG 7 2020	2020	Brain donation in studies on aging remains a critical pathway to discovering and improving preventive measures and treatments for Alzheimer's dementia and related disorders. Brain donation for research is almost exclusively obtained from non-Latinx Whites of higher socioeconomic status in the United States. Despite persistent efforts, it has been difficult to obtain consent for brain donation among diverse participants. Hence, our understanding of Alzheimer's dementia and related disorders remains incomplete. The purpose of this methodological paper was to propose and outline a two-phase sequential mixed-methods research study design to identify barriers and facilitators of brain donation among diverse older adults. The first phase will consist of qualitative focus groups using a three (participant minority status: African American, Latinx, or White of lower income) by two (participant brain donation decision: consented or declined) design. The second phase will include statistical analyses of quantitative measures of existing data representing categories of variables that may be associated with decision making regarding brain donation. Next steps must include conducting qualitative focus groups and subsequent data analyses, resulting in overarching themes. Afterward, qualitative themes will be operationalized using quantitative variables for statistical analyses. This proposed study design can provide the foundation for developing and implementing effective and culturally competent survey instruments, educational tools, and intervention strategies in an effort to facilitate brain donation among diverse older adults		[Glover, Crystal M.; Shah, Raj C.; Bennett, David A.; Wilson, Robert S.; Barnes, Lisa L.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, 1750 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Glover, Crystal M.; Wilson, Robert S.; Barnes, Lisa L.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1750 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Glover, Crystal M.; Bennett, David A.; Wilson, Robert S.; Barnes, Lisa L.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Shah, Raj C.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Glover, Crystal M.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, 1750 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Glover, Crystal M.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1750 West Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60612 USA								6							Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychology	WOS:000526342600001

Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants' individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, pi/2, pi, and 3 pi/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity.

In order to measure the stability of the swallow motor pattern during several types of alterations in afferent feedback, we assessed swallow during a conventional water challenge in four anesthetized cats, and compared that to swallows induced by fixed (20 Hz) and stochastic (1-20Hz) electrical stimulation applied to the superior laryngeal nerve. The swallow motor patterns were evaluated by electromyographic activity (EMG) of eight muscles, based on their functional significance: laryngeal elevators (mylohyoid, geniohyoid, and thyrohyoid); laryngeal adductor (thyroarytenoid); inferior pharyngeal constrictor (thyropharyngeus); upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus); and inspiratory activity (parasternal and costal diaphragm). Both the fixed and stochastic electrical stimulation paradigms increased activity of the laryngeal elevators, produced short-term facilitation evidenced by increasing swallow durations over the stimulus period, and conversely inhibited swallow-related diaphragm activity. Both the fixed and stochastic stimulus conditions also increased specific EMG amplitudes, which never occurred with the water challenges. Stochastic stimulation increased swallow excitability, as measured by an increase in the number of swallows produced. Consistent with our previous results, changes in the swallow motor pattern for pairs of muscles were only sometimes correlated with each other. We conclude that alterations in afferent feedback produced particular variations of the swallow motor pattern. We hypothesize that specific SLN feedback might modulate the swallow central pattern generator during aberrant feeding conditions (food/liquid entering the airway), which may protect the airway and serve as potentially important clinical diagnostic indicators.

J	Ayasse, Nicolai D.; Wingfield, Arthur								The Two Sides of Linguistic Context: Eye-Tracking as a Measure of Semantic Competition in Spoken Word Recognition Among Younger and Older Adults								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						132	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00132			APR 9 2020	2020	Studies of spoken word recognition have reliably shown that both younger and older adults' recognition of acoustically degraded words is facilitated by the presence of a linguistic context. Against this benefit, older adults' word recognition can be differentially hampered by interference from other words that could also fit the context. These prior studies have primarily used off-line response measures such as the signal-to-noise ratio needed for a target word to be correctly identified. Less clear is the locus of these effects; whether facilitation and interference have their influence primarily during response selection, or whether their effects begin to operate even before a sentence-final target word has been uttered. This question was addressed by tracking 20 younger and 20 older adults' eye fixations on a visually presented target word that corresponded to the final word of a contextually constraining or neutral sentence, accompanied by a second word on the computer screen that in some cases could also fit the sentence context. Growth curve analysis of the time-course of eye-gaze on a target word showed facilitation and inhibition effects begin to appear even as a spoken sentence is unfolding in time. Consistent with an age-related inhibition deficit, older adults' word recognition was slowed by the presence of a semantic competitor to a degree not observed for younger adults, with this effect operating early in the recognition process.

To date, the misdiagnosis level is around 30%. The aim of this study was to observe the behavior of UWS patients, during the administration of noxious stimulation by a Trace Conditioning protocol, assessed by the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) entropy. We recruited 13 Healthy Control (HC) and 30 UWS patients at 31 +/- 9 days from the acute event evaluated by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and Nociception Coma Scale (NCS). Two different stimuli [musical stimulus (MUS) and nociceptive stimulus (NOC)], preceded, respectively by two different tones, were administered following the sequences (A) MUS1 - NOC1 - MUS2 - MUS3 - NOC2 - MUS4 - NOC3 - NOC*, and (B) MUS1*, NOC1*, NOC2*, MUS2*, NOC3*, MUS3*, NOC4*, MUS4*. All the (*) indicate the only tones administration. CRS-R and NCS assessments were repeated for three consecutive weeks. MUS4, NOC3, and NOC* were compared for GSR wave peak magnitude, time to reach the peak, and time of wave's decay by Wilcoxon's test to assess the Conditioned Response (CR). The Sample Entropy (SampEn) was recorded in baseline and both sequences. Machine Learning approach was used to identify a rule to discriminate the CR. The GSR magnitude of CR was higher comparing music stimulus (p < 0.0001) and CR extinction (p < 0.002) in nine patients and in HC. Patients with CR showed a higher SampEn in sequence A compared to patients without CR. Within the third and fourth weeks from protocol administration, eight of the nine patients (88.9%) evolved into MCS. The Machine-learning showed a high performance to differentiate presence/absence of CR (>= 95%). The possibility to observe the CR to the noxious stimulus, by means of the GSR and SampEn, can represent a potential method to reduce the misdiagnosis in UWS patients.

Quantifying training success is typically accompanied by performance diagnostics including the assessment of sports-relevant behavioral and physiological parameters. Even though optimal brain processing is a key factor for augmented motor performance and skill learning, neurodiagnostics is typically not implemented in performance diagnostics of athletes. We propose, that neurodiagnostics via non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will offer novel perspectives to quantify training-induced neuroplasticity and its relation to motor behavior. A better understanding of such a brain-behavior relationship during the execution of sport-specific movements might help to guide training processes and to optimize training outcomes. Furthermore, targeted non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might help to further enhance training outcomes by modulating brain areas that show training-induced neuroplasticity. However, we strongly suggest that ethical aspects in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation during training and/or competition need to be addressed before neuromodulation can be considered as a performance enhancer in sports.

Relatively recent advances in neuroimaging technology have provided the ability to measure brain activity concurrently during active brain stimulation rather than after stimulation. The effects on brain activity elicited by tDCS during active tDCS reported by initial studies have been somewhat conflicted and seemingly dependent on whether a behavioral improvement was observed. Objective: The current study set out to address questions regarding behavioral change, within and between-participant designs as well as differentiating the effects on hemodynamic amplitude and baseline during active tDCS stimulation. Methods: We tested the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on anterior hemodynamics in prefrontal cortex during performance on a spatial memory task. Prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a wearable and portable neuroimaging technique that utilizes near infrared light to measure cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes non-invasively. There were two groups, one group (n = 10) received only sham stimulation and the other group (n = 11) received sham followed by anodal stimulation to right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. Results: Analyses revealed an increase in spatial memory performance following tDCS stimulation. This augmented performance was accompanied by changes to oxygenation (HbO-HbR) at the onset of the hemodynamic response in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left ventral medial prefrontal cortex. In these regions we also observed that stimulation improved neural processing efficiency, by reducing oxygenation and increasing performance from block to block. During and following tDCS stimulation, it was also observed that in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the relationship between performance and oxygenation inverted, from a negative relationship to a positive relationship. Conclusion: The results suggest that tDCS is predominately a mechanism for changing neurons propensity for activity as opposed to their strength of activity. tDCS not only alters the efficiency of task relevant processing, but also the nature in which hemodynamic resources are used during augmented task performance.

Associations between brain regions that relate to SES overlap with brain regions known to be sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Animal models demonstrate that PAE attenuates neural and cognitive benefits of early life enrichment. However, whether or not environmental factors related to SES are associated with brain development in youth affected by PAE remains unknown in humans. Methods T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in participants with PAE and compared to age- and sex- matched Controls (n = 197, 48% with PAE, 44% girls, 6.5-17.7 years old). General linear modeling was utilized to examine associations between SES and subcortical brain volumes for youth with PAE compared to Controls. Results Group by SES interactions were observed within the hippocampus (HPC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral diencephalon (vDC) (corrected p values <0.05), where positive associations (e.g., higher SES related to larger subcortical volumes) were observed within Controls, but not youth with PAE. Post hoc analyses examined associations between SES and brain volumes within each group independently, and revealed widespread positive associations among Controls (Amyg, HPC, NAc, Pallidum, Putamen, vDC), but not youth with PAE. Across both groups, larger subcortical volumes were related to higher cognitive performance. Conclusion Typically developing youth exhibit increased subcortical volumes with increased SES, and surprisingly, this relationship is absent in adolescents with PAE. Findings suggest that subcortical brain volumes are neurocognitively relevant in both groups. The present results expand our understanding of the impact of PAE on the developing human brain within varying environmental contexts, and may inform novel environmental interventions that aim to improve, in part, on-going disruptions in brain development among youth with PAE. Our study highlights novel complexities in the pursuit to understand SES-brain associations, as we provide evidence that SES matters for brain outcomes among typically developing youth, and possibly not as much on an already altered brain as a result of PAE.

In line with this general trend, inter-disciplinary approaches have been taken to automate the recognition of emotions in adults or children for the benefit of various applications, such as identification of children's emotions prior to a clinical investigation. Within this context, it turns out that automating emotion recognition is far from being straightforward, with several challenges arising for both science (e.g., methodology underpinned by psychology) and technology (e.g., the iMotions biometric research platform). In this paper, we present a methodology and experiment and some interesting findings, which raise the following research questions for the recognition of emotions and attention in humans: (a) the adequacy of well-established techniques such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), (b) the adequacy of state-of-the-art biometric research platforms, (c) the extent to which emotional responses may be different in children and adults. Our findings and first attempts to answer some of these research questions are based on a mixed sample of adults and children who took part in the experiment, resulting in a statistical analysis of numerous variables. These are related to both automatically and interactively captured responses of participants to a sample of IAPS pictures.

Elevated Thresholds for Light Touch in Children With Autism Reflect More Conservative Perceptual Decision-Making Rather Than a Sensory Deficit								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						122	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00122			APR 7 2020	2020	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often behaviorally hyper-reactive to light touch, but it is unclear to what degree this arises from a fundamental sensory difference vs. higher order systems for attention or emotion processing. Thus far, experimental findings for light touch detection are mixed, and few previous studies have independently considered sensitivity (the ability to discriminate signal from noise) and decision criterion (the overall response bias or tendency to answer "yes" or "no" in a detection task). We tested a large sample of children, adolescents, and adults with ASD (n = 88) and with neurotypical (NT) development (n = 59) using von Frey filaments to derive light touch thresholds at the palm. We calculated signal detection metrics for sensitivity (A(z)) and response criterion (c) from hit and false alarm rates. Both metrics exhibited significant group differences, such that the ASD group was less sensitive, but had a much more conservative response criterion. We used a best subset model selection procedure in three separate ordinal regressions for the whole group, adults, and children/adolescents. In all selected models, c was by far the most significant predictor of threshold, supplanting effects of diagnostic group that were significant in the baseline models. In contrast, Az was not a significant predictor of threshold in any of the models. Mean values of c were similar for adults with and without autism and for children/adolescents with ASD, but lower (more liberal) in neurotypical children/adolescents. This suggests that children with ASD exhibit a conservatism in their perceptual decision-making that differs from their NT peers but resembles that of adults. Across the sample, the value of c was significantly and positively correlated with age and with autism symptoms (SRS-2 total score), in addition to thresholds. The results of this study suggest that, rather than a sensory difference in detection of light touch, there is a difference in response bias such that children with ASD are more conservative/likely to report "no" if unsure, than their young NT peers. Future work should consider the implications of conservative response criterion in ASD for commonly used forced-choice psychophysical paradigms.

Cognitive Function Impairments Linked to Alcohol and Cannabis Use During Adolescence: A Study of Gender Differences								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						95	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00095			APR 7 2020	2020	Major neurocognitive changes occur during adolescence, making this phase one of the most critical developmental periods of life. Furthermore, this phase in life is also the time in which youth substance use begins. Several studies have demonstrated the differential associations of alcohol and cannabis use concerning the neurocognitive functioning of both males and females. Past and contemporary literature on gender-specific effects in neuroscience of addiction is predominantly based on cross-sectional datasets and data that is limited in terms of measurement variability. Given the importance of gender-specific effects in addiction studies, and in order to address the two above-mentioned gaps in the literature, the present study aimed to compare neurocognitive functioning of male and female adolescents in the context of cannabis and alcohol use, while employing a longitudinal design with multiple repeated measurements. Participants were 3,826 high school students (47% female; mean age, 12.7), who were recruited from 31 high schools in the greater Montreal area. Participants were requested to complete annual surveys for five consecutive years, from 7th to 11th grade, assessing their alcohol/cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning (working memory, delayed recall memory, perceptual reasoning, and inhibition control). The analytical strategy focused on the longitudinal association between each predictor (female, male) and each of the outcomes (domains of neurocognitive functioning). Multilevel linear models assessed the association of alcohol and cannabis consumption and the four domains of neurocognitive functioning. Results revealed a gender by within-subject interaction, suggesting a weaker effect of yearly fluctuation of cannabis use on working memory among males compared to females. Our findings suggest a different pattern of neurocognitive impairment of female and male working memory after using cannabis over the course of adolescence. Early initiation of cannabis use potentially results in more spatial working memory deficits in female adolescents. This may negatively influence young females' capacity in academic settings and lead to significant impairment in adulthood, which critically decreases the individual's quality of life.

J	Pandya, Samta P.								Older Adults Who Meditate Regularly Perform Better on Neuropsychological Functioning and Visual Working Memory Tests: A Three-month Waitlist Control Design Study with a Cohort of Seniors in Assisted Living Facilities								EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH				46	3			214	235		10.1080/0361073X.2020.1743951			MAY 26 2020	2020	Background: Neuropsychological functioning and visual working memory are vulnerable to age-related decline. This investigation examines the impact of meditation on the said outcomes for older adults in assisted living facilities. Older adults (N = 136) from four assisted living facilities in Mumbai and Pretoria were randomized into intervention and waitlist control groups. Method: The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was used as a screening instrument for recruitment (cutoff total index score = 86 +/- 4). RBANS, the Simple Object Span Test (SOST), and the Picture Span Test (PST) were used to assess the outcomes. The intervention group underwent a 90-day meditation training complemented with self-practice. Results: Posttest scores of the intervention group were higher. Older adult men, with college degree, middle class, widowed, in fair health, with no diagnosed psychiatric conditions, who attended at least 70 (out of 90) meditation lessons and who self-practiced at least 70 times, gained more from the meditation intervention. Intervention compliance had the strongest effect on posttest outcomes as well as sex and psychiatric morbidities. Conclusion: Meditation intervention needs some refinements for older adult women, with high school education, upper class, currently married, in poor health, with diagnosed anxiety/depression/drug dependence, who attended fewer meditation lessons and self-practiced infrequently.

Objectives: Using longitudinal data, we investigated whether perceived social support moderates the relationship between depressive symptoms and alcohol use among HIV-infected men who inject drugs in Vietnam. Methods: Data were collected from participants (N = 455; mean age 35 years) in a four-arm randomized controlled trial in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with 94% retention excluding dead (N = 103) or incarcerated (N = 37) participants. Multilevel growth models were used to assess whether: (1) depressive symptoms predict when risk of alcohol use is elevated (within-person effects); (2) depressive symptoms predict who is at risk for alcohol use (between-person effects); and (3) within- and between-person perceived social support moderates the depressive symptoms-alcohol relationship. Results: Participants reported high but declining levels of depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Participants with higher depressive symptoms drank less on average (B = -0.0819, 95% CI -0.133, -0.0307), but within-person, a given individual was more likely to drink when they were feeling more depressed than usual (B = 0.136, 95% CI 0.0880, 0.185). The positive relationship between within-person depressive symptoms and alcohol use grew stronger at higher levels of within-person perceived social support. Conclusions: HIV-infected men who inject drugs have increased alcohol use when they are experiencing higher depressive symptoms than usual, while those with higher average depressive symptoms over time report less alcohol use. Social support strengthens the positive relationship between within-person depressive symptoms and alcohol use.

While the AUDIT is widely used with at-risk populations, such as military veterans, major gaps exist in the research literature regarding the construct validity of the AUDIT in military samples. Objectives: This study assessed the factor structure and measurement invariance of the AUDIT in a large sample of Canadian military veterans (N = 1669; 94.94% male). Methods: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using a random subsample (n = 825) to assess the underlying factor structure of the AUDIT. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using the second subsample (n = 844), was used to cross-validate the factor structure revealed by EFA and compare it to other model variants. Finally, multigroup CFAs were conducted using the whole sample to further cross-validate the factor structure and examine measurement invariance in military veterans with and without clinical elevations in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Results: Factor analyses revealed that a modified two-factor model provided a statistically better fit to the data compared to all other model variants; yet, the results did not confirm measurement invariance across military veterans with and without clinically significant symptoms of PTSD. Conclusions/Importance: The findings are in line with increasing evidence suggesting that two subscale scores should be calculated for the AUDIT. Results further suggest that care should be taken in interpreting AUDIT scores when PTSD symptoms are present for military veterans.

Safety Study of Combination Treatment: Deep Brain Stimulation and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						123	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00123			APR 3 2020	2020	Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) often receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment, in which conductive leads are surgically implanted in the brain. While DBS treats tremor and rigidity, patients often continue to suffer from speech and swallowing impairments. There is preliminary evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the cortex may be beneficial for these symptoms. However, the potential electromagnetic interactions of the strong magnetic fields from TMS on the conductive leads is unknown, and the combination therapy has not been approved for use. In this article, we report an experimental study of the safety of combining DBS and TMS. We fabricated an anatomically accurate head and brain phantom with electrical conductivities matching cerebrospinal fluid and averaged conductivity of gray and white matter. Induced current on an implanted DBS probe in the brain phantom was measured. Our results show that TMS will induce current values in the range or higher than typical DBS stimulation current. Thus, the combination of TMS/DBS treatment might cause over-stimulation in the brain when stimulated directly over the DBS lead with 100% TMS current intensity.

Hearing Aids Do Not Alter Cortical Entrainment to Speech at Audible Levels in Mild-to-Moderately Hearing-Impaired Subjects								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						109	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00109			APR 3 2020	2020	Background Cortical entrainment to speech correlates with speech intelligibility and attention to a speech stream in noisy environments. However, there is a lack of data on whether cortical entrainment can help in evaluating hearing aid fittings for subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss. One particular problem that may arise is that hearing aids may alter the speech stimulus during (pre-)processing steps, which might alter cortical entrainment to the speech. Here, the effect of hearing aid processing on cortical entrainment to running speech in hearing impaired subjects was investigated. Methodology Seventeen native English-speaking subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated in the study. Hearing function and hearing aid fitting were evaluated using standard clinical procedures. Participants then listened to a 25-min audiobook under aided and unaided conditions at 70 dBA sound pressure level (SPL) in quiet conditions. EEG data were collected using a 32-channel system. Cortical entrainment to speech was evaluated using decoders reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG data. Null decoders, obtained from EEG and the time-reversed speech envelope, were used to assess the chance level reconstructions. Entrainment in the delta- (1-4 Hz) and theta- (4-8 Hz) band, as well as wideband (1-20 Hz) EEG data was investigated. Results Significant cortical responses could be detected for all but one subject in all three frequency bands under both aided and unaided conditions. However, no significant differences could be found between the two conditions in the number of responses detected, nor in the strength of cortical entrainment. The results show that the relatively small change in speech input provided by the hearing aid was not sufficient to elicit a detectable change in cortical entrainment. Conclusion For subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss, cortical entrainment to speech in quiet at an audible level is not affected by hearing aids. These results clear the pathway for exploring the potential to use cortical entrainment to running speech for evaluating hearing aid fitting at lower speech intensities (which could be inaudible when unaided), or using speech in noise conditions.

Motor Cortical Network Plasticity in Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumors								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						118	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00118			APR 3 2020	2020	Objective: The adult brain's potential for plastic reorganization is an important mechanism for the preservation and restoration of function in patients with primary glial neoplasm. Patients with recurrent brain tumors requiring multiple interventions over time present an opportunity to examine brain reorganization. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can be used for motor cortical network mapping which, when performed at regular intervals, offers insight into this process of reorganization. Utilizing MEG-based motor mapping, we sought to characterize the reorganization of motor cortical networks over time in a cohort of 78 patients with recurrent glioma. Methods: MEG-based motor cortical maps were obtained by measuring event-related desynchronization (ERD) in ss-band frequency during unilateral index finger flexion. Each patient presented at our Department at least on two occasions for tumor resection due to tumor recurrence, and MEG-based motor mapping was performed as part of preoperative assessment before each surgical resection. Whole-brain activation patterns from first to second MEG scan (obtained before first and second surgery) were compared. Additionally, we calculated distances of activation peaks, which represent the location of the primary motor cortex (MC), to determine the magnitude of movement in motor eloquent areas between the first and second MEG scan. We also explored which demographic, anatomic, and pathological factors influence these shifts. Results: The whole-brain activation motor maps showed a subtle movement of the primary MC from first to second timepoint, as was confirmed by the determination of motor activation peaks. The shift of ipsilesional MC was directly correlated with a frontal-parietal tumor location (p < 0.001), presence of motor deficits (p = 0.021), and with a longer period between MEG scans (p = 0.048). Also, a disengagement of wide areas in the contralesional (ipsilateral to finger movement) hemisphere at the second time point was observed. Conclusions: MEG imaging is a sensitive method for depicting the plasticity of the motor cortical network. Although the location of the primary MC undergoes only subtle changes, appreciable shifts can occur in the setting of a stronger and longer impairment of the tumor on the MC. The ipsilateral hemisphere may serve as a reservoir for functional recovery.

The ASD population shows hyper-hypo sensitiveness to sensory stimuli that can generate alteration in information processing, affecting cognitive and social responses to daily life situations. Structured and semi-structured interviews are generally used for ASD assessment, and the evaluation relies on the examiner's subjectivity and expertise, which can lead to misleading outcomes. Recently, there has been a growing need for more objective, reliable, and valid diagnostic measures, such as biomarkers, to distinguish typical from atypical functioning and to reliably track the progression of the illness, helping to diagnose ASD. Implicit measures and ecological valid settings have been showing high accuracy on predicting outcomes and correctly classifying populations in categories. Methods Two experiments investigated whether sensory processing can discriminate between ASD and typical development (TD) populations using electrodermal activity (EDA) in two multimodal virtual environments (VE): forest VE and city VE. In the first experiment, 24 children with ASD diagnosis and 30 TDs participated in both virtual experiences, and changes in EDA have been recorded before and during the presentation of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli. In the second experiment, 40 children have been added to test the model of experiment 1. Results The first exploratory results on EDA comparison models showed that the integration of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli in the forest environment provided higher accuracy (90.3%) on sensory dysfunction discrimination than specific stimuli. In the second experiment, 92 subjects experienced the forest VE, and results on 72 subjects showed that stimuli integration achieved an accuracy of 83.33%. The final confirmatory test set (n = 20) achieved 85% accuracy, simulating a real application of the models. Further relevant result concerns the visual stimuli condition in the first experiment, which achieved 84.6% of accuracy in recognizing ASD sensory dysfunction. Conclusion According to our studies' results, implicit measures, such as EDA, and ecological valid settings can represent valid quantitative methods, along with traditional assessment measures, to classify ASD population, enhancing knowledge on the development of relevant specific treatments.

J	Angioletti, Laura; Balconi, Michela								Interoceptive empathy and emotion regulation: the contribution of neuroscience								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TRENDS					27			85	100		10.7358/neur-2020-027-ang2			APR 2020	2020	Sensory and cognitive processes connected to emotions are perceived as changes in body conditions and are encoded as affective feelings, also thanks to the contribution of interoception pathways. Interoception refers to the perception of internal body signals and has been previously related to emotion regulation processes and empathic response, even in the clinical neuroscience domain concerning emotional and social disorders. It is worth to note that interoception shares brain circuits, such as the anterior insula and portions of the prefrontal cortex, and physiological correlates involved in the empathic behavior, especially in response to pain perception. Thus, given the highly connoted emotional and sensory characteristics of the pain experience, empathy for pain studies represent an interesting ground for deepening the effects of an intentional interoceptive focus on the brain-and-body physiological response. In this context, a multi-method neuroscientific research protocol was recently developed, and its potential will be here discussed in the light of future application fields.

To testify this claim dual-task paradigm has been recreated for independent manipulation of top-down attention and awareness. While the subject are engaged in an attentional demanding central letter task, for awareness periphery task consisting gist of the natural scene, animal image and gender were presented for discrimination for less than 100ms. The subject performed in both single-task and dual-task conditions. After an adequate amount of training, stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was determined for all subjects individually. After final testing we can conclude that attention and consciousness are distinct phenomena. Subject could discriminate natural scene and animal images both in coloured and greyscale with performance as high as 90% correct judgement, while in gender discrimination the performance was moderately low around 70-80%.

The present study aimed at investigating the empowerment effect of a protocol based on centesimal prismatic lenses (SiXDEVICE (TM)) on attention orientation processes and their electrophysiological markers (event-related potentials, ERPs) by using a spatial cueing paradigm. Twenty participants were divided into an experimental group, training with SiXDEVICE (TM), and an active control group, performing traditional visual training. The comparison of pre/post-training performance measures and ERP markers of attention orienting - namely, the P300 component - highlighted qualitatively different patterns of performance modulation between the groups and a significant reduction of P300 amplitude over parietal areas in response to invalid cue trials in experimental participants. Preliminary results hint at the potential of the tested optical device and protocol as supportive tools to foster attention skills even in healthy people.

The relationships between verbal and non-verbal cognitive disorders of aphasic patients and the underlying mechanisms will be considered in the first part of this review. Then the contribution of gesture or drawing based tasks to the rehabilitation of aphasic patients will be discussed, taking separately into account: (a) the use of these tasks to compensate for a severe reduction of language abilities and (b) their use to improve naming ability in individuals with aphasia. The theoretical and clinical differences between the use of gesture or drawing-based tasks for rehabilitation purposes will subsequently be taken into account and, finally, the relationships between right hemisphere and non-verbal representational activities will be shortly discussed.

Nurse-guided Internet-delivered CBT-I might be a solution to improve access to care. Objective: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of nurse-guided Internet-delivered CBT-I (I-CBT-I) on insomnia severity experienced by patients in general practice. Methods: Nurse-guided I-CBT-I ("i-Sleep") was compared to care-as-usual (and I-CBT-I after 6 months) in 15 participating general practices among 134 patients (>= 18 years old) with clinical insomnia symptoms. Assessments took place at 8, 26 and 52 weeks. Primary outcome was self-reported insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were sleep diary indices, depression and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), fatigue, daytime consequences of insomnia, sleep medication and adverse events. Results: Two thirds of the 69 intervention patients (n = 47; 68%) completed the whole intervention. At the posttest examination, there were large significant effects for insomnia severity (Cohen's d =1.66), several sleep diary variables (wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, terminal wakefulness, sleep efficiency, sleep quality) and depression. At 26 weeks there were still significant effects on insomnia severity (d = 1.02) and on total sleep time and sleep efficiency. No significant effects were observed for anxiety, fatigue, daily functioning or sleep medication. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Nurse-guided I-CBT-I effectively reduces insomnia severity among general practice patients. I-CBT-I enables general practitioners to offer effective insomnia care in accordance with the clinical guidelines.

To address this challenge, we developed the manualized group intervention "healthy exercise behavior" (HEB). This study evaluates the efficacy of HEB for the reduction of compulsive exercise as add-on to routine inpatient treatment (treatment as usual [TAU]) in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Two hundred and seven adolescent and adult female inpatients with (atypical) AN were randomly allocated to TAU or to additional participation in HEB (TAU + HEB). HEB integrates elements of exercise-based therapy into a cognitive-behavioral approach. Assessments took place at admission, pre-intervention, post-intervention, discharge, and 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome was the severity of compulsive exercise assessed by the Commitment to Exercise Scale between pre- and post-intervention; secondary outcomes were additional aspects of compulsive exercise, assessed by the Compulsive Exercise Test, weight gain, eating disorder and general psychopathology, and emotion regulation. Results: In intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome, the TAU + HEB group showed significantly stronger reductions in the severity of compulsive exercise compared to the TAU group (z = -2.81; p = 0.005; effect size [ES] = -0.3). We also found significantly stronger reductions from admission to discharge (z= 2.62; p = 0.009; ES = -0.43), and from admission to follow-up (z = 2.1; p = 0.035; ES = -0.39). Regarding secondary outcomes, we found significant group differences between pre- and post-intervention in additional aspects of compulsive exercise (z = -2.55; p = 0.011; ES = -0.27). We did not find significant differences regarding weight gain, eating disorder and general psychopathology, and emotion regulation. Conclusions: Our intervention proved efficacious in reducing compulsive exercise in inpatients with (atypical) AN.

In which way this immune effect contributes to the impact of ECT on the central nervous system in depression remains unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether the hippocampal volumetric increase in depressed patients treated with ECT is related to changes in peripheral IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels. Methods: IL-6 and TNF-alpha plasma levels were measured in 62 patients 1 week before and after an acute course of ECT. Hippocampal volumes were analyzed in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) subsample of 13 patients at the same time points. Results: A significant decrease in IL-6 levels was observed in the total sample and a significant increase in hippocampal volume in the MRI subsample. The reduction of peripheral IL-6 correlated with an increase in total hippocampal volume. A more limited decrease of TNF-alpha correlated with a more limited increase of both the total and left hippocampus volumes. Conclusion: This pilot study is the first to highlight the link between peripheral immune changes and hippocampal volume increase following ECT. Further research is required to conclude whether ECT indeed exerts its central effect on the brain via changes of peripheral inflammatory markers. (c) 2020 S.

Such contextual influences lead to perceptually salient phenomena, such as the tilt aftereffect and the tilt illusion. Despite much research on the influence of an isolated context, it is not clear how multiple, possibly competing sources of contextual influence interact. Here, using psychophysical methods, we compared the combined influence of multiple contexts to the sum of the isolated context influences. The results showed large deviations from linear additivity for adjacent or overlapping contexts, and remarkably, clear additivity when the contexts were sufficiently separated. Specifically, for adjacent or overlapping contexts, the combined effect was often lower than the sum of the isolated component effects (sub-additivity), or was more influenced by one component than another (selection). For contexts that were separated in time (600 ma), the combined effect measured the exact sum of the isolated component effects (in degrees of bias). Overall, the results imply an initial compressive transformation during visual processing, followed by selection between the processed parts.

In this article, I provide an overview of some recent research to propose that humans are evolved to cooperate with others, and they now use social media to perform large-group cooperation. People use social media to satisfy various needs. One possible gratification is that social media is a technological advance that facilitates resources and information sharing, connection, and interaction among people all over the world to perform successful cooperation. The aim of the present study is to propose an integrated evolutionary explanation of social media use for cooperation. Social media help individuals to gain monetary and emotional resources via online social capital construction and consolidation, enhance reputation via sharing knowledge and information on social media, and maintain in-group interests via collective decision-making. Theoretical implications are discussed.

Moreover, eye design represents a balance between often conflicting requirements for gathering different forms of visual information. The trade-off between spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity is common to all visual systems, and European honeybees (Apis mellifera) present an important opportunity to better understand this trade-off. Vision has been studied extensively in A. mellifera as it is vital for foraging, navigation and communication. Consequently, spatial resolving power and contrast sensitivity in A. mellifera have been measured using several methodologies; however, there is considerable variation in estimates between methodologies. We assess pattern electroretinography (pERG) as a new method for assessing the trade-off between visual spatial and contrast information in A. mellifera. pERG has the benefit of measuring spatial contrast sensitivity from higher order visual processing neurons in the eye. Spatial resolving power of A. mellifera estimated from pERG was 0.54 cycles per degree (cpd), and contrast sensitivity was 16.9. pERG estimates of contrast sensitivity were comparable to previous behavioural studies. Estimates of spatial resolving power reflected anatomical estimates in the frontal region of the eye, which corresponds to the region stimulated by pERG. Apis mellifera has similar spatial contrast sensitivity to other hymenopteran insects with similar facet diameter (Myrmecia ant species). Our results support the idea that eye anatomy has a substantial effect on spatial contrast sensitivity in compound eyes.

Body mass index (BMI) data were collected for 3,752 Marvel comic characters. Males were on average "obese" whereas females averaged at the low end of normal weight. The male higher body mass was caused by extreme upper body muscularity. with male shoulder-to-waist ratios far above human limits. This is in stark contrast to low weight female superhero bodies with far lower waist-to-hip ratios than average humans.

The worse eye revisited: Evaluating the impact of asymmetric peripheral vision loss on everyday function								VISION RESEARCH				169				49	57		10.1016/j.visres.2019.10.012			APR 2020	2020	In instances of asymmetric peripheral vision loss (e.g., glaucoma), binocular performance on simple psychophysical tasks (e.g., static threshold perimetry) is well-predicted by the better seeing eye alone. This suggests that peripheral vision is largely 'better-eye limited'. In the present study, we examine whether this also holds true for real-world tasks, or whether even a degraded fellow eye contributes important information for tasks of daily living. Twelve normally-sighted adults performed an everyday visually-guided action (finding a mobile phone) in a virtual-reality domestic environment, while levels of peripheral vision loss were independently manipulated in each eye (gaze-contingent blur). The results showed that even when vision in the better eye was held constant, participants were significantly slower to locate the target, and made significantly more head- and eye-movements, as peripheral vision loss in the worse eye increased. A purely unilateral peripheral impairment increased response times by up to 25%, although the effect of bilateral vision loss was much greater ( > 200%). These findings indicate that even a degraded visual field still contributes important information for performing everyday visually-guided actions. This may have clinical implications for how patients with visual field loss are managed or prioritized, and for our understanding of how binocular information in the periphery is integrated.

Blood was collected for NSE and S100B. NAA, Cho, and Cr metabolite levels were measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) at 3T. Results: NSE and S100B levels were significantly higher in MDD subjects than in HC. The Cr level was significantly higher in MDD subjects than in HC, but the NAA and Cho levels did not differ between groups. NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios were significantly lower in patients with MDD versus HC. S100B was negatively correlated with the Cho levels. Conclusions: These results provide supporting evidence of neuronal and glial distress in MDD. Neuronal viability appears decreased, whereas glial regenerative activity and energy metabolism in the ACC increase in acute major depressive episode. Since low concentrations of S100B have neuroplastic effects, these changes may indicate a possible compensatory mechanism.

Changes in the expression of those factors are possibly responsible for morphologic abnormalities and symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Objective: The main goal of this research was to investigate the interrelationship between vitamin D, nerve growth factors (NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], and neuregulin-1 [NRG1]), and schizophrenia symptom domains. Methods: This research included 97 inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Blood samples were taken in order to analyze concentrations of vitamin D, BDNF, NRG1, and NGF growth factors. The obtained results were used in a multiple regression analysis. Results: The vitamin D concentration positively affected the concentration of NRG1 (F = 8.583, p = 0.005) but not the concentration of other investigated growth factors (BDNF and NGF). The clinical characteristics and symptom domains of schizophrenia seemed to be unaffected by the concentrations of vitamin D, BDNF, and NGF, while the NRG1 concentration significantly affected positive symptom domains of schizophrenia (F = 4.927, p = 0.030). Conclusion: The vitamin D concentration positively affected NRG1 levels but not schizophrenia symptomatology as measured by PANSS. The as-sociation between the two could be intermediated via NRG1.

Vergence is known to have a role in binocular vision. However recent studies link vergence eye movements also to attention and attention disorders. As attention may be involved in dyslexia, it is sensible to guess that the presence of reading difficulties can be associated with specific patterns in vergence responses. Data from school children performing a word-reading task have been analysed. In the task, children had to distinguish words from non-words (scrambled words or row of X's), while their eye positions were recorded. Our findings show that after stimulus presentation eyes briefly converge. These vergence responses depend on the stimulus type and age of the child, and are different for children with reading difficulties. Our findings support the idea of a role of attention in word reading and offer an explanation of altered attention in dyslexia.

VISION RESEARCH				169				1	5		10.1016/j.visres.2020.01.007			APR 2020	2020	#TheDress is perceived by some people as black and blue while others perceive it as white and gold. We have previously shown that the first encounter with #TheDress strongly biases its perception. This percept remained stable during the experiment, suggesting a role of one-shot learning. #TheShoe is another image that elicits similar bimodal color percepts. Here, we investigated how percepts change over time in both #TheShoe and #TheDress. First, we show that the important role of one-shot learning, which we found for #TheDress extends to #TheShoe. Similarly to our previous results with the dress, hiding large parts of the image with occluders biased the percept of the shoe. The percept did not change for the majority of observers when the occluders were removed. Second, we investigated if and how percepts switch over a time course of 14 days. We found that although some observers experienced percept switches, the percept was largely stable for most observers.

J	Burch, Rebecca L.; Gallup, Gordon G., Jr.								Abusive Men Are Driven by Paternal Uncertainty								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	2			197	209		10.1037/ebs0000163			APR 2020	2020	This study examined paternal assurance tactics and differential investment in children in a sample of 258 men in a court-mandated abuse treatment program. According to the paternal assurance model (Gallup & Burch. 2006), men would be expected to engage in a series of tactics to ensure their children are their own. First, men who suspect partner infidelity are predicted to engage in insemination prevention and counterinsemination strategies such as mate guarding and semen displacement. We found that sexual jealousy was cited more often than any other factor in the instigation and escalation of conflict. Sexual jealousy also triggered increases in mate guarding and sexual violence but not physical violence. When males were jealous, mate guarding behaviors nearly doubled, pressuring the partner to have sex "in a way she didn't want" tripled, and forcing the partner to have sex more than quadrupled. According to the model, if men do not believe initial tactics are successful. they may escalate to pregnancy termination strategies. In this sample. violence toward the female partner shifted from sexual coercion to physical violence when the man knew she was pregnant. Finally, the model predicts that men use postpartum investment strategies to invest primarily in children likely to cagy their genes, and if fear of cuckoldry remains, children may endure abuse or neglect. The presence of potentially unrelated children not only correlated with increased aggression against the partner but also physical punishment of those children. Levels of sexual jealousy and physical punishment of children were also correlated.

J	Grontvedt, Trond Viggo; Kennair, Leif Edward Ottesen; Bendixen, Mons								How Intercourse Frequency Is Affected by Relationship Length, Relationship Quality, and Sexual Strategies Using Couple Data								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	2			147	159		10.1037/ebs0000173			APR 2020	2020	The frequency of sexual intercourse within couples is associated with a variety of factors, such as relationship length, sexual and relationship satisfaction, and perceived quality of the relationship. Love, as a commitment device, might reduce interest in extrapair sex. Therefore, one can expect a negative association between measures of passion and sociosexual desire. Further, we wish to explore the effects of decoupling love and sex as measured by sociosexual attitudes on sexual frequency; as there might be a greater willingness to compromise on frequency of sex if sex is less related to expression of emotions and relational quality. We examined how men and women's sociosexuality, relationship length and various dimensions of relationship quality impact couples' intercourse frequency. Structural Equation Modeling analyses were performed on data from 92 romantically involved, heterosexual couples recruited at a Norwegian university. Participants' age ranged from 19 to 30 years. The current relationship length ranged from 1 month to 9 years (M = 21 months). Intercourse frequency decreased with increased length of relationship. Both men and women's ratings of relationship passion were strongly associated with frequency of having sex, but negatively associated with desire for extrapair sex. Intercourse was more frequent in couples where women reported less restricted attitudes, while men's level of sociosexuality had no effect on intercourse frequency in any of the models. These novel findings suggest that while men in general might desire sex more, in this sample from a highly egalitarian nation, men might be compromising more than women do.

Lines of evidence have indicated that the hippocampus and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors are related to the regulation of depression. Objective:The purpose of the present study was to observe the effect of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) on PD-related depression in rats. Methods: Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioning of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) was used to establish the hemiparkinsonian rat model. The effects of intra-dHIP injection of the 5-HT1A receptor -agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) or antagonist WAY-100635 on depressive-like behaviors were observed in sucrose preference and forced swim tests in control and lesioned rats. Monoamine levels including dopamine (DA), 5-HT, and noradrenaline (NA) in depression-related brain regions were determined by a neurochemical method in all groups. Results: Behavioral results showed that MFB lesions induced depressive-like behaviors. Intra-dHIP injection of 8-OH-DPAT produced antidepressant effects, while WAY-100635 induced or increased the depressive-like behaviors in both control and the lesioned rats. Neurochemical results found that intra-dHIP injection of 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased DA and 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral habenula (LHb), ventral hippocampus and amygdala in the lesioned group and decreased NA levels in the mPFC and LHb in the control group. Moreover, after injection of WAY-100635, NA levels in all these regions of the lesioned group were significantly increased. Conclusions: These findings suggest that hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors regulate depression and PD-related depression by neurochemical mechanisms.

J	Samaey, Celine; Wagemans, Johan; Moors, Pieter								Individual differences in processing orientation and proximity as emergent features								VISION RESEARCH				169				12	24		10.1016/j.visres.2020.02.002			APR 2020	2020	Numerous examples of meaningful inter-individual differences in visual processing have been documented in low- and high-level vision. For mid-level vision or perceptual organization, vision scientists have only recently started to study the inter-individual differences structure. In this study, we focus on orientation and proximity as emergent features and combine a quantitative information processing approach with an individual differences approach. We first replicated the results reported in Hawkins, Houpt, Eidels, and Townsend (2016) in a set of 52 observers. That is, observers showed higher processing capacity for detecting a change in a stimulus configuration when the emergent features orientation or proximity were changed. Next, we asked whether individual differences processing capacities were similar across emergent features. The capacity to detect any type of change correlated moderately across individuals, whereas the capacity to detect changes in either emergent feature alone was not strongly correlated. This indicates that there is no general sensitivity to emergent features and that observers can be good at detecting orientation changes whilst being poor at detecting proximity changes (and vice versa). An additional exploratory multivariate analysis of the data revealed that response times and accuracies correlated strongly within each emergent feature. Moreover, specific factors related to change detection and inward displacements were observed, revealing consistent individual differences in our data. We discuss the results in the context of the literature on individual differences in vision where both specific, fragmented factors as well as broad, general factors have been reported.

J	Anderson, Ryan C.; Surbey, Michele K.								Human Mate Copying as a Form of Nonindependent Mate Selection: Findings and Considerations								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	2			173	196		10.1037/ebs0000151			APR 2020	2020	Mate copying, or mate-choice copying, refers to the heightened probability of choosing or preferring a prospective mate as a result of them having been previously chosen by another individual. First demonstrated in nonhuman species. increasing evidence suggests the phenomenon also occurs in humans. Mate copying may be considered a form of nonindependent mate choice, whereby individuals incorporate additional information supplied by conspecifics into the selective process. Such additional information would be especially advantageous to individuals (typically females) who face higher informational constraints in selecting mates, and who are subject to greater fitness costs in the process of selection or as a result of poor mate choice decisions. In nonhumans, mate copying occurs largely as a result of visual association, following a potential mate being observed in courtship with another opposite sex conspecific. In human beings, who use many informational modalities, including visual, verbal, social, and deductive reasoning, mate copying may be based on a wider variety of cues and factors. This article reviews the evidence for human mate copying. beginning with that predating, yet foreshadowing, recognition of the phenomenon. As the evidence is somewhat equivocal and inconsistent, an attempt to comprehend how methodological or other factors may increase, attenuate, or modulate the probability of human mate copying or its detection is undertaken. In particular, the additional roles of nonvisual or inferred information, such as a potential mate's current availability, willingness to commit, their friendships with opposite sex peers, a former partner's characteristics, the valence of information provided about a potential mate, expected duration of a relationship, and a rater's level of experience in mate selection are considered.

We present 2 studies on (hypothetical) compensatory mating tactics. In Study 1 (N = 299), participants were asked to imagine they were struggling to find long-term and short-term mates and we revealed sex differences and context-specific effects consistent with parental investment theory. In Study 2 (N = 282), participants were asked to imagine they had been incapable of finding a short-term and long-term mate for 6 months despite actively trying to find one and then report the likelihood of abstaining, lowering their standards, and traveling farther to find a satisfactory partner; results largely (and conceptually) replicated those from Study 1 but document the role of attachment and (self-reported) mate value in accounting for individual differences in adopting the 3 mating tactics. We frame our results in terms of how people might solve mate shortages.

Neuroimaging studies found evidence for morphological and functional brain alterations in alexithymic subjects. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying alexithymia remain incompletely understood. Methods: We study the association of alexithymia with cortical correlation networks in a large community-dwelling sample of the Study of Health in Pomerania. Our analysis includes data of n = 2,199 individuals (49.4% females, age = 52.1 +/- 13.6 years) which were divided into a low and high alexithymic group by a median split of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Cortical correlation networks were constructed based on the mean thicknesses of 68 regions, and differences in centralities were investigated. Results: We found a significantly increased centrality of the right paracentral lobule in the high alexithymia network after correction for multiple testing. Several other regions with motoric and sensory functions showed altered centrality on a nominally significant level. Conclusions: Finding increased centrality of the paracentral lobule, a brain area with sensory as well as motoric features and involvement in bowel and bladder voiding, may contribute to explain the association of alexithymia with functional somatic disorders and chronic pain syndromes.

Advantage of detecting visual events in the right hemifield is affected by reading skill								VISION RESEARCH				169				41	48		10.1016/j.visres.2020.03.001			APR 2020	2020	Visual perception is often not homogenous across the visual field and can vary depending on situational demands. The reasons behind this inhomogeneity are not clear. Here we show that directing attention that is consistent with a western reading habit from left to right, results in a similar to 32% higher sensitivity to detect transient visual events in the right hemifield. This right visual field advantage was largely reduced in individuals with reading difficulties from developmental dyslexia. Similarly, visual detection became more symmetric in skilled readers, when attention was guided opposite to the reading pattern. Taken together, these findings highlight a higher sensitivity in the right visual field for detecting the onset of sudden visual events that is well accounted for by left hemisphere dominated reading habit.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) in office workers with treatment-resistant depression. Methods: In this study, we randomized office workers taking administrative leave for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode. dTMS treatment was applied at 120% resting motor threshold with 18 Hz over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The treatment sessions delivered a total of 1,980 pulses a day, 5 days a week, for 4-6 weeks. The primary outcome was change in the total score on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-21) from baseline to the end of study in an intent-to-treat analysis. The secondary outcomes were the response and remission rates. We also assessed changes in cognitive function and adverse events. Results: Forty patients were randomized to active or sham dTMS groups (1:1). The change in the total score on the HDRS-21 was more significantly improved in the active group than in the sham group at 6 weeks (p = 0.045). There were no significant differences in the response and remission rates or cognitive measures between the active and sham groups. No serious adverse events were observed in either group. Conclusions: These results suggest that dTMS might be effective and safe in office workers with treatment-resistant depression. Further well-designed studies are needed.

Small eyes in dim light: Implications to spatio-temporal visual abilities in Drosophila melanogaster								VISION RESEARCH				169				33	40		10.1016/j.visres.2020.02.007			APR 2020	2020	( )Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, are active over a range of light intensities in the wild, but lab-reared flies are often tested only in bright light. Similarly, scarce feeding during larval stages-common in nature-generates smaller adults, and a wide range of eye sizes not found in well-fed lab colonies. Both dimmer light and smaller eyes limit light capture and have undetermined effects on visual behaviors such as flight. In this study, we used moving sinusoidal gratings to test spatial acuity, temporal acuity, and contrast threshold of female flies of varying eye sizes at different light intensities. We also investigated vision in the smaller and often neglected male fruit flies. As light intensity drops from 50.1 lx to 0.3 lx, flies have a reduced spatial acuity (females: from 0.1 to 0.06 cycles per degree, CPD, males: 0.1 to 0.04 CPD) and temporal acuity (females: from 50 Hz to 10 Hz, males: 25 Hz to 10 Hz), and an increased contrast detection threshold (females: from 10% to 29%, males: 19% to 48%). We find no major sex-specific differences after accounting for eye size. Visual abilities in both small (eye area of 0.1-0.17 mm(2)) and large flies (0.17-0.23 mm(2)) suffer at 0.3 lx compared to 50.1 lx, but small flies suffer more (spatial acuity: 0.03 vs 0.06 CPD, contrast threshold: 76% vs 57%, temporal acuity: 5 Hz vs 10 Hz). Our results suggest visual abilities of small flies suffer more than large flies at low light levels, possibly leading to size- and light intensity-dependent effects on foraging, navigation, and flight.

Objective: Our aim is to evaluate whether those markers are altered in cannabis dependence. Methods: Forty-five cannabis-dependent patients diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria and 45 healthy controls matched according to sex, age, BMI, and smoking status were enrolled. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ceruloplasmin, lipid hydroperoxide, and total free thiols were measured in both groups. Those who had psychiatric comorbidities were excluded before sampling. Results: We found significantly increased BDNF, ceruloplasmin, and lipid hydroperoxide, and decreased free thiol levels in patients with cannabis dependence. There is also a positive correlation between BDNF and lipid hydroperoxide (n = r = 0.472, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation between BDNF and total thiols (n = r = -0.412, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Increased BDNF might be a sign of impaired neuronal plasticity that is crucial for memory formation and adaptive response to drug addiction. Neuronal plasticity in the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons was implied to play a role in substance addiction disorders, and these adaptations can be secondary to oxidative stress. Our findings, including increased lipid hydroperoxide, ceruloplasmin, and decreased free thiols, might support this hypothesis. In conclusion, cannabis dependency alters BDNF levels and increases oxidative stress.

We studied the effects of its injection in an anxiety test. Methods: The elevated plus maze test was used. Male rats bilaterally cannulated into the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) were employed. Rats were divided into 5 groups that received either 1 mu L injections of saline or cycloleucine (0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mu g) 15 min before testing. Results: Time spent in the open arm was significantly increased by cycloleucine treatment with all doses (1 and 2 mu g, p < 0.05; 0.5 and 4 mu g, p < 0.01), like number of extreme arrivals (0.5 and 1 mu g, p < 0.05; 2 mu g, p < 0.01; and 4 mu g, p < 0.001). Open arm entries were increased by the highest dose only (4 mu g, p < 0.01). Discussion/Conclusion: Present results show no difference between all doses in the time spent in the open arm, suggesting an indirect, noncompetitive action of the drug. The increase in extreme arrivals and open arm entries suggests a dose influence in these parameters. We conclude that cycloleucine influence on the NMDA receptors within NAS leads to anxiolytic-like effects and behavioral disinhibition, which once more confirms the involvement of NAS in anxiety processing.

Some previous studies using behavioral or subjective assessments have shown that short-term music training can benefit CI users' perception of music and speech. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings may reveal the neural basis for music training benefits in CI users. Objective To examine the effects of short-term music training on CI hearing outcomes using a comprehensive test battery of subjective evaluation, behavioral tests, and EEG measures. Design Twelve adult CI users were recruited for a home-based music training program that focused on attentive listening to music genres and materials that have an emphasis on melody. The participants used a music streaming program (i.e., Pandora) downloaded onto personal electronic devices for training. The participants attentively listened to music through a direct audio cable or through Bluetooth streaming. The training schedule was 40 min/session/day, 5 days/week, for either 4 or 8 weeks. The pre-training and post-training tests included: hearing thresholds, Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ12) questionnaire, psychoacoustic tests of frequency change detection threshold (FCDT), speech recognition tests (CNC words, AzBio sentences, and QuickSIN), and EEG responses to tones that contained different magnitudes of frequency changes. Results All participants except one finished the 4- or 8-week training, resulting in a dropout rate of 8.33%. Eleven participants performed all tests except for two who did not participate in EEG tests. Results showed a significant improvement in the FCDTs as well as performance on CNC and QuickSIN after training (p < 0.05), but no significant improvement in SSQ scores (p > 0.05). Results of the EEG tests showed larger post-training cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in seven of the nine participants, suggesting a better cortical processing of both stimulus onset and within-stimulus frequency changes. Conclusion These preliminary data suggest that extensive, focused music listening can improve frequency perception and speech perception in CI users. Further studies that include a larger sample size and control groups are warranted to determine the efficacy of short-term music training in CI users.

In individuals with Down syndrome (DS), this skill has begun to be examined using virtual exploration. Previous studies showed that individuals with DS can learn and remember paths in terms of sequences of turns and straight stretches, albeit with some difficulty, and this learning is supported by their cognitive abilities. This study further investigates environment learning in the DS population, newly examining their ability to learn a path from actual movements, and to learn increasingly long paths, and how their performance relates to their visuo-spatial abilities and everyday spatial activities. A group of 30 individuals with DS and 30 typically-developing (TD) children matched for receptive vocabulary performed a 4 x 4 Floor Matrix task in a grid comprising 16 squares (total area 2.3 x 2.3 meters). The task involved repeating increasingly long sequences of steps by actually moving in the grid. The sequences were presented in two learning conditions, called Observation (when participants watched the experimenter's moves), or Map (when they were shown a map reproducing the path). Several visuo-spatial measures were also administered. The results showed a clear difference between the two groups' performance in the individual visuo-spatial measures. In the Floor Matrix task, after controlling for visuo-spatial reasoning ability, both groups benefited to the same degree from the Observation condition vis-a-vis the Map condition, and no group differences emerged. In the group with DS, visuo-spatial abilities were more predictive of performance in the Floor Matrix task in the Observation condition than in the Map condition. The same was true of the TD group, but this difference was much less clear-cut. The visuo-spatial working memory and visualization tasks were the strongest predictors of Floor Matrix task performance. Finally, the group with DS showed a significant relation between Floor Matrix task performance in the Observation condition and everyday spatial activity. These results enlarge on what we know about path learning in individuals with DS and its relation to their visuo-spatial abilities. These findings are discussed within the frame of spatial cognition and the atypical development domain.

Preliminary findings from patients and healthy individuals suggest that travel planning (TP)-namely, navigational planning-can be considered a distinct process from visuospatial planning (VP) ability. To shed light on this distinction, two right brain-damaged patients without hemineglect were compared with a control group on two tasks aimed at testing VP (i.e., Tower of London-16, ToL-16) and TP (i.e., Minefield Task, MFT). The former requires planning the moves to reach the right configuration of three colored beads on three pegs, whereas the latter was opportunely developed to assess TP in the navigational environment when obstacles are present. Specifically, the MFT requires participants to plan a route on a large carpet avoiding some hidden obstacles previously observed. Patient 1 showed lesions encompassing the temporoparietal region and the insula; she performed poorer than the control group on the ToL-16 but showed no deficit on the MFT. Conversely, Patient 2 showed lesions mainly located in the occipitoparietal network of spatial navigation; she performed worse than the control group on the MFT but not on the ToL-16. In both cases performances satisfied the criteria for a classical dissociation, meeting criteria for a double dissociation. These results support the idea that TP is a distinct ability and that it is dissociated from VP skills.

This study presents an event-related potentials task (Brainy-ERP) that was developed in order to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of first-, second-, and third-order cognitive and affective ToM processing. The task was based on social visual cues and involved electroencephalographic event-related potential (ERP) analyses and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analyses (eLORETA) source localization analyses. Results showed that in cognitive and affective conditions, first-order trials elicited greater Anterior P2 (180-370 ms) amplitudes. In the cognitive condition, third-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in the broadly distributed early negative slow wave (eNSW, 260-470 ms) and the late NSW (LNSW, 460-1,000 ms). In the affective condition, third-order and second-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in a broadly distributed NSW (250-1,000 ms). Regarding affective trials in the NSW time span, statistical significant differences and trends were shown regarding activation of underlying brain regions. Third-order trials elicited greatest activation in a number of regions typically associated with the ToM network, especially the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Furthermore, ToM low performers (participants with high accuracy but longer reaction times) showed by trend smaller Posterior N1 and significantly smaller eNSW amplitudes compared to average and high performers. This study offers new insights into electrophysiological correlates of basic and higher order cognitive and affective ToM processing and its precise time course.

Egocentric and Allocentric Spatial Memory in Korsakoff's Amnesia								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						121	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00121			MAR 31 2020	2020	The goal of the present study was to investigate spatial memory in a group of patients with amnesia due to Korsakoff's syndrome (KS). We used a virtual spatial memory task that allowed us to separate the use of egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames to determine object locations. Research investigating the ability of patients with Korsakoff's amnesia to use different reference frames is scarce and it remains unclear whether these patients are impaired in using ego- and allocentric reference frames to the same extent. Twenty Korsakoff patients and 24 matched controls watched an animation of a bird flying in one of three trees standing in a virtual environment. After the bird disappeared, the camera turned around, by which the trees were briefly out of sight and then turned back to the center of the environment. Participants were asked in which tree the bird was hiding. In half of the trials, a landmark was shown. Half of the trials required an immediate response whereas in the other half a delay of 10 s was present. Patients performed significantly worse than controls. For all participants trials with a landmark were easier than without a landmark and trials without a delay were easier than with a delay. While controls were above chance on all trials patients were at chance in allocentric trials without a landmark present and with a memory delay. Patients showed no difference in the ego- and the allocentric condition. Together the findings suggest that despite the amnesia, spatial memory and especially the use of ego- and allocentric reference frames in Korsakoff patients are spared.

Facilitating a return to productive roles following acquired brain injury: The impact of pre-injury work level, current abilities, and neuropsychological performance								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				31	6			914	934		10.1080/09602011.2020.1746674			JUL 3 2021	2021	The primary aim of this study was to examine predictors of Return to Productive Roles (RTPR) in individuals with ABI following participation in a community-based RTPR intervention. One hundred and thirty participants were inducted to an ABI-specific RTPR programme. At induction, information on clinical and social demographics, previous education and employment roles were collected. Participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at baseline and completed assessments of disability, mental health and community integration. Participants were followed up at the end of their programme to assess RTPR. Three out of four participants who entered the RTPR programme returned to productive roles. Despite the relatively high levels of anxiety and depression in the sample, people who returned to productive roles were not significantly less anxious or depressed than those who did not. Logistic regression suggested that participants who returned to productive roles following the programme had higher levels of pre-ABI work engagement, less disability and performed better on neuropsychological assessment in terms of their language skills. Results suggest that these factors which cut across specific prior experience, cognitive performance, and social and disability areas of functioning represent barriers to an effective return to productive roles for people with ABI accessing RTPR intervention.

Whether and how these different top-down processes may lead to different modulations of the cortical response to nociceptive stimuli remains an open question. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to brief nociceptive laser stimuli in 24 healthy participants while they performed a task in which they had to compare two subsequent stimuli on their Spatial location (Location task) or Intensity (Intensity Task). In two additional blocks (Location + Ratings, and Intensity + Ratings) participants had to further provide a rating of the perceived intensity of the stimulus. Such a design allowed us to investigate whether focusing on spatial or intensity features of a nociceptive stimulus and rating its intensity would exert different effects on the EEG responses. We did not find statistical evidence for an effect on the signal while participants were focusing on different features of the signal. We only observed a significant cluster difference in frontoparietal leads at approximately 300-500 ms post-stimulus between the magnitude of the signal in the Intensity and Intensity + Rating conditions, with a less negative response in the Intensity + Rating condition in frontal electrodes, and a less positive amplitude in parietal leads. We speculatively propose that activity in those electrodes and time window reflects magnitude estimation processes. Moreover, the smaller frontal amplitude in the Intensity + Rating condition can be explained by greater working memory engagement known to reduce the magnitude of the EEG signal. We conclude that different top-down attentional processes modulate responses to nociceptive laser stimuli at different electrodes and time windows depending on the underlying processes that are engaged.

This experiment aimed to compare post-immersion craving in occasional and heavy alcohol drinkers. Twenty-two occasional drinkers and eighteen heavy drinkers were recruited and immersed in a virtual bar, including alcoholic beverages. After the exposure, heavy drinkers reported a significantly higher craving than occasional drinkers. Post-immersion alcohol craving was significantly related to the levels of perceived ecological validity of the virtual environment. Finally, a moderation analysis suggested that the levels of craving more strongly increased with perceived ecological validity in heavy drinkers than in occasional drinkers. Therefore, the perceived ecological validity was an important experimental parameter to study craving in a virtual environment. These results further suggested that virtual reality might be a useful tool for both the scientific study of alcohol addiction and the treatment of alcohol dependence and relapse.

We recently demonstrated a disruption of prosocial behavior following heroin self-administration in rats, as assessed by examining the animals' propensity to rescue its cagemate from a plastic restrainer while having simultaneous access to heroin. To examine the possibility that heroin-induced deficits in prosocial function are mediated by the AIC, the present study examined the effects of chemogenetic activation or inhibition of excitatory AIC pyramidal neurons on heroin-induced prosocial deficits. After establishment of baseline rescuing behavior, rats received bilateral infusions of viral vectors encoding either a control virus (AAV-CaMKII alpha-GFP), stimulatory DREADD (AAV-CaMKII alpha-hM3Dq-mCherry) (Experiment 1), or inhibitory DREADD (AAV-CaMKII alpha-hM4Di-mCherry) (Experiment 2), into the AIC. Rats were then allowed to self-administer heroin (0.06 mg/kg/infusion) 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. Prior to re-assessment of prosocial behavior, animals were administered clozapine-N-oxide (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) to assess the effects of chemogenetic activation or inhibition of the AIC. Relative to control animals, chemogenetic activation of the AIC reversed deficits in rescuing behavior induced by heroin, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of the AIC had no effect. We hypothesize that stimulatory neuromodulation of the AIC may be a novel approach for restoring prosociality in opiate abuse.

However, these markers have rarely been studied related to aging and depression within one study. Here, we investigated auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain that may show different alterations related to aging and depression. We used an oddball condition employing changes in sound intensity to investigate: (i) sound intensity dependence; (ii) sensory gating; and (iii) change detection, all within a single paradigm. The ERPs of younger (18-40 years) and older (62-80 years) depressed female participants and age-matched non-depressed participants were measured. Intensity dependence was examined as the difference between N1 responses to repeated high- and low-intensity sounds, sensory gating as N1 responses to rare and repeated sounds, and change detection as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN). We found that intensity dependence was greater in older participants than younger ones, indicating effects related to aging but not to depression. For sensory gating, we found depression- and age-related alterations as increased N1 responses. No group differences were found for MMN. Although a sensory gating deficit was expected in older adults, this study is the first to demonstrate age-related overexcitability in sound intensity dependency. The results indicate that automatic brain responses to sound intensity changes are suitable for studying age- and depression-related neural markers but may not be sensitive enough to differentiate the effects of aging and depression.

Associations Between Individual Differences in Mathematical Competencies and Surface Anatomy of the Adult Brain								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14							10.3389/fnhum.2020.00116			MAR 27 2020	2020	Previously conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the neuroanatomical correlates of mathematical abilities and competencies have several methodological limitations. Besides small sample sizes, the majority of these studies have employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM)-a method that, although it is easy to implement, has some major drawbacks. Taking this into account, the current study is the first to investigate in a large sample of typically developed adults the associations between mathematical abilities and variations in brain surface structure by using surface-based morphometry (SBM). SBM is a method that also allows the investigation of brain morphometry by avoiding the pitfalls of VBM. Eighty-nine young adults were tested with a large battery of psychometric tests to measure mathematical competencies in four different areas: (1) simple arithmetic; (2) complex arithmetic; (3) higher-order mathematics; and (4) numerical intelligence. Also, we asked participants for their mathematics grades for their final school exams. Inside the MRI scanner, we collected high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images from each subject. SBM analyses were performed with the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12) and indices for cortical thickness, for cortical surface complexity, for gyrification, and sulcal depth were calculated. Further analyses revealed associations between: (1) the cortical surface complexity of the right superior temporal gyrus and numerical intelligence; (2) the depth of the right central sulcus and adults' ability to solve complex arithmetic problems; and (3) the depth of the left parieto-occipital sulcus and adults' higher-order mathematics competence. Interestingly, no relationships with previously reported brain regions were observed, thus, suggesting the importance of similar research to confirm the role of the brain regions found in this study.

These advances serve as both "markers of progress" and challenges and opportunities for ongoing address, engagement, and deliberation as we move to improve the functional capabilities and translational value of DBS. It is in this light that these proceedings are presented to inform the field and initiate ongoing discourse. As consistent with the intent, and spirit of this, and prior DBS Think Tanks, the overarching goal is to continue to develop multidisciplinary collaborations to rapidly advance the field and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

J	Wei, Wei; Mo, Zan; Liu, Jianhua; Meng, Liang								Man's Pursuit of Meaning: Unexpected Termination Bolsters One's Autonomous Motivation in an Irrelevant Ensuing Activity								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						81	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00081			MAR 27 2020	2020	Meaningfulness has been suggested as one of the fundamental psychological needs, as one would actively pursue meaning in both his/her work life and personal life. Previous studies consistently showed that a lack of meaning in work would reduce one's autonomous motivation in the current job, which is the motivation to engage in self-determined activities driven by one's own interests or personal beliefs. However, researchers overlooked the fact that in work settings, it is not uncommon that people work on multiple tasks in a row. As a result, the cross-task effect of work meaningfulness remains understudied. Based on the meaning maintenance model (MMM) and the suggested fluid compensation strategy, we predicted that the disappearance of the meaning of work may induce a compensatory response and thus enhance one's autonomous motivation in an irrelevant ensuing activity. To test this hypothesis, we invited participants to work on an encyclopedic knowledge quiz in Session 1 and a StopWatch (SW) task in Session 2. A between-subject design was adopted. While participants in the control group successfully completed their tasks in Session 1, those in the experimental group encountered unexpected program quits by the end of the quiz, and their previous efforts suddenly became futile and meaningless. Electroencephalography was recorded during the experiment to measure reward positivity (RewP). In Session 2, a more pronounced RewP in the win-lose difference wave was observed in the experimental group in contrast to the control group, suggesting that the disappearance of the meaning of work enhanced one's autonomous motivation in an irrelevant activity that follows. Therefore, results of this study provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence for one's pursuit of meaning and the compensation effect induced by the disappearance of the meaning of work.

Method: A probability sample of 242 adults (range 25-75 years; M age = 47.57 years) from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Boston Study of Management Processes were measured on personality and cognition. Using Raven's Progressive Matrices Test as the dependent measure of reasoning, age and neuroticism were entered as independent variables into a hierarchical regression analysis with education and basic cognitive processes (processing speed and working memory) as control variables. Results: Age (younger) and neuroticism (lower) positively predicted reasoning performance. These main effects were further qualified by an age X neuroticism interaction. Younger adults low in neuroticism performed significantly better on reasoning than those high in neuroticism, whereas the relationship of neuroticism with reasoning was not significant for the middle-aged and older adults. Conclusions: Neuroticism affects reasoning performance in young adults but not older adults. Age-related improvements in emotional regulation are suggested as a mechanism for this relationship.

Establishing a Causal Role for Medial Prefrontal Cortex in Reality Monitoring; Establishing a Causal Role for Medial Prefrontal Cortex in Reality Monitoring								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE; FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						106	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00106			MAR 25 2020	2020	Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. Functional imaging studies have consistently found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring. This study aimed to determine a causal role for mPFC in reality monitoring using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS). In a subject-blinded sham-controlled crossover design, healthy individuals received either active or sham nrTMS targeting mPFC. Active modulation of mPFC using nrTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz, significantly improved identification of both self-generated and externally-derived information during reality monitoring, when compared to sham or baseline. Targeted excitatory modulation of mPFC also improved positive mood, reduced negative mood, and increased overall alertness/arousal. These results establish optimal nrTMS dosing parameters that maximized tolerability/comfort and induced significant neuromodulatory effects in the mPFC target. Importantly, this is a proof-of-concept study that establishes the mPFC as a novel brain target that can be stimulated with nrTMS to causally impact both higher-order reality monitoring and mood.

J	Barone, Pamela; Bedia, Manuel G.; Gomila, Antoni								A Minimal Turing Test: Reciprocal Sensorimotor Contingencies for Interaction Detection								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						102	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00102			MAR 24 2020	2020	In the classical Turing test, participants are challenged to tell whether they are interacting with another human being or with a machine. The way the interaction takes place is not direct, but a distant conversation through computer screen messages. Basic forms of interaction are face-to-face and embodied, context-dependent and based on the detection of reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies. Our idea is that interaction detection requires the integration of proprioceptive and interoceptive patterns with sensorimotor patterns, within quite short time lapses, so that they appear as mutually contingent, as reciprocal. In other words, the experience of interaction takes place when sensorimotor patterns are contingent upon one's own movements, and vice versa. I react to your movement, you react to mine. When I notice both components, I come to experience an interaction. Therefore, we designed a "minimal" Turing test to investigate how much information is required to detect these reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies. Using a new version of the perceptual crossing paradigm, we tested whether participants resorted to interaction detection to tell apart human from machine agents in repeated encounters with these agents. In two studies, we presented participants with movements of a human agent, either online or offline, and movements of a computerized oscillatory agent in three different blocks. In each block, either auditory or audiovisual feedback was provided along each trial. Analysis of participants' explicit responses and of the implicit information subsumed in the dynamics of their series will reveal evidence that participants use the reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies within short time windows. For a machine to pass this minimal Turing test, it should be able to generate this sort of reciprocal contingencies.

J	Jung, Stefanie; Moeller, Korbinian; Karnath, Hans-Otto; Klein, Elise								Hemispheric Lateralization of Arithmetic Facts and Magnitude Processing for Two-Digit Numbers								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						88	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00088			MAR 24 2020	2020	In the human brain, a (relative) functional asymmetry (i.e., laterality; functional and performance differences between the two cerebral hemispheres) exists for a variety of cognitive domains (e.g., language, visual-spatial processing, etc.). For numerical cognition, both bi-lateral and unilateral processing has been proposed with the retrieval of arithmetic facts postulated as being lateralized to the left hemisphere. In this study, we aimed at evaluating this claim by investigating whether processing of multiplicatively related triplets in a number bisection task (e.g., 12_16_20) in healthy participants (n= 23) shows a significant advantage when transmitted to the right hemisphere only as compared to transmission to the left hemisphere. As expected, a control task revealed that stimulus presentation to the left or both visual hemifields did not increase processing disadvantages of unit-decade incompatible number pairs in magnitude comparison. For the number bisection task, we replicated the multiplicativity effect. However, in contrast to the hypothesis deriving from the triple code model, we did not observe significant hemispheric processing asymmetries for multiplicative items. We suggest that participants resorted to keep number triplets in verbal working memory after perceiving them only very briefly for 150 ms. Rehearsal of the three numbers was probably slow and time-consuming so allowing for interhemispheric communication in the meantime. We suggest that an effect of lateralized presentation may only be expected for early effects when the task is sufficiently easy.

Effects of Visual Scene Complexity on Neural Signatures of Spatial Attention								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						91	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00091			MAR 24 2020	2020	Spatial selective attention greatly affects our processing of complex visual scenes, yet the way in which the brain selects relevant objects while suppressing irrelevant objects is still unclear. Evidence of these processes has been found using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). However, few studies have characterized these measures during attention to dynamic stimuli, and little is known regarding how these measures change with increased scene complexity. Here, we compared attentional modulation of the EEG N1 and alpha power (oscillations between 8-14 Hz) across three visual selective attention tasks. The tasks differed in the number of irrelevant stimuli presented, but all required sustained attention to the orientation trajectory of a lateralized stimulus. In scenes with few irrelevant stimuli, top-down control of spatial attention is associated with strong modulation of both the N1 and alpha power across parietal-occipital channels. In scenes with many irrelevant stimuli in both hemifields, however, top-down control is no longer represented by strong modulation of alpha power, and N1 amplitudes are overall weaker. These results suggest that as a scene becomes more complex, requiring suppression in both hemifields, the neural signatures of top-down control degrade, likely reflecting some limitation in EEG to represent this suppression.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						73	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00073			MAR 24 2020	2020	The acquisition and evolution of speech production, discourse and communication can be negatively impacted by brain malformations. We describe, for the first time, a case of developmental dynamic dysphasia (DDD) in a right-handed adolescent boy (subject D) with cortical malformations involving language-eloquent regions (inferior frontal gyrus) in both the left and the right hemispheres. Language evaluation revealed a markedly reduced verbal output affecting phonemic and semantic fluency, phrase and sentence generation and verbal communication in everyday life. Auditory comprehension, repetition, naming, reading and spelling were relatively preserved, but executive function was impaired. Multimodal neuroimaging showed a malformed cerebral cortex with atypical configuration and placement of white matter tracts bilaterally and abnormal callosal fibers. Dichotic listening showed right hemisphere dominance for language, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) additionally revealed dissociated hemispheric language representation with right frontal activation for phonology and bilateral dominance for semantic processing. Moreover, subject D also had congenital mirror movements (CMM), defined as involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements of the other side. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI during voluntary unimanual (left and right) hand movements showed bilateral motor cortex recruitment and tractography revealed a lack of decussation of bilateral corticospinal tracts. Genetic testing aimed to detect mutations that disrupt the development of commissural tracts correlating with CMM (e.g., Germline DCC mutations) was negative. Overall, our findings suggest that DDD in subject D resulted from the underdevelopment of the left inferior frontal gyrus with limited capacity for plastic reorganization by its homologous counterpart in the right hemisphere. Corpus callosum anomalies probably contributed to hinder interhemispheric connectivity necessary to compensate language and communication deficits after left frontal involvement.

However, the different network patterns under different emotional states in the high gamma band (50-80 Hz) remain unclear. In this paper, we investigate different emotional states using functional network analysis on various frequency bands. We constructed multiple functional networks on different frequency bands and performed functional network analysis and time-frequency analysis on these frequency bands to determine the significant features that represent different emotional states. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of these features by using them in emotion recognition. Our experimental results revealed that the network connections in the high gamma band with significant differences among the positive, neutral, and negative emotional states were much denser than the network connections in the other frequency bands. The connections mainly occurred in the left prefrontal, left temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Moreover, long-distance connections with significant differences among the emotional states were observed in the high frequency bands, particularly in the high gamma band. Additionally, high gamma band fusion features derived from the global efficiency, network connections, and differential entropies achieved the highest classification accuracies for both our dataset and the public dataset. These results are consistent with literature and provide further evidence that high gamma band EEG signals are more sensitive and effective than the EEG signals in other frequency bands in studying human affective perception.

Previous research has focussed primarily on factors negatively associated with outcome, with less focus on factors facilitating the recovery process. The current qualitative study examined positive factors identified for recovery by individuals who had sustained severe TBI three years earlier. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine participants with TBI and 16 close-others. Participants were asked to identify factors about themselves (or the injured individual), those around them, and the care they received that they felt were positive for recovery. Using reflexive thematic analysis, three themes were identified as positive for recovery after a TBI. Having a support network included social supports such as family and friends, and receiving other funded/non-funded assistance towards improving independence and participation. Being positive and engaged included being able to participate, being positive, using compensatory strategies, and becoming fit, healthy and happy. Getting good care included patients perceiving they had a comprehensive and good quality hospital experience, and access to multidisciplinary outpatient services. A focus on enhancing these positive environmental, personal and service factors in service provision may enhance outcomes following severe TBI.

Methods: Participants were recruited in the City Leisure Center for Elderly People and Social Care Home for Elderly People and randomly assigned to two groups: a study group and control group. The survey sample consisted of 40 respondents (aged 68 +/- 8 years), who met the inclusion criteria. Respondents exercised to the Adapted Physical Activity Program, which consisted of a study of motivation to exercise, testing of physical parameters and adaptation of functional training to respondents physical needs. Results: Before starting functional training, the balance of study group was 44% (p < .05) lower if compared to the control group. We determined statistically significant change of coordination after FT - 17.75% (p < .05). The data of semi-structured interview were coded and attributed to specific subcategories, four categories were established: self-expression, self-awareness, body image, and self-esteem. Conclusions: Certain living environments may limit the need and possibility for the elderly people to exercise while enjoying the sense of communion through physical activity.

Our purpose was to assess the utility of a 20-sec stepping test (ST) and Kinect (TM) infrared-depth sensor in providing objective evaluation of balance toward identifying disability in older adults. Methods: Men and women between 64 and 90 years of age, consisting of independent (IG; n = 37) and dependent (DG; n = 38) living at community, geriatric day-care center in Japan. Total movement distance (TMD) and greatest displacement (MMD) were calculated from Kinect (TM) recording of the ST. Results: DG had lower FIM scores than IG. TMD and MMD were significantly greater in DG than IG, while step number and rate were lower in DG. Receiver-operator characteristic analysis showed TMD, TMD/step, MMDstep, and MMD corrected for time and height strongly discriminated between assignment to DG or IG with moderate sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Greater TMD and MMD observed during a 20-sec ST appear to indicate disability with moderate sensitivity and specificity in older adults. Measures of movement distance (e.g. TMD, MMD) appear indicative of changes in dynamic balance due to a circuitous movement pattern generated by aberrant step replacement with repeated stepping-in-place.

To explore the effects of SP-NFT on trainability and neuroplasticity, we conducted a study in which 45 healthy participants were randomly divided into three groups: based on sensory-motor rhythm of C3, Cz and C4 (SMR group), based on alpha rhythm of T3 and T4 (Alpha group), and no NFT (control group). The training was performed for six sessions for 3 weeks. Before and after the SP-NFT, we evaluated changes in shooting performance and resting electroencephalography (EEG) frequency power, participant's subjective task appraisal, neurofeedback trainability score, and EEG feature. Statistical analysis showed that the shooting performance of the participants in the SMR group improved significantly, the participants in the Alpha group decreased, and that of participants in the control group have no change. Meanwhile, the resting EEG power features of the two NFT groups changed specifically after training. The training process data showed that the training difficulty was significantly lower in the SMR group than in the Alpha group. Both NFT groups could improve the neurofeedback trainability scores and change the feedback features by means of their mind strategy. These results may provide evidence of trainability and neuroplasticity for SP-NFT, suggesting that the SP-NFT is effective in brain regulation and thus provide a potential method to improve shooting performance.

Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is one type of EEG signals in response to an auditory stimulus, and it has been widely used to evaluate the potential disorders of the auditory function within the brain. Currently, the ABR measurements in the clinic usually adopt a fixed stimulation rate (FSR) technique in which the late evoked response could contaminate the ABR signals and deteriorate the waveform differentiation after averaging, thus compromising the overall auditory function assessment task. To resolve this issue, this study proposed a random stimulation rate (RSR) method by integrating a random interval between two adjacent stimuli. The results showed that the proposed RSR method was consistently repeatable and reliable in multiple trials of repeated measurements, and there was a large amplitude of successive late evoked response that would contaminate the ABR signals for conventional FSR methods. The ABR waveforms of the RSR method showed better wave I-V morphology across different stimulation rates and stimulus levels, and the improved ABR morphology played an important role in early diagnoses of auditory pathway abnormities. The correlation coefficients as functions of averaging time showed that the ABR waveform of the RSR method stabilizes significantly faster, and therefore, it could be used to speed up current ABR measurements with more reliable testing results. The study suggests that the proposed method would potentially aid the adequate reconstruction of ABR signals towards a more effective means of hearing loss screening, brain function diagnoses, and potential brain-computer interface.

Return to work seems almost impossible and has not been reported so far. Here, three cases with extensive right-hemisphere lesions after stroke are reported, who all showed residual left visuospatial neglect, left visual extinction on double simultaneous stimulation (DSS), and marked spatial-perceptual deficits. After early inpatient rehabilitation all three patients received specific, successive neuropsychological therapy as outpatients in four domains: (1) Optokinetic stimulation with pursuit eye movements and saccadic eye-movement training to reduce left-sided neglect and improve visual exploration; (2) Anti-extinction training to reduce left-sided visual extinction; (3) Spatial-perceptual feedback training to improve spatial-perceptual disorders and visuoconstruction; and (4) Job-related visual and cognitive treatments. All three cases were treated in sequential single-subject baseline designs. Significant improvements were obtained in all treated domains during therapy, which persisted at follow up. After a period of graded vocational re-integration, all three patients worked successfully in their prior job, two part-time (50%), one full-time (100%). These results show that return to professional (paid) work is possible despite initially severe neglect, hemianopia, visual extinction, and spatial-perceptual disorders after stroke.

J	Testolin, Alberto								The Challenge of Modeling the Acquisition of Mathematical Concepts								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						100	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00100			MAR 20 2020	2020	As a full-blown research topic, numerical cognition is investigated by a variety of disciplines including cognitive science, developmental and educational psychology, linguistics, anthropology and, more recently, biology and neuroscience. However, despite the great progress achieved by such a broad and diversified scientific inquiry, we are still lacking a comprehensive theory that could explain how numerical concepts are learned by the human brain. In this perspective, I argue that computer simulation should have a primary role in filling this gap because it allows identifying the finer-grained computational mechanisms underlying complex behavior and cognition. Modeling efforts will be most effective if carried out at cross-disciplinary intersections, as attested by the recent success in simulating human cognition using techniques developed in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this respect, deep learning models have provided valuable insights into our most basic quantification abilities, showing how numerosity perception could emerge in multi-layered neural networks that learn the statistical structure of their visual environment. Nevertheless, this modeling approach has not yet scaled to more sophisticated cognitive skills that are foundational to higher-level mathematical thinking, such as those involving the use of symbolic numbers and arithmetic principles. I will discuss promising directions to push deep learning into this uncharted territory. If successful, such endeavor would allow simulating the acquisition of numerical concepts in its full complexity, guiding empirical investigation on the richest soil and possibly offering far-reaching implications for educational practice.

Our study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cannabis use in pregnancy using urine drug screens obtained at the time of admission to Labor and Delivery. Methods: De-identified laboratory data from three birthing hospitals located in Maryland were used to determine the percentage of cannabis positive urine toxicology tests among women admitted to Labor and Delivery. Data were collected at each site starting the year that universal urine cannabis testing was instituted. One hospital also performed universal testing of newborns which was contrasted with maternal data there. Results: Overall, 5.7% of the 22,435 maternal and 3.4% of the 8,346 newborn urine toxicology tests and were positive for cannabis. Trends varied between institutions. When all three institutions were combined, the percent of positive urine toxicology tests was unchanged between 2016 and 2018. At Site 1 between 2014 and 2018, the percentage of cannabis positive urine toxicology tests increased from 5.7% to 9.9% and newborn tests increased from 1.7% to 3.4%. Only 27.7% of the neonates born to women with positive screens also had a positive screen at the time of birth. Conclusions: Prevalence of cannabis use until the time of delivery vary by location but were largely unchanged over a period of drug liberalization.

J	Czaderny, Krzysztof								Adolescent Personality Risk Factors for Tobacco Smoking and Alcohol Misuse in Adult Men								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1567	1574		10.1080/10826084.2020.1741635			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Social identity theory proposes that people define themselves in terms of the social groups they belong to or aspire to belong to. Tobacco smoking and alcohol use in men have been hypothesized to be symbolic of adult male status. The current study examines whether adolescent personality characteristics linked to masculinity and nonconformity are associated with tobacco smoking and alcohol misuse in men. Methods: The analysis is based on the results of a cross-sectional study conducted in 2018 on a stratified, random sample of 703 adult male residents of Warsaw, Poland, with elementary- and secondary-school education. All survey data were collected through a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. A path model is employed to examine the direct and indirect effects of adolescent characteristics on tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Results: According to the path model, retrospective perceptions of self-reported character strength, rebellion against unjustified prohibitions and rules, ease in making decisions, willingness to differ from others, and interest in the opposite gender in adolescence had a significant direct effect on tobacco smoking in adolescence and a significant indirect effect on tobacco smoking in adulthood. The variables representing character strength, rebellion against unjustified prohibitions and rules, ease in making decisions, and interest in the opposite gender in adolescence also showed a significant direct effect on alcohol use in adolescence. Conclusion: Masculinity and nonconformity were related to addictive behaviors in men, which might have health policy implications. In this paper, associating traditional masculinity with health orientation in society is proposed as a possible preventive intervention.

However, at this stage in the implementation process, it can be challenging to get a sense of the outcomes of this policy shift - hence why we turned to media. Purpose/objectives: We present the results of a qualitative content analysis conducted on the media coverage between October 2018 and April 2019. Methods: We used Google News and ProQuest database to complete our search. We included online media articles published between October 2018 and April 2019 in English. This left us with 81 eligible articles. These articles were analyzed by blending deductive and inductive approaches. Results: The articles were grouped into 5 categories: 1) housing, 2) access, 3) workplace, 4) driving, and 5) public consumption. Each category was then analyzed to identify emerging themes across news stories. Overall, we found that non-governmental actors such as landlords and employers were given a great deal of flexibility to introduce overly broad and restrictive regulations that disproportionately impact various communities. We also found that emphasis was placed on banning cannabis in various spheres of life as opposed to adapting to the new reality that cannabis is now legal. Conclusion: Real-time observations are critically needed to better understand the impact of policy implementation across the three levels of government: federal, provincial and territorial, and municipal. Our findings suggest that media coverage analysis can help us understand and track issues as they arise.

J	Tam, Cheuk Chi; Benotsch, Eric G.; Li, Xiaoming								Self-Esteem and Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs among College Students: Coping as a Mediator								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	8			1309	1319		10.1080/10826084.2020.1735441			MAY 1 2020	2020	Objectives: Non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) has become a threat to public health. In the United States, NMUPD is especially common in young adults (aged 18-25). Self-esteem is a robust psychosocial factor of substance use. The substance use literature also documents that self-esteem is associated with alcohol use through other cognitive factors, such as coping. Given the important role of coping in substance use intervention, it is important to understand how coping alters mechanisms underlying the effects of self-esteem on NMUPD. However, little research has explored mediational mechanisms among self-esteem, coping, and NMUPD. The current study sought to examine a hypothesized mediation model among self-esteem, coping, and NMUPD in college students. Methods: Data were collected online from 1052 undergraduates (aged 18 to 25; 723 females) in a large public university in Virginia. Participants reported their past-three-month NMUPD (i.e. opioids, sedatives, anxiolytics, and stimulants), self-esteem, and coping (13 domains; e.g. active coping and self-blame). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to identify the factorial structure of coping. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed for examining the hypothesized mediation model. Results: EFA and CFA identified a two-factor structure of coping (i.e. adaptive coping and maladaptive coping). SEM suggested that adaptive coping together with maladaptive coping completely mediated the relationship between self-esteem and NMUPD. The goodness-of-fit indicators suggest a good model fit (RMSEA = .04; CFI = .95; TLI = .93; WRMR = 1.11). Conclusion: Self-esteem appears to be a protective factor for NMUPD in college students, and its relationship with NMUPD is mediated by two types of coping. Future interventions targetting NMUPD among college students should attend to self-esteem and coping.

A 35-year-old male (BR) with impaired ability to recognize facial emotions as a result of severe TBI participated in the study over a 3-month duration. BR's mean accuracy across six universal static facial expressions of emotion improved significantly during intervention and was maintained at follow up. BR was most impaired in labelling negative (sad, angry, disgusted, anxious) versus positive facial expressions (surprised, happy). BR's accuracy to negative facial affect significantly improved during intervention. No further improvement was possible for positive expressions because a ceiling effect was observed at baseline. Overall BR's mean response times across emotions was reduced at baseline but increased significantly during intervention. This was also recorded for both positive and negative expressions, respectively. This novel combined intervention has potential to improve facial affect recognition after TBI. Further evaluation using a multiple-baseline design is recommended. Additional research is needed to determine whether improved facial affect recognition following training translates to improvements in social function and communication in people with TBI.

Research identifying modifiable characteristics associated with opioid dependence and associated negative outcomes may inform the development of targeted interventions for this high-risk population. One factor warranting investigation is low distress tolerance (DT). Purpose/Objectives: In a sample of patients in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, the present study examined DT levels among patients with current opioid dependence versus no history of opioid dependence, as well as the moderating role of gender. We predicted that patients with opioid dependence would exhibit lower DT than those without a history of opioid dependence, and that women with opioid dependence would exhibit lower levels of DT than men with opioid dependence. Methods: A sample of 203 patients in residential SUD treatment were administered a series of diagnostic interviews and a behavioral measure of DT. Results: DT did not differ significantly as a function of opioid dependence. However, there was a significant opioid dependence by gender interaction, such that men with current opioid dependence exhibited significantly lower levels of DT than women with opioid dependence and men without a history of opioid dependence. Conclusions/Importance: Findings highlight a modifiable characteristic associated with opioid dependence among men that may be targeted in interventions.

While a great deal of research has focused on risk factors predicting onset, there has been little research focused on risk factors influencing continued dependence on substances in adulthood following onset early in life. Purpose/Objectives: The present study examined poly-victimization and developmental patterns of anxiety as predictors of continued substance dependence problems. Methods: The Pathways to Desistance data were used in the present study. A subset of this sample was used in analyses comprising 261 juvenile offenders who reported lifetime drug and/or alcohol dependence at baseline. Firth logistic regression was used to estimate the impact that covariates had on the odds that individuals in this subsample had continued substance dependence in adulthood. Results: Results indicated that increased poly-victimization score pertaining to direct victimization at baseline was associated with increased odds of continued substance dependence problems in adulthood. Further, presentation of high and chronic anxiety symptomatology during adolescence was associated with increased risk for continued dependence. Conclusions/Importance: Drug dependent adolescents who demonstrate chronic anxiety and/or have experienced polyvictimization are at-risk for continuity of dependent in adulthood. Youth should be screened for these issues and targeted with treatment.

Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation-Paired Rehabilitation for Oromotor Feeding Problems in Newborns: An Open-Label Pilot Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						77	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00077			MAR 18 2020	2020	Neonates born premature or who suffer brain injury at birth often have oral feeding dysfunction and do not meet oral intake requirements needed for discharge. Low oral intake volumes result in extended stays in the hospital (>2 months) and can lead to surgical implant and explant of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). Prior work suggests pairing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with motor activity accelerates functional improvements after stroke, and transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) has emerged as promising noninvasive form of VNS. Pairing taVNS with bottle-feeding rehabilitation may improve oromotor coordination and lead to improved oral intake volumes, ultimately avoiding the need for G-tube placement. We investigated whether taVNS paired with oromotor rehabilitation is tolerable and safe and facilitates motor learning in infants who have failed oral feeding. We enrolled 14 infants [11 premature and 3 hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)] who were slated for G-tube placement in a prospective, open-label study of taVNS-paired rehabilitation to increase feeding volumes. Once-daily taVNS was delivered to the left tragus during bottle feeding for 2 weeks, with optional extension. The primary outcome was attainment of oral feeding volumes and weight gain adequate for discharge without G-tube while also monitoring discomfort and heart rate (HR) as safety outcomes. We observed no adverse events related to stimulation, and stimulation-induced HR reductions were transient and safe and likely confirmed vagal engagement. Eight of 14 participants (57%) achieved adequate feeding volumes for discharge without G-tube (mean treatment length: 16 +/- 6 days). We observed significant increases in feeding volume trajectories in responders compared with pre-stimulation (p < 0.05). taVNS-paired feeding rehabilitation appears safe and may improve oral feeding in infants with oromotor dyscoordination, increasing the rate of discharge without G-tube, warranting larger controlled trials.

The Effectiveness of Home-Based Training Software Designed to Influence Strategic Navigation Preferences in Healthy Subjects								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						76	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00076			MAR 17 2020	2020	One approach to the rehabilitation of navigation impairments is to train the use of compensatory egocentric or allocentric navigation strategies. Yet, it is unknown whether and to what degree training programs can influence strategic navigation preferences. In validating this approach, the key assumption that strategic preference can be changed by using a navigation training was assessed in a group of healthy participants (n = 82). The training program consisted of a psychoeducation session and a software package that included either allocentric or egocentric navigation exercises in virtual environments. Strategic navigation preference, objective and self-reported spatial abilities were assessed in pre- and post-training sessions. Based on their pre-training strategic preference, participants received either the egocentric training (n = 19) or the allocentric training (n = 21) version of the training. These participants engaged in four training sessions over a period of 2-3 weeks. The second group of participants did not use the training software (n = 43) and served as a control group. The results show that 50% of participants that received the egocentric training shifted from an allocentric to and an egocentric strategic preference. The proportion of participants that switched their strategic preference as a result of the allocentric training was identical to this proportion in the control group (19%). The training did not affect objective and self-reported navigation abilities as measured in the pre- and post-training sessions. We conclude that strategic navigation preferences can be influenced by using home-based training in healthy participants. However, using the current approach, only a preference shift from an allocentric to an egocentric navigation strategy could be achieved. The effectiveness of this navigation strategy training should next be assessed in relevant patient populations.		[van der Kuil, Milan N. A.; Evers, Andrea W. M.; van der Ham, Ineke J.

Recent progress in computational electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has provided means to measure the early maturation of cortical activity. Our study aimed to explore whether computational metrics of early sequential EEG recordings could reflect early nutritional care measured by energy and macronutrient intake in the first week of life. A higher energy or macronutrient intake was assumed to associate with improved development of the cortical activity. We analyzed multichannel EEG recorded at 32 weeks (32.4 +/- 0.7) and 36 weeks (36.6 +/- 0.9) of postmenstrual age in a cohort of 28 preterm infants born before 32 weeks of postmenstrual age (range: 24.3-32 weeks). We computed several quantitative EEG measures from epochs of quiet sleep (QS): (i) spectral power; (ii) continuity; (iii) interhemispheric synchrony, as well as (iv) the recently developed estimate of maturational age. Parenteral nutritional intake from day 1 to day 7 was monitored and clinical factors collected. Lower calories and carbohydrates were found to correlate with a higher reduction of spectral amplitude in the delta band. Lower protein amount associated with higher discontinuity. Both higher proteins and lipids intake correlated with a more developmental increase in interhemispheric synchrony as well as with better progress in the estimate of EEG maturational age (EMA). Our study shows that early nutritional balance after preterm birth may influence subsequent maturation of brain activity in a way that can be observed with several intuitively reasoned and transparent computational EEG metrics. Such measures could become early functional biomarkers that hold promise for benchmarking in the future development of therapeutic interventions.

J	Ng, Nicole F.; Schafer, Robert J.; Simone, Christa M.; Osman, Allen M.								Perceptions of Brain Training: Public Expectations of Cognitive Benefits From Popular Activities								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						15	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00015			MAR 17 2020	2020	Many popular activities are thought by the general public to improve cognitive function. Such expectations can influence how often people engage in these activities, as well as the scientific evaluation of their putative cognitive benefits, e.g., via placebo effects. Here, we gathered survey data about the public's perceptions of nine different activities commonly thought to be cognitively stimulating, including "brain-training" games. Information was collected about the degree to which participants thought each activity was beneficial for improving cognitive function and how often they engaged in each activity. The patterns of correlation between ratings reveal details about the perception of cognitive benefits and its relation to engagement. They suggest that participants varied with respect to an overarching perception of the entire set of activities, which were perceived also as divided into three clusters. Frequency of engagement and perceived cognitive benefits were positively correlated across participants for each activity considered individually. But, when the activities were compared, the magnitude of their perceived benefits was not a good predictor of their frequency of engagement (and vice versa). Though small, there were systematic demographic differences. Women were more optimistic than men about cognitive benefits. Individual participants differed in the range of their ratings of benefit across activities, and these ranges were greater for younger than older participants, suggesting that perceptions of benefit are more differentiated among the young. Besides contributing to a better understanding of public expectations of cognitive benefits, the findings of this study are relevant to the critical evaluation of such benefits. Our survey can be viewed as providing an interface between expectations held by the general public and the design of studies examining the efficacy of cognitive training. The type of information it provides could be used in the selection of activities performed by an active control group, so that control activities match the treatment intervention as closely as possible with respect to such expectations.

However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of such modulation remain insufficiently explored. The present study combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the modulation of activity across the language network following continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left pars opercularis. In 10 healthy subjects (21 +/- 2 years old, four females), neuronavigated cTBS was delivered over the left pars opercularis of the frontal operculum (part of the traditional Broca's area) at 80% of active motor threshold (AMT) stimulation intensity. Real cTBS and sham cTBS were performed in two different visits separated by at least 48 h. Before, immediately, and 10 min after cTBS, 30 single pulses of TMS were delivered to the left pars opercularis at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT), whereas EEG was simultaneously recorded. We examined the cTBS-induced modulation of phase locking values (PLVs) between the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded over the pars opercularis and those recorded over its right-hemispheric homolog area, the left supramarginal area, and the left superior temporal area in different EEG frequency bands and different time windows following cTBS. cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced within the gamma band: (1) a significant increase in TEP phase synchronization between the left and right pars opercularis at an early time window (250-350 ms) following cTBS; and (2) significantly increased PLV with the left supramarginal area and the left superior temporal area at a later time window (600-700 ms). In the theta and delta band, cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced significantly increased phase synchronization of TEPs between the left pars opercularis and the posterior left hemispheric language areas at a late time window. In sham condition, there was a significant decrease in TEP phase synchronization of the high beta band between left pars opercularis and left superior temporal area at 200-300 ms. These results contribute to characterize the dynamics of the language network and may have implications in the development of noninvasive stimulation protocols to promote the language rehabilitation in aphasia patients.

Cognitive Mapping Without Vision: Comparing Wayfinding Performance After Learning From Digital Touchscreen-Based Multimodal Maps vs. Embossed Tactile Overlays								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						87	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00087			MAR 17 2020	2020	This article starts by discussing the state of the art in accessible interactive maps for use by blind and visually impaired (BVI) people. It then describes a behavioral experiment investigating the efficacy of a new type of low-cost, touchscreen-based multimodal interface, called a vibro-audio map (VAM), for supporting environmental learning, cognitive map development, and wayfinding behavior on the basis of nonvisual sensing. In the study, eight BVI participants learned two floor-maps of university buildings, one using the VAM and the other using an analogous hardcopy tactile map (HTM) overlaid on the touchscreen. They were asked to freely explore each map, with the task of learning the entire layout and finding three hidden target locations. After meeting a learning criterion, participants performed an environmental transfer test, where they were brought to the corresponding physical layout and were asked to plan/navigate routes between learned target locations from memory, i.e., without access to the map used at learning. The results using Bayesian analyses aimed at assessing equivalence showed highly similar target localization accuracy and route efficiency performance between conditions, suggesting that the VAM supports the same level of environmental learning, cognitive map development, and wayfinding performance as is possible from interactive displays using traditional tactile map overlays. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the VAM for supporting complex spatial tasks without vision using a commercially available, low-cost interface and open the door to a new era of mobile interactive maps for spatial learning and wayfinding by BVI navigators.

Yet, the neural mechanisms that allow for increased performance under demanding conditions are not fully understood. We expected that post-training efficiency in WM performance modulates neural processing during high load tasks. We tested this hypothesis, using electroencephalography (EEG) (N = 39), by comparing source space spectral power of healthy adults performing low and high load auditory WM tasks. Prior to the assessment, participants either underwent a modality-specific auditory WM training, or a modality-irrelevant tactile WM training, or were not trained (active control). After a modality-specific training participants showed higher behavioral performance, compared to the control. EEG data analysis revealed general effects of WM load, across all training groups, in the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands. With increased load theta-band power increased over frontal, and decreased over parietal areas. Centro-parietal alpha-band power and central beta-band power decreased with load. Interestingly, in the high load condition a tendency toward reduced beta-band power in the right medial temporal lobe was observed in the modality-specific WM training group compared to the modality-irrelevant and active control groups. Our finding that WM processing during the high load condition changed after modality-specific WM training, showing reduced beta-band activity in voice-selective regions, possibly indicates a more efficient maintenance of task-relevant stimuli. The general load effects suggest that WM performance at high load demands involves complementary mechanisms, combining a strengthening of task-relevant and a suppression of task-irrelevant processing.

However, the efficacy of current strategies to fight against doping might be improved by using anti-doping polices tailored to the features of doping in each sport. Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to analyze the substances more commonly found in doping control tests in individual and team sports. Material and Methods: The publicly accessible Testing Figures Reports made available by the World Anti-Doping Agency, were analyzed from 2014 to 2017. Results: The most commonly detected groups of banned substances were anabolic agents and stimulants but the distribution of adverse findings per drug class was very different depending on the sports discipline. Weightlifting, athletics, rugby, hockey and volleyball presented abnormally high proportions of anabolic agents (p = 2.8 x 10(-11)). Cycling, athletics and rugby presented atypically elevated proportions of peptide hormones and growth factors (p = 1.4 x 10(-1)). Diuretics and masking agents were more commonly found in boxing, wrestling, taekwondo, judo, shooting, and gymnastics than in other sports (p = 4.0 x 10(-68)). Cycling, rowing, aquatics, tennis, gymnastics and ice hockey presented abnormally high proportions of stimulants (p = 1.8 x 10(-5)). Conclusions: These results indicate that the groups of banned substances more commonly detected in anti-doping control tests were different depending on the sports discipline. These data suggest the prohibited substances used as doping agents might be substantially different depending on the type of sport and thus, sports-specific anti-doping policies should be implemented to enhance the efficacy of anti-doping testing.

All stakeholders involved in fighting the opioid epidemic, from medical providers to policy makers, will benefit from understanding what contributes to overdoses. Recently incarcerated individuals represent a particularly vulnerable population. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of Jefferson County Coroner data for overdose deaths by postmortem toxicology between January 2017 and December 2018. Patients were cross-referenced with Jefferson County Department of Corrections (DOC) records, with inclusion of individuals with violations after January 2016 to focus on recently incarcerated individuals. We analyzed substances found in toxicology reports and substance risk level assigned based on screening by the DOC. Results: A total of 575 opioid overdose deaths occurred in Jefferson County from 2017-2018, with 55 of these individuals having interaction with the DOC after January 1, 2016. DOC population individuals had statistically significant higher findings of amphetamines/methamphetamines. Individuals from the DOC population had higher frequencies of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and cannabinoid/THC; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Prisoners with substance risk assessment scores of high or very high had fewer days from release to overdose death. Conclusion: Fentanyl remains a major contributor to overdose death, including those recently incarcerated. Substance risk assessment tools should drive referral for treatment while in prison and at time of release. These results provide better insight into the opioid epidemic and may help guide medical care, specifically for recently incarcerated individuals.

However, few studies to date have examined the shared risk factors that may contribute to this common comorbidity. Therefore, the current investigation tested the indirect effect of trait anxiety on drug use disorder symptoms via emotion dysregulation, a widely recognized transdiagnostic risk factor found to be relevant across both anxiety and illicit drug use. Method: The sample was comprised of 241 adults (M-age = 50.56, SDage = 5.90; 76.8% Black) recruited from a community center serving low-income and homeless individuals. Results: Consistent with our hypothesis, structural equation modeling demonstrated an indirect effect of trait anxiety on drug use disorder symptoms through emotion dysregulation. Conclusions: The current findings show initial support for emotion dysregulation as an explanatory vulnerability factor indirectly underlying the relationship between anxiety and drug use.

This study investigated how these two types of external interference affect task performance and attentional and WM processes as indexed by specific event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. A Continuous Number Task (CNT) was applied, in which participants had to either decide whether the current number (condition without WM load) or the sum of the current and the preceding number (condition with WM load) was odd or even while responding to interlaced single letters (interruptions) or ignoring them (distractions). Contrary to previous research, we did not find external interference to affect performance under WM load. Unexpectedly, our results rather show that performance was significantly improved in trials after distractions compared to before. This effect was reflected particularly in a significantly increased P3 mean amplitude indicating enhanced attentional reallocation to task-relevant stimuli. Interestingly, this P3 effect appeared independent of WM load and also following interruptions. This underpins the account of P3 amplitudes being modulated by the interval between two task-relevant stimuli rather than by overall task-difficulty. Moreover, a pronounced fronto-central and posterior slow wave following interference suggest more control resources to maintain task-relevant stimuli in WM independent of the preceding interfering stimulus. Our results thus suggest that the type and foreknowledge of external interference may modulate the amount of interference and may also facilitate resource preparation under WM load.

Personality characteristics and cognitive appraisals associated with self-discrepancy after severe traumatic brain injury								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				30	3			393	411		10.1080/09602011.2018.1469416			MAR 15 2020	2020	Although changes to self-identity or self-discrepancy are common after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), the mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the influence of personality characteristics and cognitive appraisals on self-discrepancy. Participants were 51 adults (74% male) with severe TBI (Mage = 36.22 years;SD = 12.65) who were on average 34 months (SD = 40.29) post-injury. They completed self-report measures of personality style (optimism and defensiveness), cognitive appraisals (threat appraisals, rumination and reflection and perceived coping resources), and self-discrepancy (Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale - III). Correlation analyses identified that higher levels of optimism, defensiveness and perceived coping resources were significantly associated with more positive self-discrepancy (r = .29-.47,p < .05), whereas higher threat appraisals and rumination were significantly related to more negative self- discrepancy (r = -.50-.57,p < .001). After controlling for personality characteristics, cognitive appraisals significantly accounted for self-discrepancy (R(2)change = .15). Moreover, rumination significantly mediated the relationship between optimism and self-discrepancy. In summary, cognitive appraisals were found to be related to self-discrepancy, independent of personality characteristics. Rumination in particular may be an important target of psychological intervention for individuals experiencing negative self-discrepancy.		[Beadle, Elizabeth Jane; Ownsworth, Tamara; Shum, David H.

Memory skills groups (MSGs) utilising compensatory strategies and computerised cognitive training (CCT) are two rehabilitation approaches available to improve memory function; however, there is no consensus as to which is more effective following stroke. This study aimed to explore and contrast the qualitative experiences of 20 stroke survivors (M-age = 61.90,SD = 10.48, range: 34-77 years) who received six weeks' training in MSG (manualised memory skills group,n = 10) or individual-CCT (Lumosity(TM),n = 10). Using semi-structured interviews, data were collected and analysed thematically, adopting a critical realist approach. Six themes were identified: (1)Facilitators and barriers to intervention engagement, (2)Improving knowledge and understanding, (3)Connecting with others, (4)Perception of the intervention, (5)Impact on everyday memoryand (6)Impact on emotions and sense of purpose. Encouragingly, most participants valued and enjoyed participating in the memory interventions, irrespective of rehabilitation approach. MSG participants reported learning and sharing with similar others as important to the experience and described everyday memory improvements. CCT participants described enjoyment of its game-like nature, yet reported frustration associated with game-specific characteristics, and did not report everyday memory improvements.

Attention Process Training-3 to improve reading comprehension in mild aphasia: A single-case experimental design study								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				30	3			430	461		10.1080/09602011.2018.1477683			MAR 15 2020	2020	People with aphasia frequently present with nonlinguistic deficits, in addition to their compromised language abilities, which may contribute to their problems with reading comprehension. Treatment of attention, working memory and executive control may improve reading comprehension in individuals with aphasia, particularly those with mild reading problems. This single-case experimental design study evaluated the efficacy of Attention Process Training-3, an intervention combining direct attention training and metacognitive facilitation, for improving reading comprehension in individuals with mild aphasia. A multiple baseline design across six participants was used to evaluate treatment effects. The primary outcome measure was a maze reading task. Cognitive measures were administered pre- and post-treatment. Visual inspection of graphed maze reading performance data indicated a basic effect between APT-3 and improved maze reading for three of the six participants. Quantitative analyses, using Tau-U, corroborated findings identified through visual analysis. The overall effect size was significant (Tau = .48,p = .01). Results suggest that APT-3 has the potential to improve reading in individuals with aphasia, but that it may be more efficacious under certain conditions. Treatment and participant variables, including intensity of treatment and metacognitive strategy usage, are discussed as potential influences on participants' responsiveness to APT-3.

Both children were slow in reading single words and text and had difficulty in spelling irregularly spelled words. One child was also poor in non-word reading. Intervention focused on spelling in a whole-word training using a flashcard technique that had previously been found to be effective with English-speaking children. Post-intervention assessments conducted immediately at the end of the intervention, one month later and then five months later showed a significant improvement in spelling of treated words that was sustained over time. In addition, both children showed generalisation of improvement to untrained words and an increase in scores in a standardised spelling assessment. The findings support the effectiveness of theoretically based targeted intervention for literacy difficulties.

An effective service response to reduce this trend requires collaboration between the ABI and criminal justice (CJ) sectors. The Building Bridges project piloted a novel professional development model designed to increase cross-sectoral knowledge and collaboration between the ABI and CJ sectors. A total of 178 service providers from Victoria, Australia, participated in six professional development forums that included content about ABI, policing, disability and legal supports, and correctional/post-release services. Participants came from the disability, criminal justice, and health and community service sectors. Using a pre-test-post-test design with 6-month follow-up, data were obtained via a project-specific questionnaire evaluating knowledge and behaviour change among participants. Statistically significant gains in knowledge were shown at post-test and maintained at follow-up. Work-related behaviours addressing ABI/CJ issues had increased significantly within both sectors at follow-up compared to the 6 months prior to the forum. Carefully constructed professional forums improved cross-silo collaboration in the ABI/CJ sectors. This pilot project illustrates effective use of existing service resources, and highlights training as an important part of a raft of initiatives needed to address the overrepresentation of people with ABI in the CJ system.

This qualitative study aimed to understand the RTW experience of individuals with TBI who received comprehensive vocational rehabilitation, and to identify facilitating and limiting factors in the RTW process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 individuals (mean age = 47.33 years) approximately 4.5 years post-injury, of whom 14 had moderate to severe TBI. Twelve individuals had successfully returned to work. Thematic analysis of transcribed interviews identified three key factors affecting RTW: client, work and rehabilitation factors. Across these factors, 12 themes reported to be critical to the success or failure of the RTW programme were identified. Client themes included social support, cognitive difficulties and motivation, with RTW too early associated with unfavourable outcomes. Work themes included work modifications, employer support and financial incentives. Rehabilitation themes included the RTW programme, the role of the vocational occupational therapist and work preparation. These key factors were reported to have impacted the RTW outcome, comprising three further themes: work satisfaction, future vocational outlook, and quality of life. Consideration of these factors can inform vocational rehabilitation programmes, potentially improving employment outcomes following TBI.

This study comprises two parts that describe and assess an immersive VR task, theVirtual Shop, which can be used to measure episodic memory. Part 1 addresses its applicability in healthy older adults by measuring presence, motivation, and cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task, and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in theVirtual Shop, in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence, higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task, and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups, and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus, the use of VR is feasible in older adults and theVirtual Shopis a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.

A study of the subjective experience of cognitive training would provide another type of valuable information concerning the effects of rehabilitation. We used grounded theory methods to explore the experience and management of attention dysfunction in daily life two-four years after brain injury. Data were collected by in-depth interviews of 14 adults with moderate-to-mild attention dysfunction after stroke or traumatic brain injury, and working part time or full time at the time of the interviews. The group received 20 hours of attention process training within the context of multidisciplinary rehabilitation early after brain injury. Data were analysed by open coding with constant comparison. The management of attention dysfunction was described by the informants as a dynamic process where strategies are continuously refined and flexibly adjusted as awareness and metacognitive knowledge increases. This process is regulated by situation-dependent factors. Attention process training might provide a suitable starting point for the identification of problem areas, improved specific goalsetting and stimulated self-training. The model describes the dynamic nature of the process, the ongoing struggle, self-training and search for feedback.

The primary focus was to determine differences in perceptions between qualified (N = 40) and direct care staff (N = 47). Vignettes depicting ISB displayed by a male following a TBI were rated. The vignettes varied in behaviour (intimate versus non-contact) and age of the victim (child versus adult). Ratings for causal explanations (poor management, attention seeking, negative emotion and education), attributions (need for action and increase awareness) and emotions were analysed alongside risk assessment and management variables. Intimate contact ISB and ISB directed towards a child were perceived to be more serious and in need of intervention. Direct care staff perceived ISB to be due to sexual motivations, poor emotion control and to seek attention. They elicited greater negative emotions and based their judgements of risk on seriousness. On the other hand, qualified staff were more concerned about implementing interventions based on the risk of recurrence. Differences between staff groups could cause conflict regarding the assessment and management of ISB in TBI. Training to increase awareness of the behaviour could minimise differences and produce greater cohesion within clinical practise.

Ukraine falls in the highest WHO category of "years of life lost" due to alcohol use. Objective: To investigate perceptions of alcohol consumption in a sample of youth and adults in western Ukraine. Methods: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 adult stakeholders (aged 21-63 years), and 81 adolescents and young adults (aged 12-21 years) completed paper-and-pencil open-ended questions. A combined deductive-inductive thematic analysis of these qualitative data resulted in an initial coding scheme for both parts of the data. These initial codes were organized into patterns, which were further condensed to four themes. Results: The four themes that were developed are: (1) The general historical, socio-economic-political situation and its relation to alcohol use, (2) Alcohol in the home and daily environment, (3) Alcohol use, related feelings, peers, family, and burden to health, and (4) Perceptions of the consequences of alcohol (mis)use. Conclusions: Respondents indicated awareness that daily consumption, also in youth, as well as binge drinking and childhood sipping constitute a risk to health. These risks were described in the context of easy availability, low pricing, and peer pressure. The respondents mentioned awareness that alcohol dependence (AD) of parents affected families with the risk of disadvantageous child development. Interventions may include targeting current norms, stigmatizing beliefs and supporting subjects in developing coping skills.		[Toornstra, A.; Hurks, P. P.

The typical and atypical drinking diary (TADD) was developed to benefit from each method's advantages. Objectives: To compare estimates obtained from the TADD with corresponding estimates obtained from a QF measure (Khavari alcohol test; KAT) and an RD measure, the timeline follow-back (TLFB). It was hypothesized that the TADD's alcohol consumption estimates would correlate strongly with those obtained from the TLFB; and the strength of the TADD-TLFB correlation would be significantly stronger than the KAT-TLFB correlation. Method: One hundred and sixty-eight (168) undergraduates (73% female) estimated their alcohol consumption for the preceding 12 weeks using all three measures. Results: The TADD (r = 0.83, p < .001) and the KAT (r = 0.066, p < .001) produced estimates of total alcohol consumption that correlated very strongly and strongly, respectively, with the TLFB. Notably, the TADD-TLFB correlation was significantly stronger than the KAT-TLFB correlation (Z = 5.10, p < .001). Moreover, the TADD's estimates of number of drinking days (r = 0.70, p < .001) and heavy drinking episodes per week (0.77, p < .001) correlated strongly with corresponding estimates from the TLFB. The TADD and KAT provided higher estimates of alcohol consumption than the TLFB. Conclusion: Clinicians and researchers should consider using the TADD to estimate alcohol consumption in time-limited situations.

However, the direct contact between the metal contacts of the DBS electrode and the brain can cause RF heating in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, due to an increase of local specific absorption rate (SAR). Recently, micro coils (mu MS) have demonstrated excitation of neuronal tissue through the electromagnetic induction both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast to electrical stimulation, in mu MS, there is no direct contact between the metal and the biological tissue. Methods We compared the heating of a mu MS coil with a control case of a metal wire. The heating was induced by RF fields in a 1.5 T MRI head birdcage coil (often used for imaging patients with implants) at 64 MHz, and normalized results to 3.2 W/kg whole head average SAR. Results The mu MS coil or wire implants were placed inside an anatomically accurate head saline-gel filled phantom inserted in the RF coil, and we observed approximately 1 degrees C initial temperature rise at the mu MS coil, while the wire exhibited a 10 degrees C temperature rise in the proximity of the exposed end. The numerical simulations showed a 32-times increase of local SAR induced at the tips of the metal wire compared to the mu MS. Conclusion In this work, we show with measurements and electromagnetic numerical simulations that the RF-induced increase in local SAR and induced heating during MRI scanning can be greatly reduced by using magnetic stimulation with the proposed mu MS technology.

While some studies suggest that increased naloxone accessibility reduces opioid overdose deaths, others raise concerns about unintended consequences, such as increases in risky drug use and opioid re-use post-overdose to counter naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms. Few studies have examined the impact of expanded naloxone access on the attitudes and behaviors of opioid users. Methods: In this qualitative study, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 36 English-speaking opioid users 18+ years of age. Informants were recruited from an urban methadone clinic, a needle exchange program and a residential treatment program. The approximately hour-long interviews focused on users' attitudes and behaviors surrounding naloxone, opioid use and overdose. Transcribed audio-recordings of interviews were analyzed using NVivo. Results: Informants were ambivalent about naloxone, widely acknowledging its life-saving benefits while reporting such negative effects as severe withdrawal symptoms and the promotion of riskier drug use. Naloxone-induced withdrawal, coupled with misperceptions about naloxone's pharmacological effects, prompted overdose survivors to rapidly re-use opioids and refuse hospitalization following an overdose reversal. About half the sample believed naloxone led to greater risk-taking by others, such as fentanyl use or use in higher quantities, but did not endorse riskier drug use themselves. Conclusions: The results suggest the need for targeted education about the pharmacological effects of naloxone and better strategies for managing naloxone-induced withdrawal. Future research should focus on the extent to which naloxone is associated with greater opioid risk-taking.

Here, we completed three experiments comparing the effects of tDCS and sham stimulation to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), M1, and the supplementary motor area complex to understand the contributions of these brain regions to motor sequence learning. In Experiment 1, we found that both left and right PFC tDCS groups displayed a slowing in learning in both reaction time and number of chunks, whereas stimulation over M1 improved both metrics over the course of three sessions. To better understand the sequence learning impairment of left PFC anodal stimulation, we tested a left PFC cathodal tDCS group in Experiment 2. The cathodal group demonstrated learning impairments similar to the left PFC anodal stimulation group. In Experiment 3, a subset of participants from the left PFC, M1, and sham tDCS groups of Experiment 1 returned to complete a single session without tDCS on the same sequences assigned to them 1 year previously. We found that the M1 tDCS group reduced reaction time at a faster rate relative to the sham and left PFC groups, demonstrating faster relearning after a one-year delay. Thus, our findings suggest that, regardless of the polarity of stimulation, tDCS to PFC impairs sequence learning, whereas stimulation to M1 facilitates learning and relearning, especially in terms of chunk formation.

Indirect measures of configural processing in visual cognition are the face and body inversion effects (FIE and BIE), which refer to the drop in performance when these stimuli are perceived upside-down. Albeit FIE and BIE have been well characterized at the behavioral level, much still needs to be understood in terms of the neurophysiological correlates of these effects. Thus, in the current study, the brain's electrical activity has been recorded by a 128 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 24 healthy participants while perceiving (upright and inverted) faces, bodies and houses. EEG data were analyzed in both the time domain (i.e., event-related potentials-ERPs) and the frequency domain [i.e., induced theta (5-7 Hz) and gamma (28-45 Hz) oscillations]. ERPs amplitude results showed increased N170 amplitude for inverted faces and bodies (compared to the same stimuli presented in canonical position) but not for houses. ERPs latency results showed delayed N170 components for inverted (vs. upright) faces, houses, but not bodies. Spectral analysis of induced oscillations indicated physiological FIE and BIE; that is decreased gamma-band synchronization over right occipito-temporal electrodes for inverted (vs. upright) faces, and increased bilateral frontoparietal theta-band synchronization for inverted (vs. upright) faces. Furthermore, increased left occipito-temporal and right frontal theta-band synchronization for upright (vs. inverted) bodies was found. Our findings, thus, demonstrate clear differences in the neurophysiological correlates of face and body perception. The neurophysiological FIE suggests disruption of feature binding processes (decrease in occipital gamma oscillations for inverted faces), together with enhanced feature-based attention (increase in frontoparietal theta oscillations for inverted faces). In contrast, the BIE may suggest that structural encoding for bodies is mediated by the first stages of configural processing (decrease in occipital theta oscillations for inverted bodies).

Verbal Working Memory as Emergent from Language Comprehension and Production								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						68	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00068			MAR 12 2020	2020	This article reviews current models of verbal working memory and considers the role of language comprehension and long-term memory in the ability to maintain and order verbal information for short periods of time. While all models of verbal working memory posit some interaction with long-term memory, few have considered the character of these long-term representations or how they might affect performance on verbal working memory tasks. Similarly, few models have considered how comprehension processes and production processes might affect performance in verbal working memory tasks. Modern theories of comprehension emphasize that people learn a vast web of correlated information about the language and the world and must activate that information from long-term memory to cope with the demands of language input. To date, there has been little consideration in theories of verbal working memory for how this rich input from comprehension would affect the nature of temporary memory. There has also been relatively little attention to the degree to which language production processes naturally manage serial order of verbal information. The authors argue for an emergent model of verbal working memory supported by a rich, distributed long-term memory for language. On this view, comprehension processes provide encoding in verbal working memory tasks, and production processes maintenance, serial ordering, and recall. Moreover, the computational capacity to maintain and order information varies with language experience. Implications for theories of working memory, comprehension, and production are considered.

However, little is known about whether there is a deficit in the relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and RT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method: We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 28 older adults with MCI and 28 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing an Eriksen flanker task. For each participant, single-trial prestimulus alpha power was calculated for combinations of congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and response speed (fast vs. slow). Result: Statistical analysis indicated that prestimulus alpha power was significantly lower for fast trials than slow trials in HCs but not in older adults with MCI. The Fisher's z scores of the within-subject correlation coefficients between single-trial prestimulus alpha power and RT were significantly larger in HCs than in older adults with MCI. In addition, machine learning analyses indicated that prestimulus alpha power and its correlation with RT could serve as features to distinguish older adults with MCI from HCs and to predict performance on some neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: The reduced correlation between prestimulus alpha activity and RT suggests that older adults with MCI experience impaired preparatory attention.

The present report aims to assess whether bilaterally symmetric synchronous activity between the two hemispheres is a characteristic of the infant brain. To asses cortical bilateral synchronicity, we used decomposition by independent component analysis (ICA) of high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected in an auditory passive oddball paradigm. Decompositions of concatenated 64-channel EEG data epochs from each of 34 typically developing 6-month-old infants and from 18 healthy young adults participating in the same passive auditory oddball protocol were compared to characterize differences in functional brain organization between early life and adulthood. Our results show that infant EEG decompositions comprised a larger number of independent component (IC) effective source processes compatible with a cortical origin and having bilaterally near-symmetric scalp projections (13.8% of the infant data ICs presented a bilateral pattern vs. 4.3% of the adult data ICs). These IC projections could be modeled as the sum of potentials volume-conducted to the scalp from synchronous locally coherent field activities in corresponding left and right cortical source areas. To conclude, in this paradigm, source-resolved infant brain EEG exhibited more bilateral synchronicity than EEG produced by the adult brain, supporting the hypothesis that more strongly unilateral and likely more functionally specialized unihemispheric cortical field activities are concomitants of brain maturation.

The present randomized controlled study investigated whether similar effects can be elicited through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) regarding the "self-serving bias" (SSB) and the "mnemic neglect effect" (MNE). Seventy-five healthy males (M-age = 25; SD = 4.3) were investigated in a between-groups design with random assignment by applying anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). After stimulation, the participants judged if 80 personality traits (40 positive, 40 negative) were self-descriptive or not. Finally, the participants had to recall the previously presented adjectives. All three stimulation groups showed the expected SSB and MNE. Still, and contrary to our hypotheses, tDCS revealed neither a significant interaction effect between groups and valence concerning the number of chosen self-referential traits (F-(2,F-72) = 1.36, p = 0.26, eta G2 = 0.02) nor an interaction effect between groups, valence, and self-reference concerning the percentage of recalled words (F-(2,F-71) = 0.69, p = 0.50, eta G2 = 0.01). However, a post hoc inspection of effect sizes revealed that less negative traits were indicated as self-referential in the anodal compared to the cathodal group (ES: -0.59; CI: -1.16 to -0.03). Moreover, the participants showed-regardless of self-reference and type of stimulation-a better recall with tDCS in comparison to sham stimulation. Our results indicate that tDCS of the mPFC in healthy young men has no influence on the SSB and the MNE. However, tDCS seems to improve memory performance.

The present study aimed to investigate the gray matter volume (GMV) changes in hemodialysis patients compared with those noted in healthy subjects, as well as explore the associated functional connectivity alterations based on the abnormal GMV regions. The experiments revealed the effects of regional morphometry aberrance on the brain functional integrity. A total of 46 hemodialysis patients (53.11 +/- 1.58 years, 28 males) and 47 healthy subjects (55.57 +/- 0.86 years, 22 males) were enrolled in the present study. All subjects underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging, resting-state functional MR imaging, and laboratory examinations were performed in hemodialysis patients. The GMV deficits were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regions with GMV alteration were defined as seeds for functional connectivity analysis. Correlation analyses between significantly different regions and the results of the blood examination were further performed. We found that bilateral thalamus exhibited significantly increased volumes in the hemodialysis patients compared with those of the healthy subjects. However, the bilateral rectus, bilateral caudate, and bilateral temporal gyrus demonstrated significantly decreased volumes. When the regions with GMV alterations were defined as seeds, the hemodialysis patients exhibited decreased integrations in the thalamo-cortical network and within the basal-ganglia connection. The present study revealed the presence of different types of structural and functional brain impairments in hemodialysis patients.

However, few well-controlled population-based studies compare alcohol use among nonveterans and veterans with diverse military service experiences, and no such study examines everyday drinking. Methods: We use population-representative data from the 2010 and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and distinguish four groups of men: nonveterans; non-combat veterans without a psychiatric disorder (PD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI); combat veterans without a PD or TBI; and veterans (non-combat and combat combined) with a PD and/or TBI. We estimate hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models of current drinking (N = 21,947) and daily drinking (among current drinkers; N = 11,491). Results from supplemental analyses are discussed. Results: Relative to nonveterans, non-combat veterans with no PD or TBI and veterans with a PD and/or TBI, respectively, but not combat veterans with no PD or TBI, are more likely to be current drinkers. Among current drinkers, non-combat and combat veterans with no PD or TBI, respectively, are less likely than nonveterans to be daily drinkers. Conversely, among current drinkers, veterans with a PD and/or TBI are more likely to be daily drinkers than nonveterans, non-combat veterans with no PD or TBI, and combat veterans with no PD or TBI. Conclusion: We document heterogeneous and countervailing influences of military service experiences on current and daily drinking. Results indicate that harmful military service experience may be associated with an increased risk of current, moderate daily drinking, which may represent a form of self-medication.

Can We Really Selectively Train Specific EEG Frequencies With Neurofeedback Training								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						22	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00022			MAR 10 2020	2020	Neurofeedback (NFB) is an operant conditioning procedure whereby an individual learns to self-regulate the electrical activity of his/her brain. Initially developed as a treatment intervention for pathologies with underlying EEG dysfunctions, NFB is also used as a training tool to enhance specific cognitive states required in high-performance situations. The original idea behind the NFB training effect is that the changes should only be circumscribed to the trained EEG frequencies. The EEG frequencies which are not used as feedback frequencies should be independent and not affected by the neurofeedback training. Despite the success of sensorimotor rhythm NFB training in cognitive performance enhancement, it remains unclear whether all participants can intentionally modify the power densities of specifically selected electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies. In the present study, participants were randomly assigned to either a control heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (HRV) training group or a combination of HRV biofeedback and neurofeedback (HRV/NFB) training group. This randomized mixed design experiment consisted of two introductory theoretical lessons and a training period of 6 weeks. We investigated the evolution of the different EEG frequency bands of our two experimental groups across and within session. All the participants exhibited EEG changes across and within session. However, within the HRV/NFB training group, untrained EEG frequencies have been significantly modified, unlike some of the trained frequencies. Moreover, EEG activity was modified in both the HRV group and the HRV/NFB groups. Hence, the EEG changes were not only circumscribed to the trained frequency bands or to the training modality.

Neurocognitive reorganization of emotional processing following a socio-cognitive intervention in Colombian ex-combatants								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	4			398	407		10.1080/17470919.2020.1735511			JUL 3 2020	2020	Ex-combatants often exhibit atypical Emotional Processing (EP) such as reduced emphatic levels and higher aggressive attitudes. Social Cognitive Training (SCT) addressing socio-emotional components powerfully improve social interaction among Colombian ex-combatants. However, with narrow neural evidence, this study offers a new testimony. A sample of 28 ex-combatants from Colombian illegal armed groups took part in this study, split into 15 for SCT and 13 for the conventional program offered by the Governmental Reintegration Route. All of them were assessed before and after the intervention with a protocol that included an EP task synchronized with electroencephalographic recordings. We drew behavioral scores and brain connectivity (Coherency) metrics from task performance. Behavioral scores yielded no significant effects. Increased post-intervention connectivity in the delta band was observed during negative emotional processing only SCT group. Positive emotions exposed distinctive gamma band connectivity that differentiate groups. These results suggest that SCT can trigger covert neurofunctional reorganization in ex-combatants embarked on the reintegration process even when overt behavioral improvements are not yet apparent. Such covert functional changes may be the neural signature of compensatory mechanisms necessary to reshape behaviors adaptively. This novel framework may inspire cutting-edge translational research at the crossing of neuroscience, sociology, and public policy-making.

The effects of two top-down aspects of the instruction on motor performance have not been fully resolved: those related to attention to the observed task and the incorporation of motor imagery (MI) during AO. In addition, the immediate vs. 24-h retention test effects of those instruction's aspects are yet to be elucidated. Forty-eight healthy subjects were randomly instructed to: (1) observe reaching movement (RM) sequences toward five lighted units with the intention of reproducing the same sequence as fast and as accurate as possible (Intentional + Attentional group; AO+At); (2) observe the RMs sequence with the intention of reproducing the same sequence as fast and as accurate as possible and simultaneously to the observation to imagine performing the RMs (Intentional + attentional + MI group; AO+At+MI); and (3) observe the RMs sequence (Passive AO group). Subjects' performance was tested before and immediately after the AO and retested after 24 h. During each of the pretest, posttest, and retest, the subject performed RMs toward the units that were activated in the same order as the observed sequence. Occasionally, the sequence order was changed by beginning the sequence with a different activated unit. The outcome measures were: averaged response time of the RMs during the sequences, difference between the response time of the unexpected and expected RMs and percent of failures to reach the target within 1 s. The averaged response time and the difference between the response time of the unexpected and expected RMs were improved in all groups at posttest compared to pretest, regardless of instruction. Averaged response time was improved in the retest compared to the posttest only in the Passive AO group. The percent of failures across groups was higher in pretest compared to retest. Our findings suggest that manipulating top-down aspects of instruction by adding attention and MI to AO in an RM sequence task does not improve subsequent performance more than passive observation. Off-line learning of the sequence in the retention test was improved in comparison to posttest following passive observation only.

Despite growing concerns about the alcohol consumption among American adolescents, not many studies have examined the correlates and predictors of their alcohol behaviors. Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to explore the relationship between drinking behaviors, parental intervention, low self-control, and opportunity. Methods: Based on the theoretical framework of Gottfreson and Hirschi's (1990) theory, this study conducted Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with a national American youth data (N = 5,030). Results: Results in this study were consistent with previous empirical studies, supporting the general theory of crime. In addition, this study found the role of parental intervention in the theory was significant: particularly, decreases in low self-control, opportunity, and drinking behaviors. Further, the significant moderation between low self-control and opportunity on underage drinking was found in this study. Conclusion: Those findings will provide a solution to reduce drinking problems among American adolescents.

This may be explained by differential relationships between SA and context-specific AOE. Gender may further moderate these associations, as it influences SA, AOE, and drinking behaviors. Objectives: To examine the moderating role of drinking context (i.e. convivial, negative coping, or personal-intimate) and gender on the relationships between SA and three AOE (i.e. tension reduction, sociability, and sexuality). Methods: Participants (n = 436, M-age=19.32, 72% female, 85.8% White) were 218 undergraduates with elevated SA (high SA group) and a gender-matched low SA group (n = 218) drawn from a larger undergraduate sample (N = 1,015). Participants completed three versions of an AOE measure, differing by drinking context considered. Results: A significant SA group x context x gender interaction was found for tension reduction AOE; compared to men, women in the low SA group reported greater tension reduction AOE in negative coping contexts. Significant SA group and context main effects suggest that sociability and sexuality AOE are endorsed more in the high (vs. low) SA group, and in convivial and personal-intimate compared to negative coping contexts. Conclusions/Importance: Tension reduction AOE vary depending on the drinking context, SA, and gender. Assessment of AOE in specific drinking contexts may help to identify which individuals may be at greatest risk for alcohol misuse and help inform treatment of SA-related problem drinking.

The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course and the neural correlate of statistical learning of positional consistency in Chinese orthography. Visual ERPs were recorded, while Chinese adults performed an orthographic statistical learning task involving artificial characters varying in high, moderate, and low levels of positional consistency. The negative ERP deflection at the N1 time window, typically linked with orthographic regularity processing, was found in orthographic statistical learning with the low and moderate consistencies eliciting larger neural responses than the high consistency in the time window of 150-210 ms over occipital-temporal brain areas. These results suggest that orthographic statistical learning begins within the first 210 ms and that the N1 might be its neural indicator.

It is known that the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to PD, while the exact impact of this on the brain dynamics is not fully understood, the presence of beta-band oscillatory activity is thought to be pathological. The cause of ET, however, remains uncertain, however pathological oscillations in the thalamocortical-cerebellar network have been linked to tremor. Both of these movement disorders are treated with DBS, which entails the surgical implantation of electrodes into a patient's brain. While DBS leads to an improvement in symptoms for many patients, the mechanisms underlying this improvement is not clearly understood, and computational modeling has been used extensively to improve this. Many of the models used to study DBS and its effect on the human brain have mainly utilized single neuron and single axon biophysical models. We have previously shown in separate models however, that the use of population models can shed much light on the mechanisms of the underlying pathological neural activity in PD and ET in turn, and on the mechanisms underlying DBS. Together, this work suggested that the dynamics of the cerebellar-basal ganglia thalamocortical network support oscillations at frequency range relevant to movement disorders. Here, we propose a new combined model of this network and present new results that demonstrate that both Parkinsonian oscillations in the beta band and oscillations in the tremor frequency range arise from the dynamics of such a network. We find regions in the parameter space demonstrating the different dynamics and go on to examine the transition from one oscillatory regime to another as well as the impact of DBS on these different types of pathological activity. This work will allow us to better understand the changes in brain activity induced by DBS, and allow us to optimize this clinical therapy, particularly in terms of target selection and parameter setting.

There is increasing interest in the use of driving simulators for driver rehabilitation post-ABI; however, there is still limited research demonstrating efficacy and acceptability. This study sought to examine the user experience of a driving simulator intervention for ABI survivors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 individuals, including 12 ABI survivors (42% male; Mean age = 53.92 years, SD age = 17.63) who completed the intervention, and 2 occupational therapist driver assessors who facilitated the intervention. Thematic analysis was adopted to analyse interview data. Findings suggest that individual differences (e.g., anxiety, previous experience) influenced participant response to training. The intervention allowed participants to practise various driving skills, re-familiarize themselves with the task of driving, and prepare for return to on-road driving within a safe environment. The intervention was perceived to be useful for enhancing driver self-awareness, autonomy, confidence and patience.

Overall, the simulator intervention was reported to be a positive experience for participants. Themes emerging from this study can inform future driving simulator interventions for ABI survivors.

The Great Disrupter: Relationship of Alexithymia to Emotion Regulation Processes and Smoking among Pregnant Women								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	7			1113	1121		10.1080/10826084.2020.1729198			APR 15 2020	2020	Background: Many women continue to smoke during pregnancy, despite known risks, often in response to negative affect. Recent scholarship has begun to examine factors that decrease the success of behavioral treatments for smoking cessation in pregnancy, which are the preferred interventions. Alexithymia is one factor that may interfere with smoking cessation interventions. Alexithymia restricts access to emotional information and increases propensity toward maladaptive behaviors, including smoking. However, mechanisms underlying such effects are largely unknown. Objectives: Using data from a longitudinal treatment study, the present research examined difficulties with emotion regulation as a potential mechanism linking alexithymia and smoking. Pregnant smokers (n = 73; mean age = 24.78; SD = 4.50) completed measures related to alexithymia, smoking, emotion regulation, depression, anxiety, and anger at baseline and then again following eight sessions of Cognitive-Behavioral Smoking Cessation Treatment. Results: Nearly 40% of the sample met the criteria for alexithymia. The alexithymia group reported higher depression, anxiety, and anger. They also reported more difficulties with emotion regulation. In a path analysis, baseline alexithymia had a significant positive indirect effect on number of cigarettes smoked at the end of treatment through difficulties with emotion regulation. Conclusions/Importance: Similar to other studies, alexithymia limits the understanding of emotional information necessary for selection and implementation of adaptive coping responses. Our results extend the literature by suggesting that smoking may be an attempt to manage undifferentiated and unpleasant sensations created by alexithymia.

This stimulation can be non-invasive and may be a simple technology to enhance proprioception. In this study, we investigated whether sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors reduces age-related errors in wrist position estimation. Fifteen young (24.5 +/- 1.5y) and 23 elderly (71.7 +/- 7.3y) unimpaired, right-handed adults completed a wrist position gauge-matching experiment. In each trial, the participant's concealed wrist was moved to a target position between 10 and 30 degrees of wrist flexion or extension by a robotic manipulandum. The participant then estimated the wrist's position on a virtual gauge. During half of the trials, sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation was applied to the wrist muscle tendon areas. Stochastic stimulation did not significantly influence wrist position sense. In the elderly group, estimation errors decreased non-significantly when stimulation was applied compared to the trials without stimulation [mean constant error reduction Delta mu(theta conof)=0.8 degrees in flexion and Delta mu(theta conoe)=0.7 degrees in extension direction, p = 0.95]. This effect was less pronounced in the young group [Delta mu(theta cony)=0.2 degrees in flexion and in extension direction, p = 0.99]. These improvements did not yield a relevant effect size (Cohen's d < 0.1). Estimation errors increased with target angle magnitude in both movement directions. In young participants, estimation errors were non-symmetric, with estimations in flexion [mu(theta conyf)=1.8 degrees, sigma(theta conyf)=7.0 degrees] being significantly more accurate than in extension [mu(theta conye)=8.3 degrees, sigma(theta conye)=9.3 degrees, p < 0.01]. This asymmetry was not present in the elderly group, where estimations in flexion [mu(theta conof)=7.5 degrees, sigma(theta conof)=9.8 degrees] were similar to extension [mu(theta conoe)=7.7 degrees, sigma(theta conoe)=9.3 degrees]. Hence, young and elderly participants performed equally in extension direction, whereas wrist position sense in flexion direction deteriorated with age (p < 0.01). Though unimpaired elderly adults did not benefit from stochastic stimulation, it cannot be deduced that individuals with more severe impairments of their sensory system do not profit from this treatment. While the errors in estimating wrist position are symmetric in flexion and extension in elderly adults, young adults are more accurate when estimating wrist flexion, an effect that has not been described before.

Developmental Differences in Cortical Activation During Action Observation, Action Execution and Interpersonal Synchrony: An fNIRS Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						57	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00057			MAR 3 2020	2020	Interpersonal synchrony (IPS) is an important everyday behavior influencing social cognitive development; however, few studies have investigated the developmental differences and underlying neural mechanisms of IPS. functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a novel neuroimaging tool that allows the study of cortical activation in the presence of natural movements. Using fNIRS, we compared cortical activation patterns between children and adults during action observation, execution, and IPS. Seventeen school-age children and 15 adults completed a reach to cleanup task while we obtained cortical activation data from bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and inferior parietal lobes (IPL). Children showed lower spatial and temporal accuracy during IPS compared to adults (i.e., spatial synchrony scores (Mean +/- SE) in children: 2.67 +/- 0.08 and adults: 2.85 +/- 0.06; temporal synchrony scores (Mean +/- SE) in children: 2.74 +/- 0.06 and adults: 2.88 +/- 0.05). For both groups, the STS regions were more activated during action observation, while the IFG and STS were more activated during action execution and IPS. The IPS condition involved more right-sided activation compared to action execution suggesting that IPS is a higher-order process involving more bilateral cortical activation. In addition, adults showed more left lateralization compared to the children during movement conditions (execution and IPS); which indicated greater inhibition of ipsilateral cortices in the adults compared to children. These findings provide a neuroimaging framework to study imitation and IPS impairments in special populations such as children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Interictal Epileptiform Discharges and the Quality of Human Intracranial Neurophysiology Data								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						44	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00044			MAR 3 2020	2020	Intracranial electroencephalography (IEEG) involves recording from electrodes placed directly onto the cortical surface or deep brain locations. It is performed on patients with medically refractory epilepsy, undergoing pre-surgical seizure localization. IEEG recordings, combined with advancements in computational capacity and analysis tools, have accelerated cognitive neuroscience. This Perspective describes a potential pitfall latent in many of these recordings by virtue of the subject population-namely interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), which can cause spurious results due to the contamination of normal neurophysiological signals by pathological waveforms related to epilepsy. We first discuss the nature of IED hazards, and why they deserve the attention of neurophysiology researchers. We then describe four general strategies used when handling IEDs (manual identification, automated identification, manual-automated hybrids, and ignoring by leaving them in the data), and discuss their pros, cons, and contextual factors. Finally, we describe current practices of human neurophysiology researchers worldwide based on a cross-sectional literature review and a voluntary survey. We put these results in the context of the listed strategies and make suggestions on improving awareness and clarity of reporting to enrich both data quality and communication in the field.

J	Peters, Jessica Lee; Bavin, Edith Laura; Crewther, Sheila Gillard								Eye Movements During RAN as an Operationalization of the RAN-Reading "Microcosm"								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						67	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00067			MAR 3 2020	2020	Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) is a strong predictor of reading aloud, though there is little agreement on what underpins RAN or how it relates to reading. Some theorize phonological skills, while others suggest that RAN reflects the "microcosm" of cognitive and attentional processes also required for reading, with more recent research using eye movements in an attempt to study this relationship. In the current study, we aimed to extend previous investigations to identify whether the temporal patterns of eye movements predict RAN and can, therefore, be established as a method to study the cognitive processes underlying RAN that could then be utilized to elucidate the relationship of RAN to reading. A Gazepoint eye tracker was used to record the eye movements of 93 learner readers aged 5-8 years (M age = 7.00) while performing a custom computerized alphabetic RAN task. Text reading accuracy, comprehension and rate; nonverbal intelligence; and phonological awareness abilities were also assessed. Regression analyses showed that, independently of phonological awareness, eye movements [Fixation Count (FC) and Fixation Duration (FD)] measured during RAN tasks were highly reflective of children's rapid naming performance (92.8%). Both mean FC and mean FD during RAN tasks also predicted text reading accuracy (36.3%), comprehension (31.6%), and rate (36.2%) scores, and in predicting these text reading skills there was a high level of shared variance with RAN performance. In a sub-sample of participants, longer average FDs and counts independently discriminated children with reading difficulties (n = 18; aged 7-9) from neurotypical children matched for age (n = 18), but not from younger neurotypical children matched for reading level (n = 18; aged 5-6). Together, these results suggest that the analysis of eye movements recorded during RAN allows for the operationalization of many of the spatially and temporally-bound cognitive and attentional processes that underpin the RAN, and a step towards elucidating its relationship to reading.

Repeated Application of Transcranial Diagnostic Ultrasound Towards the Visual Cortex Induced Illusory Visual Percepts in Healthy Participants								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						66	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00066			MAR 3 2020	2020	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the visual cortex can induce phosphenes as participants look at a visual target. So can non-diagnostic ultrasound (nDU), delivered in a transcranial fashion, while participants have closed their eyes during stimulation. Here, we sought to determine if DU, aimed at the visual cortex, could alter the perception of a visual target. We applied a randomized series of actual or sham DU, transcranially and towards the visual cortex of healthy participants while they stared at a visual target (a white crosshair on a light-blue background), with the ultrasound device placed where TMS elicited phosphenes. These participants observed percepts seven out of ten times, which consisted of extra or extensions of lines relative to the original crosshair, and additional colors, an average of 53.7 +/- 2.6% of the time over the course of the experiment. Seven out of ten different participants exposed to sham-only DU observed comparable percepts, but only an average of 36.3 +/- 1.9% of the time, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.00001). Moreover, on average, participants exposed to a combination of sham and actual ultrasound reported a net increase of 47.9 percentage points in the likelihood that they would report a percept by the end of the experiment. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a random combination of sham-only and actual DU, applied directly over the visual cortex of participants, increased the likelihood that they would observe visual effects, but not the type of effects, with that likelihood increasing over the course of the experiment. From this, we conclude that repeated exposures by DU may make the visual cortex more responsive to stimulation of their visual cortex by the visual target itself. Future studies should identify the biophysical mechanism(s) and neural pathways by which DU, in our hands and others, can generate its observed effects on brain function. These observations, consistent with other's observation of effects of DU stimulation of the human motor cortex and amygdala, as well as the FDA approved nature of DU, may lead to increased use of DU as a means of altering brain function.

Methods: This small randomized clinical trial examined the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of PACT versus CBT in improving couple support processes and smoking outcomes, focusing on effect sizes. Thirty-eight smokers and their nonsmoking partners were randomized to and completed either PACT or CBT. Both treatments included 8 weekly group sessions and nicotine replacement therapy. Results: Treatment credibility and satisfaction were high and comparable between conditions, though perceived helpfulness and treatment engagement were higher in PACT (ds = .48-.68). Compared to CBT, PACT showed no difference in effects on perceived partner support, small effects on observed social support behaviors (ds = .23 to .46), a medium effect on dyadic efficacy (d = .63), and a large effect on active listening (d = .85). Biochemically-verified smoking abstinence rates did not differ between conditions at 12-week follow-up (CBT: 27.3%, PACT: 37.5%). Conclusions: PACT may have stronger effects than standard CBT on treatment engagement and some couple support processes, but not abstinence. Program refinement and testing in larger samples are needed.

We investigated this issue in a gender categorization task involving healthy participants and a male split-brain patient: female or male natural voices were presented in one ear during the simultaneous presentation of white noise in the other ear (dichotic listening paradigm). Results revealed faster responses by the healthy participants for stimuli presented in the left than in the right ear, although no asymmetries emerged between the two ears in the accuracy of both the patient and the control group. Healthy participants were also more accurate at categorizing female than male voices, and an opposite-gender bias emerged - at least in females - showing faster responses in categorizing voices of the opposite gender. The results support a bilateral hemispheric involvement in voice gender categorization, without asymmetries in the patient, but with a faster categorization when voices are directly presented to the right hemisphere in the healthy sample. Moreover, when the two hemispheres directly interact with one another, a faster categorization of voices of the opposite gender emerges, and it can be an evolutionary grounded bias.

Conventional markers of SES may not fully capture how social position affects health in these groups. Objective: We examine: (1) the associations of two alternative indicators, subjective social status (SSS) and financial hardship, with problem drinking outcomes, heavy episodic drinking (HED) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), for Asian Americans and Latinos; and (2) moderation of these relationships by educational level and nativity status. Methods: Multiple logistic regression modeling was performed using nationally-representative Asian American (n = 2,095) and Latino samples (n = 2,554) from the National Latino and Asian American Study. Age, gender, nativity, individual-level SES (income and education), unfair treatment, racial discrimination, and social support were adjusted. Results: Financial hardship was independently associated with AUD in both Asians and Latinos. Lower SSS was associated with increased AUD risk among individuals with college degrees or with US nativity in both populations. The association between financial hardship and HED was positive for US-born Latinos and foreign-born Asians, and negative for foreign-born Latinos. Conclusions: SSS and financial hardship are indicators of SES that may have particular relevance for immigrant health, independently of education and income, with SSS particularly meaningful for AUD in the more conventionally advantaged subgroups. There may be underlying processes affecting Asian and other Latino subgroups with similar socioeconomic and nativity profiles and exposing them to common risk/protective factors of AUD.

Methods: One hundred doctors selected by convenience sampling from different departments of the hospital were assessed cross-sectionally. Physical parameters which were assessed included height, weight, blood pressure, and diabetes status. Other variables assessed included durations of duty hours and social media usage. Sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), respectively. Results: Mean age of the participants was 35.3 years with a SD of 6.21. In all, 42% were female. The overall prevalence of poor quality of sleep was 28.3%. Among the participants, junior and senior residents were the most affected; 45% of the junior residents were having a poor quality of sleep. Daytime sleepiness was significantly more common among the junior residents as compared with doctors of other designations (P =0.02). The mean duration of duty hours was highest for the junior residents. Male participants were more likely to be obese and to have systemic hypertension. No significant difference was found for social media usage among different designations or gender. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness are highly prevalent among the doctors, especially those who are lower in the hierarchy. Interventions for physical and psychological morbidity among the doctors and strict implementation of guidelines governing duty hours and call schedule of junior physicians are recommended.

J	Vidhukumar, K.; Hamza, Majida								Prevalence and Correlates of Burnout among Undergraduate Medical Students - A Cross-sectional Survey								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	2			122	127		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_192_19			MAR-APR 2020	2020	Background: Burnout among medical students is important for its prevalence, consequences, and modifiable risk factors. Although there are studies on the topic across the globe, Indian studies are few in number. A prevalence estimate of burnout and its determinants among Indian medical graduates will keep us informed about the emotional and motivational factors hindering their professional growth. Methods: From a total of 500 students spanning 5 professional years, data could be collected from 375 students. The study used a questionnaire primarily consisting of "personal burnout" domain of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), which is a validated instrument to assess the burnout at a cutoff score of 50. The questionnaire also included a set of potential personal correlates of burnout. In addition to summary statistics, both univariate and multivariate analyses were used for discerning the relationship of these correlates with burnout. Results: The prevalence of burnout among medical students in the college under study was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 43.4-53.7). The proportions of moderate, higher, and severe burnout were 44.8%, 3.2%, and 0.5% respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that female gender and perceived stress were associated with burnout. Choosing medicine by one's own choice and maintaining hobbies and interests were associated with less chance for burnout. Conclusion: Burnout is a prevalent phenomenon among medical students. There are modifiable risk factors for burnout and addressing them will help in training a medical student with high motivation and professionalism.

Women are more often blamed for mental illness, which can result in social isolation and stigma. Method: Case Study. Results: Psycho-social intervention aided in empowering women by giving them voices to speak as well as by utilizing their strengths and available community resources to develop a sense of self-efficacy, coping strategies, and support system. Conclusion: Women with chronic mental illness have unique needs and challenges. Mentally ill women face sexual coercion in childhood or adulthood. The factors related to help-seeking in the context of abuse were family reactions, social support, and stigma. Our findings highlight the need to conduct risk assessments and provide community-based and coordinated services during follow-up visits.

J	Gupta, Aarzoo; Sidana, Ajeet								Clinical Hypnotherapy in Grief Resolution - A Case Report								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	2			193	197		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_476_19			MAR-APR 2020	2020	Grief is one's reaction to any loss, and the coping mechanisms during grief either deplete or become maladaptive. One of the common ways to cope with grief is alcohol or substance intake. The course and resolution of grief vary depending upon many factors. Hypnotherapy has been useful and effective in addressing grief reactions as well as associated manifestation, such as sleep problems, depressive features, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It might be a good choice of treatment while dealing with patients having underlying issues or maladaptive coping mechanisms. This is a single case study design hypothesized to indicate maladaptive coping of increased alcohol consumption to deal with the death of a young son. The case had been treated as alcohol dependent syndrome with multiple hospitalizations without addressing underlying grief. The treatment approach was changed, and grief was addressed using hypnotherapy. Clinical hypnotherapy helped address grief and facilitated the index case to accept the loss. This resulted in minimizing hospitalizations, abstinence and improved day-to-day functioning along with the use of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the loss. Clinical hypnotherapy is an effective intervention to deal with underlying conflicts or issues that may not be addressed directly in a therapy setting.

Neurocognitive Profile in Indian Individuals Genetically at Risk of Schizophrenia								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	2			155	161		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_243_19			MAR-APR 2020	2020	Background: Cognitive deficits have been noted in patients of schizophrenia in remission, as well as in first-degree relatives. This study aims to evaluate the neurocognitive performance in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients of schizophrenia in comparison with healthy controls, as well as patients of schizophrenia in remission. Methods: It was a 1-year case-control study by purposive sampling. Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, first-degree relatives of patients of schizophrenia, and controls from nongenetic relatives of patients were recruited as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Samples were matched for age and educational status. The General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) screened them and they were checked for remission by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS) and then subjected to various instruments for assessment of neurocognition, standardized for the Indian population. To remove the effect of symptoms as confounding factors, PANSS score of < 3 for each individual item was set as the criterion for remission. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was screened in all participants to exclude mental retardation. Statistical analysis used was the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Fisher's least significant difference (LSD). Results: Significant neurocognitive impairments were detected in the patients and first-degree relatives when compared with the control subjects. The most common impairment in the patient group was in speed of processing, and among unaffected first-degree relatives, it was in the working memory. Conclusion: Indian individuals genetically at risk of schizophrenia showed significant neurocognitive impairments in all domains compared with controls.

J	Mohammed, Shabna; Tharayil, Harish; Gopakumar, Soumya; George, Christina								Pattern and Correlates of Depression among Medical Students: An 18-Month Follow-Up Study								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	2			116	121		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_28_19			MAR-APR 2020	2020	Background: Medical students are subjected to various challenges, which are possibly etiological in the onset and persistence of depression. There is inadequate research on the longitudinal pattern and correlates of the emotional health of medical students in India. We aim to delineate the longitudinal pattern of depression among medical students and the factors predictive of depression. Methods: An 18-month follow-up design with 350 students (2012 intake) from two medical colleges in Kerala, India, was employed. A semistructured questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 were administered 2, 8, and 18 months into the course. Results: Depression was present in 42.80%, 36.20%, and 42.50% of the students at the three assessments. Variables significantly associated with depression on univariate analysis were the course not being of the student's choice at the first assessment; having an unemployed parent (mother) at the second assessment; alcohol use and male gender at the third assessment. On multivariate analysis, male gender (OR = 1.95[1.11-3.41]) and the presence of depression at 2 months (OR = 2.30[1.31-4.05]) and 8 months (OR = 2.48[1.39-4.44]) were predictive of depression at 18 months. Conclusions: The high rates of depression and the pattern of high rates early in the course among the medical students contrasts with that reported from other countries. Early depression and male gender were predictive of depression later in the course. The implications of this are to be taken into consideration when undergraduate intervention programs are planned.

The study aimed to assess non-scholastic qualities and their association with social media usage among medical students. Methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study in a tertiary care medical institution in Puducherry, coastal south India. The non-scholastic qualities were assessed by standard questionnaire and categorised as low, moderate and high qualities. Social media usage was assessed by SONTUS (Social Networking Time Use Scale) and the participants were categorised as low, average, high, and extremely high users. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done. Results: Out of 270 medical students, 63% belonged to the moderate non-scholastic quality category. About 36% of the students had high non-scholastic quality. Most of the students were extremely high users of social media (60%). About 48% (47/98) of students with high non-scholastic qualities had extremely high social media usage, while 67% (115/172) of students with low and moderate non-scholastic qualities had extremely high social media usage, and both the associations were statistically significant (P = 0.003). Those with a high level of social media usage had 2.27 times (95% CI: 1.239-4.166) higher non-scholastic qualities compared to extremely high social media usage. Conclusions: The majority had moderate non-scholastic qualities and extremely high use of social media.

However, in situations in which a cause-effect relationship is scientifically plausible, reverse causation may also be possible. As an example, physical inactivity may predispose to dementia through cardiometabolic and other mechanisms. However, physical inactivity may also be a result of an ongoing dementia prodrome in which patients are physically slowed down during the years preceding the dementia diagnosis. This article examines reverse causation and how it was studied in a recent individual participant data meta-analysis of physical inactivity as a risk factor for dementia. This article also shows that other interpretations are possible when a finding suggests reverse causation.

In this background, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical profile of patients suffering from schizophrenia who were prescribed olanzapine LAI and to evaluate the usefulness and acceptability of olanzapine LAI among these patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, data of all the patients with schizophrenia receiving olanzapine pamoate, was extracted. Results: 40 patients (males-55%; mean [SD] age- 36.2 (12) years; mean duration of illness (SD) prior to depot-143.3 (115.9) months) were included in the study. Olanzapine LAI was invariably prescribed in patients with a past history of non-compliance. Data was available for a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 17 (10.8) months. The most frequently used dose of olanzapine LAI used was 300 mg every two weeks (55%). This was followed by 405 mg every four weeks in (32.5%). Mean Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity score prior to starting of olanzapine LAI was 5.8 (0.7), which reduced to 2.7 (1.1) at the time of last follow-up or the last use of olanzapine LAI, and this was a statistically significant improvement (paired t-test value = 16.41; P < 0.001). Only one (2.5%) patient experienced Post injection Delirium/Sedation Syndrome during the study period. Only one patient was hospitalized after starting depot olanzapine. Conclusion: Olanzapine LAI is mostly used in patients with a history of non-compliance. Olanzapine LAI is associated with a significant reduction in the severity of illness.

The relationship between modifiable intra-operative risk factors, such as intraoperative hypotension, and postoperative delirium is unclear. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the association between intra-operative hypotension and the development of a postoperative delirium in older patients with hip fracture. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of other pre- and intra-operative predisposing factors (anaesthetic approaches or specific anaesthetic drugs, surgery duration, timing of surgery, type of implants used as primary treatment, intra-operative blood loss) on developing postoperative delirium in this elderly population. This retrospective monocentric study included 100 consecutive hip fracture patients, aged 75 years and older, admitted to a dedicated orthogeriatric unit. All patients were screened for post-operative delirium using the confusion assessment method performed by a geriatrician. lntra-operative hypotension was defined as a decrease of more than 30% below the preoperative baseline for systolic blood pressure or a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 60 mmHg. Post-operative delirium (n = 37; 378%) and intra-operative hypotension (n = 80; 81.6%) are both common in old patients but we did not demonstrate a significant association regardless of the chosen definition. The following risk factors were significantly associated with postoperative delirium: surgical delay (OR 1.47[1.01-2.02]; p = 0.02), institutionalisation (OR 2.25[1.33-3.8]; p = 0.02) and postoperative acute kidney injury (OR 2.34[1.32-4.15]; p = 0.02). Postoperative delirium is common in old patients with hip fracture and is associated with postoperative complications, institutionalisation and surgical delay but not with intra-operative risk factors.

No prior studies have assessed prospectively risk and resiliency factors for chronic posttraumatic symptoms, as well as the potential interdependence between patients' and caregivers' symptoms over time. Objective: To analyze the impact of baseline resiliency factors on symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS) longitudinally in dyads of patients admitted to the Neuro-ICU and their primary family caregivers. Methods: We recruited dyads (M = 108) of patients admitted to the Neuro-ICU (total N = 102) and their family caregivers (total N = 103 ). Dyads completed self-report assessments of PTS and resiliency factors (mindfulness and coping) at baseline in the Neuro-ICU. PTS was measured again at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results: Clinically significant PTS symptoms were high at baseline in both patients (20%) and caregivers ( 16%) and remained high through 6 months (25% in patients; 14% in caregivers). Actor-partner interdependence modeling demonstrated that severity of PTS symptoms was predictive of PTS symptoms at subsequent time points (P < 0.001). High baseline mindfulness and coping predicted less severe PTS symptoms in patients and caregivers (P < 0.001) at all time points. Own degree of PTS symptoms at 3 months predicted worse PTS symptoms in one's partner at 6 months, for both patients and caregivers (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Findings highlight the need to prioritize assessment and treatment of PTS in Neuro-ICU patients and their informal caregivers through a dyadic approach.

How the only drugs available, in responder patients, to slow down the inexorable progression of Alzheimer's disease, can finally be defunded, after three Superior Health Authority reassessments (2007 2011, 2016) and therefore virtually removed from the therapeutic panel of physicians, while their beneficial effects, although modest on cognition, remained very actual on other symptoms such as apathy or hallucinations? How can this decision not to be understood as a signal of a disengagement from the state? How to maintain the trusting relationships between the patients, their families and caregivers, made of worry and patience?

Our objective was to develop an assessment tool, the MOT (music therapy orientation test) designed to evaluate the musical cognitive abilities of patients and to guide the music therapy plan. This article presents the guidelines and scoring terms for all items, as well as the normal range in older patients. The MOT was administered to 50 healthy elderly subjects (mean, 74.3 +/- 8.7 years) and 50 AD patients (mean, 82.8 +/- 8.0 years). The diagnosis was based on DSM-IV consensus criteria and all patients had a MMSE score <= 27/30 (mean, 16.16 +/- 6.91). The results showed an average success rate to the MOT that was lower in AD compared to cognitively healthy subjects (respectively 22.6 +/- 8.3/34 versus 32.4 +/- 1/34, p< 0.0001). The MOT score was positively correlated with the MMSE score (r=0.80, p< 0.001). With a threshold of 30/34, the MOT sensitivity was 74%, its specificity 96% and its positive predictive value 94.9%. Our results showed that a MOT score <30/34 is able to detect musical cognitive disabilities in AD patients. The MOT could be useful for music therapists to guide the music therapy plan.

We aimed to assess death obsession (DO) in elderly without dementia living in nursing homes, and to examine the association between DO and religiosity. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional survey involving 42 old subjects living in Manouba nursing home. The "Mini-Mental State Examination", the "Geriatric Depression Scale", the 'Activity of Daily Living", the "Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric", the "Death Obsession Scale", the "Brief religious coping scale" and the 'Arabic Religiosity Scale" were used to assess cognitive functions, depression, level of dependency, comorbidities, death obsession, religious coping and religiosity, respectively. Results: We found relatively high death obsession scores, with no gender differencies (mean scores = 33.1 +/- 18.1). The death obsession was significantly and positively associated with comorbidity scores (p = 0.04). No significant correlation was found between death obsession scores and religiosity and religious coping scores in the bivariate analysis. Similarly, multiple hierarchical regression found that religious variables (global religiosity and religious coping) did not significantly contribute to the variance of the death obsession. Conclusion: Older people living in nursing homes have specific psychosocial and spiritual needs, that health care providors should recognize, assess and care for, early and adequately.

This incredible faculty has a price because to speak is to make present what is absent. Thus everything that is present in speech is struck by an absence. This misunderstanding remains permanent among humans. That is why speech is not reduced to communication. However, the subjectivity of speech, allowed by the law of the father, seems to lead today to a crisis of humanization. The loss of the collective "we", which is now only the plural of the "I", makes the parameters at the origin of the demands of human language obsolete. Replacing the patriarchal pyramidal model with the horizontal model of neo-liberalism leads to lack of figuration and the exercise of responsibility in its name. We will analyze the new modalities of a language that transmits subjectivity and imagination but also political inscription.

The Chatbot as a Therapeutic Companion Tool for Depression in Breast Cancer Patients								PSYCHO-ONCOLOGIE				14	1-2			17	21		10.3166/pson-2020-0113			MAR-JUN 2020	2020	Aims: Chatbot is a software that uses machine learning and aims to simulate a conversation by text or voice message. The Vik chatbot was developed to improve the quality of life of patients with cancer or chronic disease. The objective of this pilot study is to measure the mood of breast cancer patients before and after being accompanied by the Vik chatbot. Procedure: Patients were recruited when they first used Vik. They were filtered according to inclusion criteria (age > 18 years, breast cancer patients, under treatment, non-opposition, internet knowledge). They were not to be followed for depressive disorders or undergoing psychotherapy. The PHQ-9 questionnaire was used to assess symptoms of depression. The patients with a score greater than 5 were only included in the study (JO). The PHQ-9 was then re-proposed at d+15 and d+30. Results: Users recruited (N= 74) were between 26 and 78 years of age. The average age was 50 years. The overall satisfaction rate was 94%. The average score obtained at PHQ-9 before using the chatbot (d0) was 9.73 (SD: 2.02). At the end of the 30 days of the experiment it was 5.00 (SD: 2.82). The change in mood over time has increased as participants chatted with the chatbot. Conclusion: This study provides promising evidence that a virtual assistant designed to support patients has the potential to offer an attractive method of follow-up and could be complementary to traditional methods of therapy.

Half the cases remain misdiagnosed. Objective: Assess the effectiveness of the Stanford Proxy Test for Delirium (S-PTD) in detecting delirium in an inpatient setting. Methods: This is a comparison study. Daily assessment with S-PTD, by the patient's nurse, and a neuropsychiatric assessment by a psychiatrist. Assessments were blinded. Inclusion criteria included 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria included patient's or surrogate's unwillingness to participate, inability to consent if a surrogate was not available, and inability to communicate in English or Spanish. A total of 309 patients were approached: 27 declined participation, 4 were excluded, and 278 subjects were followed up throughout their hospital stay. In the end, 78 were excluded for lack of neuropsychiatric assessment, S-PTD, or both. One was excluded for lack of demographic data. The sensitivity and specificity of the S-PTD in detecting delirium when compared with a neuropsychiatric assessment. Results: Participants were on average 60.8 years old and 54.3% were male. Patients who developed delirium were, on average, older (15.12 y, confidence interval: 8.94-21.32). A total of 199 patients were analyzed; 43 patients (21.6%) met criteria for delirium. S-PTD detected 67 days with delirium (16.5%) of 405 hospital days, while neuropsychiatric evaluation identified 83 (20.5%). S-PTD had a sensitivity of 80.72% and a specificity of 90.37%. Conclusion: S-PTD is an effective, comprehensive, and simple screening tool for delirium, which is robust despite fluctuating symptoms and lack of cooperation. The use of S-PTD may enhance early diagnosis of delirium.

Material and methods: We performed a prospective, single-center cohort study in patients leaving geriatric hospitalization between July 2016 and February 2017 with follow-up at 6 months. Patients 65 years of age and over, returning home, were included. The primary outcome measure was admission to an institution at 6 months. We realized a Cox model to explore the predictive character of the variables. Results: Thirty-three patients (18.4%), mean age 80.9 years (+/- 6.5), were not very fragile. At 6 months, 13.5% of the fragile or very fragile patients and 1.2% of the patients who were not very fragile had entered the institution (p = 0.169). Fragility status was statistically significantly associated with rehospitalization at 3 months (p = 0.026) and single or multiple drop at 6 months) month (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The SEGAm grid would predict the occurrence of derogatory events and improve return home.

By making it easier for the other to get the most out of it, Appreciative Inquiry feeds these essential assets and needs to the caregivers such as empathy, cooperation, and sharing. While hospitals are under pressure, Appreciative Inquiry is an innovative approach for appreciative questioning to bring out the factors and ingredients of success, too often left out, and especially the best of caregivers and patients. It allows making meaning into action by facilitating attention to what makes life and satisfaction for caregivers, the feeling of "good care" in particular, valuable not only in its aesthetic or ethical value but as a stimulant, protector of health at work and of high quality of care.

Impact on cancer care cost needs study to develop business case for psychosocial interventions. Objective: To evaluate the impact of preexisting psychiatric comorbidities on total cost of care during 6 months after cancer diagnosis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined patients diagnosed with cancer between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014, at one National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. Patients who received all cancer treatment at the study site (6598 of 11,035 patients) were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups, with or without psychiatric comorbidity, based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. Total costs of care during the first 6 months of treatment were based on standardized costs adjusted to 2014 dollars, determined by assigning Medicare reimbursement rates to professional billed services and applying appropriate cost-to-charge ratios. Quantile regression models with covariate adjustments were developed to assess the effect of psychiatric comorbidity across the distribution of costs. Results: Six hundred ninety-eight ( 10.6%) of 6598 eligible patients had at least one psychiatric comorbidity. These patients had more nonpsychiatric Elixhauser comorbidities (mean 4 vs. 3). Unadjusted total cancer care costs were higher for patients with psychiatric comorbidity (mean [standard deviation]: $51,798 [$74,549] vs. $32,186 [$45,240]; median [quartiles]: $23,871 [$10,705-$57,338] vs. $19,073 [$8120-$38,230] ). Quantile regression models demonstrated that psychiatric comorbidity had significant incremental effects at higher levels of cost: 75th percentile $8629 (95% confidence interval: $3617-13,642) and 90th percentile $42,586 (95% confidence interval: $25,843-59,330). Conclusions: Psychiatric comorbidities are associated with increased total cancer costs, especially in patients with very high cancer care costs, representing an opportunity to develop mitigation strategies.

J	Rabeyron, T.								Psy Wars: the Cognitive-Behavioral Tsunami in Great Britain								PSYCHO-ONCOLOGIE				14	1-2			66	76		10.3166/pson-2020-0120			MAR-JUN 2020	2020	This article provides a critical analysis of the evolution of psychotherapeutic care in Great Britain based on the reflections of Farad Dalal (2019) in a book entitled CBT: The Cognitive Behavioural Tsunami. After highlighting the ideological affinities between neo-liberalism and cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT), we look at how the latter have constructed a myth of their origins based on the false idea, disproved by empirical research, that they are supposedly more effective than other approaches. This ideological discourse is more broadly inscribed in the current context of the Psy Wars and the development of biological psychiatry that led to the contemporary evolutions of the Diagnostic and staticial manual of mental disorders, (DSM). We then describe the setting up of the Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) in Great Britain, a broad program intended to improve psychotherapeutic care on the basis of a liberalization of mental health. This program is based on the recommendations of the National institute for health and care excellence NICE, which has promoted the almost exclusive use of CBTs. After presenting how a patient is monitored thanks to IAPT, we highlight the excesses and failures of this system. We then offer a synthesis of the main forms of scientific corruption associated with CBTs, using two studies published in this field as examples. These analysis help to understand the gap between the empirical results of research in this field and the lack of effectiveness of CBTs. All of these elements, which stem from the ideological and scientific drifts of certain advocates of CBTs, appear to be essential to know and disseminate in order to avoid reproducing in France the same errors as Great Britain in the implementation of future public health policies concerning psychotherapies.

Ethics Consultations Related to Opioid Use Disorder								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	2			161	170		10.1016/j.psym.2019.10.003			MAR-APR 2020	2020	Background: The opioid epidemic has resulted in an increased number of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) hospitalized for serious medical conditions. The intersection between hospital ethics consultations and the opioid crisis has not received significant attention. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize ethics consult questions among inpatients with OUD at our institution, Massachusetts General Hospital. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of ethics consultations from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2017 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Results: Between 1993 and 2017, OUD played a central role in ethics consultations in 43 of 1061 (4.0%) cases. There was an increase in these requests beginning in 2009, rising from 1.4% to 6.8% of consults by 2017. Compared with other ethics cases, individuals with OUD were significantly younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be uninsured or underinsured (P < 0.001), and more likely to have a comorbid mental health diagnosis (P = 0.001). The most common reason for consultation involved continuation of life-sustaining treatment in the setting of overdose with neurological injury or severe infection. Additional reasons included discharge planning, challenges with pain management and behavior, and the appropriateness of surgical intervention, such as repeat valve replacement or organ transplant. Health care professionals struggled with their ethical obligations to patients with OUD, including when to treat pain with narcotics and how to provide longitudinal care for patients with limited resources outside of the hospital. Conclusion: The growing opioid epidemic corresponds with a rise in ethics consultations for patients with OUD. Similar factors associated with OUD itself including comorbid mental health diagnoses and concerns about relapse, contributed to the ethical complexities of these consults.

Development and Implementation of a Suicide Prevention Checklist to Create a Safe Environment								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	2			154	160					MAR-APR 2020	2020	Background: An increasing number of patients are admitted to general hospitals for injuries sustained in suicide attempts and for assessment of their ongoing risk for suicide. However, clinical staff may lack knowledge and expertise in the provision of a safe environment for potentially suicidal patients. Objective: In an effort to follow the Joint Commission's recommendations on the care of suicidal patients, a Suicide Prevention Interdisciplinary Task Force was created. The task force sought to design and implement a suicide checklist that would facilitate creation of a safe environment for potentially suicidal inpatients on nonpsychiatric units in a general hospital. Methods: We describe the development and implementation of a Care of the Suicide and Self-Injury Patient Checklist and report on data derived from incident reports related to self-harm/suicide attempts over a 4-year period. We also report results of a Research Electronic Data Capture survey of nurses' feedback on the checklist. Results: After implementation of the Care of the Suicide and Self-Injury Patient Checklist, a total of 47 incidents of patient self-injury were reported over 4 years on nonpsychiatric inpatient units at a large general hospital; only three sustained permanent or serious harm. The Research Electronic Data Capture survey revealed that 88% of responding nurses believed that the Care of the Suicide and Self-Injury Patient Checklist guided creation of a safe environment and 90% believed that it supported consistent practice. Conclusions: The Care of the Suicide and Self-Injury Patient Checklist contributed to the creation of a safe environment while caring for potentially suicidal patients on nonpsychiatric inpatient units and guided clinicians on the management of potentially self-injurious individuals.

The effects of age on episodic memory underlie both the decline in real memories and the increase in false memories. But, what is the richness and what is the feeling of reality of false memories in the elderly? This mini-review on false memory in young and older adults presents the results from the literature using one of the most used paradigms in the laboratory to study the false memories - the DeeseRoediger-McDermott paradigm. This paradigm generally consists in the presentation of semantically associated items-lists (words or images) related to a non-presented critical lure (e.g., bed, rest, awake ..., the critical lure is sleep). During free recall or recognition tests, the participants regularly produce false memories (intrusions or false recognitions of the critical lures), increasingly with aging. We specifically ask the question of the richness of the false memory trace in young and older adults in terms of contextual associations (What-Where-When-Details binding) and phenomenological characteristics (remembering, knowing, guessing). We propose to examine this issue using a naturalistic episodic memory task via navigation in a virtual environment enriched with series of associated elements (e.g., vegetables stand) linked to non-presented critical lures (e.g., carrots). Based on preliminary results, we propose an integrative model of memory trace which can explain the differences observed between young and old people on the richness of their false memories.

Falling is a symptom present in various chronic diseases, which leads to loss of autonomy, fear of recidivism and frequent admissions into institutions. Study objective was to evaluate at 3 and 6 months the impact of TPE on fall recurrence, perceived quality of life and fear of falling, in elderly over 75 living at home. Methods: We performed a prospective study comparing two groups: a group participating in day hospital (group "TPE") and a control group (group "Hospitalized") of elderly patient not receiving TPE recruited in short geriatric stays following a fall at home. Results: 28 patients in the "TPE" group and 20 patients in the "Hospitalized" group were included. The "TPE" group reported significantly better perceived quality of life at 3 months and 6 months. At 6 months, fear of falling was twice as high in the "Hospitalized" group than in the "TPE" group. Conclusions: The group of subjects who was able to benefit from therapeutic education at home had an improved quality of life at 3 and 6 months and a decrease in the fear of falling at 6 months.

Definitions and theoretical frameworks were produced and operational initiatives were deployed on the territories. The health journey is one of the themes constituting the framework of France Assos Sante's strategic orientations for the next four years. One of the claims relates to the need to go beyond the single course of care, to take into account the determinants of health, the breaking points in the courses and to value experiential knowledge. Its work is divided into a plea which requires users or user associations to be involved in any reflection or project around the creation of routes in a territory, and that the implementation of participatory approaches and empowerment processes. Pilot projects have been deployed in the territories, by some of its territorial delegations, and by headquarters. The associative initiatives demonstrate that user associations are very active in countering breaks in the trajectories and that they therefore participate in the efficiency of the health system.

The Psychosocial Assessment of Transplant Candidates: Inter-Rater Reliability and Predictive Value of the Italian Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT)								PSYCHOSOMATICS				61	2			127	134					MAR-APR 2020	2020	Background: The Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT) is a comprehensive instrument developed to accurately assess the main pretransplant psychosocial risk factors that may impact transplant outcomes. Objective: As neither established assessment procedures nor standardized tools designed to perform pretransplant psychosocial evaluation are currently available in Italy, the present study was designed to develop and preliminarily validate the Italian version of the SIPA T. Methods: First, our team developed the Italian version of the SIPAT, following standard forward-back translation procedures. Then, the Italian version of the SIPAT was retrospectively and blindly applied to 118 randomly selected transplant cases (40 heart, 40 lung, and 38 liver) by 2 independent examiners. Information about the patients' final transplant listing recommendation (i.e., listing vs. deferral) was independently collected from the respective transplant teams. Results: The interrater reliability of the Italian version of the SIPAT scores was substantial (Cohen's kappa = 0.77; P < 0.001). Moreover, the predictive value of the SIPAT ratings on the final transplant listing recommendation (i.e., listing vs. deferral) for each examiner was significant (both P < 0.05). Conclusion: Current findings suggest that SIPAT is a promising and reliable instrument in its Italian version. Given these excellent psychometric characteristics, the use of the SIPAT as part of the pretransplant psychosocial evaluation in Italian medical settings is highly encouraged.

In older adults, dementia represents the majority of hippocampal diseases, but other specific pathologies must be known in the differential diagnosis. Many hippocampal abnormalities are represented by a loss of substance (atrophy). However, most acute or recent hippocampal damage is detected by MRI signal abnormalities. The aim of this article is to offer a pictorial review of the normal and pathological hippocampal aspects of older adults, during degenerative, infectious, vascular, inflammatory, tumoral, toxic and metabolic disorders.

Objective: This study aims to describe and evaluate the knowledge about frailty, its screening tests and management in a population of general practice interns. Method: A prospective, descriptive and mono-centric study using an online survey was conducted. The 2018's promotion of general practice interns in Rouen's University participated. Evaluation of the general knowledge (e.g diagnostic criteria) and specific knowledge (e.g ranking different conditions such as: undernourishment leading to asthenia) and management algorithm (e.g to address the patient for geriatric evaluation) Results: 90 questionnaires were analyzed. Ten interns (11%) stated to know at least one screening test or to know a set of 4 major frailty criteria. Thirty four interns knew at least 4 frailty criteria (major or minor) and 46 interns had partial knowledge. Fried's phenotype was the most known. Seventy-five interns (83%) stated to know the frailty syndrome. However, 88% of the interns had little knowledge about its pathophysiology. Concerning frailty management, 78% (70 interns) stated to know how to screen frailty and prescribe first line treatments. Thirty-one among them knew how to reassess initial treatment if failure. In 59 interns (65%), identifying frailty would have led to a geriatric consultation. Seventy-nine interns (87%) were favorable to go through further training on frailty. Conclusion: These general practice interns were able to identify frailty criterion but, in contrast, global understanding of the syndrome was missing. Further training about this topic seems to be necessary		[Piedallu, Jean-Baptiste; Schuers, Mathieu] CHU Rouen, Dept Med Gen, Rouen, France; [Lorenzo-Villalba, Noel; Zulfiqar, Abrar-Ahmad] CHRU Strasbourg, Hop Civil, Dept Med Interne, Strasbourg, France; [Chassagne, Philippe] CHU Rouen, Med Interne & Geriatr, Rouen, France; [Zulfiqar, Abrar-Ahmad] CHRU Strasbourg, Hop Civil, Dept Med Interne, Strasbourg, France								0							Psychiatry; Psychology	WOS:000520027200007

Procedure: As part of an ongoing doctoral research, semi-guiding interviews are offered prior to, 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. These interviews are combined with supervisions of urological consultations. Results: The use of robotic assistance is, for a lot of patients, considered as an insignificant action, just a tool extending the surgeon's movement and improving his comfort. Nevertheless, for some patients, robotic assistance generates anxiety, particularly because of robophobia and robot-related fantasies. In addition, some patients associate robotic assistance to the seriousness of the illness and the ability to access the best available treatment. Conclusion: Considering the increased use of robotic-assistance in radical prostatectomy, it is important to analyze the impact of this technique not only on the patient's body but also on the related fantasies and anxieties, as well as its impacts on the doctor-patient relationship.

Effectiveness of Prompt Mental Health Care, the Norwegian Version of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies: A Randomized Controlled Trial								PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS				89	2			90	105		10.1159/000504453			MAR 2020	2020	Background: The innovative treatment model Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and its Norwegian adaptation, Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC), have been evaluated by cohort studies only. Albeit yielding promising results, the extent to which these are attributable to the treatment thus remains unsettled. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of the PMHC treatment compared to treatment as usual (TAU) at 6-month follow-up. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with parallel assignment was performed in two PMHC sites (Sandnes and Kristiansand) and enrolled clients between November 9, 2015 and August 31, 2017. Participants were 681 adults (aged >= 18 years) considered for admission to PMHC due to anxiety and/or mild to moderate depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]/Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7] scores above cutoff). These were randomly assigned (70:30 ratio; n = 463 to PMHC, n = 218 to TAU) with simple randomization within each site with no further constraints. The main outcomes were recovery rates and changes in symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) between baseline and follow-up. Primary outcome data were available for 73/67% in PMHC/TAU. Sensitivity analyses based on observed patterns of missingness were also conducted. Secondary outcomes were work participation, functional status, health-related quality of life, and mental well-being. Results: A reliable recovery rate of 58.5% was observed in the PMHC group and of 31.9% in the TAU group, equaling a between-group effect size of 0.61 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.85, p < 0.001). The differences in degree of improvement between PMHC and TAU yielded an effect size of -0.88 (95% CI -1.23 to -0.43, p < 0.001) for PHQ-9 and -0.60 (95% CI -0.90 to -0.30, p < 0.001) for GAD-7 in favor of PMHC. All sensitivity analyses pointed in the same direction, with small variations in point estimates. Findings were slightly more robust for depressive than anxiety symptoms. PMHC was also more effective than TAU in improving all secondary outcomes, except for work participation (z = 0.415, p = 0.69). Conclusions: The PMHC treatment was substantially more effective than TAU in alleviating the burden of anxiety and depression. This adaptation of IAPT is considered a viable supplement to existing health services to increase access to effective treatment for adults who suffer from anxiety and mild to moderate depression. A potential effect on work participation needs further examination.

Often undetected, it may also be insufficiently treated when diagnosed. Few therapeutic trials have specifically addressed depression in the elderly and guidelines for screening and management are most often based on expert opinion or extrapolation of data from younger patients. The objective of this article is to provide a synthesis of current knowledge on depression in the elderly and to recall, on the one hand, the importance of a targeted screening, and, on the other hand, the importance of a personalized management resulting from a global and multidisciplinary assessment.

Method: Participants (n = 311) were high school seniors randomized by class period to the eCHECKUP TO GO intervention or assessment-only control group. Participants completed online surveys at baseline and 30-day follow-up (91.0%; n = 283). Results: Students in the intervention group reported a significant reduction in normative perceptions of peer drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, and alcohol use relative to those in the control group. Intervention effects for perceptions of frequency of peer drunkenness and frequency of alcohol use were moderated by sex, with results favoring females. In contrast, we did not find evidence for sex as a moderator of intervention effects for normative perceptions of peer drinking frequency, sex-specific perceptions of peer heavy episodic drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, or peak drinking quantity. Further, we did not find significant intervention or moderator effects for protective behavioral strategies. Conclusions: Results of this study extend the literature by demonstrating the efficacy of the eCHECKUP TO GO for both males and females on reducing cognitive risk factors and alcohol use, although results were significant for a broader range of variables for females. Results also indicate that program content regarding normative feedback and protective behavioral strategies may need modification to be more effective for this age group.

J	Li, Zhaoyi; Hu, Zhiguo; Liu, Hongyan								Influence of sexual dimorphism on the attractiveness evaluation of one's own face								VISION RESEARCH				168				1	8		10.1016/j.visres.2020.01.005			MAR 2020	2020	The present study aimed to explore the influence of sexual dimorphism on the evaluation of the attractiveness of one's own face. In the experiment, a masculinized and a feminized version of the self-faces of the participants were obtained by transferring the original faces toward the average male or female face. The participants were required to rate the attractiveness of three types (original, masculine, feminine) of their own faces and the other participants' faces in same-sex and opposite-sex contexts. The results revealed that the participants rated their own faces as more attractive than other participants rated them regardless of the sexually dimorphic type (original, masculine, feminine) or the evaluation context, More importantly, the male and female participants showed different preferences for the three types of self-faces. Specifically, in the same-sex context, the female participants rated their own original faces as significantly more attractive than the masculine and feminine faces, and the male participants rated their own masculine faces as significantly more attractive than the feminine faces; while in the opposite-sex context, no significant difference among the attractiveness scores of the three types of self-faces was found in both the male and female participants. The present study provides empirical evidence of the influence of sexual dimorphism on the evaluation of the attractiveness of self-faces.

Simultaneous Alcohol and Marijuana Use: A Brief Measure of Motives								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	2			203	211					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: Increasing numbers of substance users report simultaneous alcohol and marijuana (SAM) use such that their effects overlap. More research is needed to understand what motivates this behavior, especially to inform interventions that address SAM use. A 26-item measure of SAM motives was designed and tested in previous research. The purpose of the current study was to validate that measure and create a briefer version of it. Method: Using two waves of data from a multi-site sample of college students (n = 1,014), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to develop a brief 11-item SAM Motives Measure (B-SMM). Negative binomial regression analyses were conducted to assess the reliability and validity of both the original and brief measures. Results: The brief measure contains four subscales (conformity, positive effects, calm/coping, and social) that match the empirically supported motivational model of substance use. Internal consistency of the subscales ranged from .77 to .87. Most subscales significantly predicted frequency and consequences of SAM use both concurrently and prospectively. Conclusions: The psychometrically sound measure developed in this study facilitates the examination of SAM motives in clinical settings with time-constrained patient contact and can be valuable for research involving frequent and repeated measures of substance use behaviors.

Method: A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine changes in the intervention versus comparison site for three outcomes: unprompted and prompted recall of the cancer warning, and knowledge that alcohol can cause cancer. The intervention site applied cancer warning labels to alcohol containers in its liquor store for 1 month, and the two liquor stores in the comparison site did not apply cancer labels. In total, 2,049 unique cohort participants (1,056 male) were recruited at liquor stores in the intervention and comparison sites to participate in surveys 4 months before labels were applied and 2 and 6 months after the cancer label was halted because of alcohol industry interference. Generalized estimating equations tested differences in outcomes between sites over time adjusting for socio-demographics and other covariates. Results: Two months after the cancer label, unprompted (+24.2% vs. +0.6%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 32.7, 95% CI [5.4, 197.7]) and prompted (+35.7% vs. +4.1%; AOR = 6.2, 95% CI [3.6, 10.9]) recall increased to a greater extent in the intervention versus comparison site. There was a 10% greater increase in knowledge (+12.1% vs. +11.6%; AOR = 1.1, 95% CI [0.7, 1.5]) 2 months after the cancer label in the intervention versus comparison site. Similar results were found 6 months after the cancer label for all three outcomes. Conclusions: In a real-world setting, cancer warning labels get noticed and increase knowledge that alcohol can cause cancer. Additional cancer label intervention studies are required that are not compromised by industry interference.

Assessments of parental involvement and monitoring by youth and parents may capture an additional source of risk: differences in perceptions of these parenting behaviors. This study tested for unique contributions of youth-reported parental involvement and monitoring and youth-parent discrepancies in reporting to first cigarette use in girls. Method: Data were drawn from interviews at ages 8-17 with 1,869 girls (57.3% Black, 42.7% White) and their primary caregivers (94% mothers) in the Pittsburgh Girls Study. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to predict first cigarette use as a function of girls' reports of parental involvement and monitoring, magnitude and direction of youth-parent reporting discrepancies, and the interaction between them, adjusting for neighborhood, socioeconomic, and individual level factors. Results: High magnitude of discrepancy in parental involvement reports (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.26]) and lower perceived parental involvement by girls (HR = 1.14, CI [1.03, 1.27]) were associated with an elevated risk for first cigarette use. Girls' reports of low parental monitoring also predicted first cigarette use (HR = 1.14, CI [1.06, 1.21]). Conclusions: Girls whose parents have limited awareness of their whereabouts and friends (i.e., low monitoring) are at an elevated risk for trying cigarettes, but parent-daughter differences in perceived awareness do not affect risk. By contrast, girls who perceive a lower degree of parental involvement than their parents do are at increased risk. Monitoring is one component of parenting that may reduce smoking risk; shared perspectives on the parent's level of involvement are similarly important.

The purpose of this study was to examine the framing of news coverage of alcohol warning label (AWL) initiatives that included a cancer message on alcohol containers in two different countries. Policy contexts and industry perspectives were also evaluated. Method: We identified and systematically reviewed news articles published between 2017-2019 covering an AWL academic study in Yukon, Canada, and labeling provisions in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in Ireland. Both included a cancer message. News stories were coded for media type and topic slant; inclusion of alcohol industry perspectives was examined using content analysis. Results: Overall, 68.4% of media articles covering the Yukon Study (n = 38) and 18.9% covering the Ireland Bill (n = 37) were supportive of AWLs with a cancer message. The majority of articles in both sites presented alcohol industry perspectives (Yukon, 65.8%; Ireland, 86.5%), and industry arguments opposing AWLs were similar across both contexts. In articles with statements from industry representatives, the label message was frequently disputed by distorting or denying the evidence that alcohol causes cancer (n = 33/43). Conclusions: News coverage of AWLs with a cancer message was more supportive in Canada than Ireland, where alcohol industry perspectives were consistently foregrounded. Industry arguments opposing the cancer label bore similarities across contexts, often distorting or denying the evidence. Increasing awareness of industry messaging strategies may generate more critical coverage of industry lobbying activities and increase public support for alcohol policies.

JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	2			144	151					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with high social and health care costs. We compare the direct social and health care costs of patients with AUDs, according to four service use profiles: (a) AUD treatment, (b) mental health (MH) treatment, (c) AUD + MH treatment, (d) no treatment. A separate analysis of the costliest 10% is included. Furthermore, the association between the service user profile and the risk of death is examined. Method: Direct unit service costs were retrieved from the electronic health record system and supplemented with patient grouping-based costs for primary and secondary care services, to examine the yearly mean cost per patient in the AUD cohort (N = 5,136; 71.1% male). We used data collected in the North Karelia region of Finland between 2014 and 2018. Results: Total costs of care for the cohort during the 5-year follow-up were 126 million Euros, and the percentage of the costliest 10% (n = 521) was 51.7% (65 million Euros). Total costs were 12,778 Euros lower if the person received AUD treatment only, compared with those not in treatment. For those receiving MH treatment only, the total costs were 1,819 Euros higher, and costs were 1,523 Euros higher for those receiving AUD + MH treatment. Receiving any treatment was associated with a diminished risk of death (AUD: odds ratio [OR] = 0.56; MH: OR = 0.63; AUD + MH: OR = 0.41). Conclusions: Receiving only AUD treatment was associated with the lowest cost of care. Our results support the early identification of AUDs and provision of treatment in specialized addiction services to lower the costs of care and improve care outcomes.

J	Goodman, Samantha; Hammond, David								Does Unit-Dose Packaging Influence Understanding of Serving Size Information for Cannabis Edibles?								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	2			173	179					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: Edible cannabis products have increased in popularity, particularly in jurisdictions that have legalized nonmedical cannabis. Rates of adverse events from cannabis edibles have also increased, in part because of difficulties identifying and titrating tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels. The current study tested whether packaging cannabis in separate units enhances consumer understanding of serving sizes. Method: An experimental task was conducted as part of the 2018 International Cannabis Policy Study online survey. Participants were recruited from the Nielsen Global Insights Consumer Panel. A total of 26,894 participants (61.5% female) ages 16-65 years from Canada and the United States were randomly assigned to view a cannabis brownie packaged according to one of three conditions: (a) multiserving edible ("control condition"), (b) single-serving edible, and (c) single-serving edible packaged separately ("unit-dose packaging"). Participants were asked to identify a standard serving based on information on the product label. Logistic regression was used to test the influence of packaging condition on the likelihood of a correct response, adjusting for key covariates. Results: Compared with the multiserving edible control (50.6%), participants were significantly more likely to correctly identify the serving size in the single-serving edible condition (55.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22, CI [1.15, 1.29], p <.001) and the unit-dose packaging condition (54.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.17, CI [1.10, 1.24], p <.001). Conclusions: Packaging in which each product unit contained one dose of THC enhanced consumers' ability to identify how much of a product constitutes a standard serving or dose. Packaging products as individual doses eliminates the need for mental math and could reduce the risk of accidental overconsumption of cannabis.

However, previous research has often neglected the temporal dynamic of automatic processes in addiction and focused on immediate approach biases instead of delayed approach biases. Method: Thirty-one male smokers and 30 healthy males were tested by an adapted Approach-Avoidance Task. In this task, immediate as well as delayed approach biases were assessed by manipulating cue-response time intervals. Results: When exposed to smoking cues, smokers have significantly stronger approach bias than nonsmokers at a delay of 0 ms, 600 ms, and 900 ms rather than at 300 ms. Conclusions: This study found that smokers have a strong, immediate approach bias toward smoking-related cues. But this approach bias will keep changing with increased cognitive processing time. Temporal dynamics may be an important feature of the addiction-related approach bias.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether these suppressive interactions were narrowband and tuned for spatial frequency or broadband and independent of spatial frequency. We measured the contrast sensitivity and masking functions of fifteen amblyopic subjects and seventeen control subjects using the quick Contrast Sensitivity Function (qCSF) approach (Lesmes, Lu, Baek, & Albright, 2010). We first measured the monocular sensitivity functions of each participant and thereafter corrected for it. We then measured masking sensitivity functions for low, mid and high spatial frequency masks, normalized to their visibility. In the control group, we observed that the strength of dichoptic masking is equivalent between the two eyes. It is also tuned such that masking by low spatial frequencies in one eye mainly affects low spatial frequencies in the other eye and masking by high spatial frequencies mainly affects high spatial frequencies. In amblyopes, although the interocular masking is also tuned for spatial frequency, it is not equivalent between the two eyes: the masking effect from the amblyopic to fixing eye is weaker than the other way around. The asymmetry observed in the strength of masking between the two eyes in amblyopia is tuned for spatial frequency. It is not the consequence of the contrast sensitivity deficit of the amblyopic eye nor is it the consequence of abnormally strong masking from the fixing eye. Rather it is due to an abnormally weak masking strength by the amblyopic eye per se.

Method: Heavy drinking college students (n = 96; 52% women) completed daily reports across a 28-day period to assess alcohol use and positive and negative consequences of drinking. They returned to the lab at the end of this period to complete a TLFB assessing behavior over those same 28 days. First, t tests were used to compare variables aggregated across the full 28 days at the between-person level. Next, hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine within-person differences between methods for each variable in weekly and daily increments. Results: Many alcohol use and consequence variables were significantly different when derived from self-reports during TLFB versus daily reports. In contrast to prior work, we found that higher estimates of drinking were reported retrospectively on the TLFB than on the daily reports. In addition, discrepancies were greater on some variables for heavier drinkers and when more time had elapsed between the end of the daily reporting period and TLFB collection. Conclusions: Recall of drinking behavior during TLFB and daily reports may differ in systematic ways, with discrepancies varying based on participant and methodological characteristics.

The Relationship Between Exposure to Alcohol Marketing and Underage Drinking Is Causal								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS								113	124					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: This article summarizes the findings of narrative and systematic literature reviews focused on the relationship between exposure to alcohol marketing and youth drinking. viewed in context of criteria for causality. We also consider the implications of this proposition for alcohol policy and public health. Method: Our descriptive synthesis of findings is from 11 narrative and systematic reviews using the nine Bradford Hill causality criteria: (a) strength of association, (b) consistency, (c) specificity of association, (d) temporality, (e) biological gradient, (f) biological plausibility, (g) coherence, (h) experimental evidence, and (i) analogy. Results: Evidence of causality for all nine of the Bradford Hill criteria was found across the review articles commissioned for this supplement and in other previously published reviews. In some reviews. multiple Bradford Hill criteria were met. The reviews document that a substantial amount of empirical research has been conducted in a variety of countries using different but complementary research designs. Conclusions: The research literature available today is consistent with the judgment that the association between alcohol marketing and drinking among young persons is causal.

Group Versus Standard Behavioral Couples' Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder Patients: Cost-Effectiveness								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	2			152	163					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of two treatments for 101 alcohol use disorder patients and their intimate partners-group behavioral couples' therapy plus individual-based treatment (G-BCT), or standard behavioral couples' therapy plus individual-based treatment (S-BCT). Method: We estimated the per-patient cost of each intervention using a microcosting approach that allowed us to estimate costs of specific components in each intervention as well as the overall total costs. Using simple means analysis and multiple regression models, we estimated the incremental effectiveness of G-BCT relative to S-BCT. Immediately after treatment and 12 months after treatment, we computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for percentage days abstinent, adverse consequences of alcohol and drugs, and overall relationship functioning. Results: The average per-patient cost of delivering G-BCT was $674, significantly less than the cost of S-BCT ($831). However, 12 months after treatment, S-BCT participants performed better on all outcomes compared with those in G-BCT, and the calculated ICER moving from G-BCT to S-BCT ranged from $10 to $12 across these outcomes. The current findings indicated that, except at very low willingness-to-pay values, S-BCT is a cost-effective option relative to G-BCT when considering 12-month posttreatment outcomes. Conclusions: As expected, G-BCT was delivered at a lower cost per patient than S-BCT; however, S-BCT performed better over time on the clinical outcomes studied. These economic findings indicate that alcohol use disorder treatment providers should seriously consider S-BCT over G-BCT when deciding what format to use in behavioral couples' therapy.

Transient pupillary light reflex in CEP290- or NPHP5-associated Leber congenital amaurosis: Latency as a potential outcome measure of cone function								VISION RESEARCH				168				53	63		10.1016/j.visres.2020.01.006			MAR 2020	2020	Mutations in photoreceptor cilium genes CEP290 and NPHP5 cause a form of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) which typically lacks rods but retains central cones. The current study evaluated the transient pupillary light reflex (TPLR) as an objective outcome measure to assess efficacy of ongoing and future therapies. Eleven eyes of six patients selected for retained cone function were tested with TPLR using full-field stimuli in the dark-adapted state. Stimuli were red or blue with 1 s duration and spanned a 6-log unit dynamic range. TPLR response amplitude was quantified at fixed times of 0.9 and 2 s after stimulus onset and TPLR latency was defined as the time to reach 0.3 mm constriction. Full-field stimulus testing (FST) and static perimetry were used to correlate subjective perception with objective TPLR parameters. TPLR and FST thresholds with both red and blue stimuli were abnormally elevated in patients to near -1.25 log phot-cdm(-2) consistent with the lack of rods. TPLR latencies were delayed on average but showed some differences among patients. Remnant extrafoveal vision was correlated with faster TPLR latencies. Our results support the use of a short TPLR protocol with full-field red stimuli of 0.7 log phot-cd.m(-2) or brighter as an objective and convenient outcome measure of cone function in CEP290- and NPHP5-LCA. The latency parameter of the TPLR would be expected to show a detectable change when an intervention modifies cone sensitivity in the extrafoveal region.

Hookah Susceptibility and Transitions Over the First Year of College								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	2			195	202					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: There has been a growth in popularity of hookah (or waterpipes) among American college students, despite the health risks. This study investigated factors that predict hookah susceptibility and whether hookah susceptibility predicts hookah initiation and continued use. Method: The study established a cohort of 529 incoming college freshmen (51.6% female) who completed an online survey approximately 1 week before their arrival to a large U.S. university. Students were sent four follow-up surveys throughout the 2016-2017 academic year; 90.5% completed at least one follow-up survey. Results: A total of 13.2% of the sample had used hookah at baseline and 9.9% initiated hookah use over the course of their freshman year. Among the nonusers who had no hookah susceptibility at baseline, 30.0% came to indicate some susceptibility. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that the personality construct conscientiousness was protective against becoming susceptible, whereas coming from a rural part of the state was a risk factor. Susceptibility predicted both continued use among the baseline ever-users and initiation among the baseline never-users. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of susceptibility in the trajectory of hookah use among U.S. college students.

We assessed consumers' baseline knowledge of alcohol-related cancer risk, standard drinks, and low-risk drinking guidelines as well as levels of support for AWLs. We further assessed associations with sociodemographic factors. Method: Forming part of a larger study testing new evidence-informed AWLs in a northern Canadian territory compared with a neighboring territory, baseline surveys were completed among liquor store patrons systematically selected in both sites. Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess outcomes. Results: In total, 836 liquor store patrons (47.8% female) completed baseline surveys across both sites. Overall, there was low knowledge of alcohol-related cancer risk (24.5%), limited ability to calculate a standard drink (29.5%), and low knowledge of daily (49.5%) and weekly (48.2%) low-risk drinking guideline limits. There was moderate support for AWLs with a health warning (55.9%) and standard drink information (51.4%), and lower support for low-risk drinking guideline labels (38.7%). No sociodemographic characteristics were associated with cancer knowledge. Identifying as female and having adequate health literacy were associated with support for all three AWLs; high alcohol use was associated with not supporting standard drink (adjusted odds ratio = 0.60, 95% CI [0.40, 0.88]) and low-risk drinking guideline (adjusted odds ratio = 0.57, 95% CI [0.38, 0.87]) labels. Conclusions: Few consumers in this study had key alcohol-related health knowledge; however, there was moderate support for AWLs as a tool to raise awareness. Implementation of information-based interventions such as evidence-informed AWLs with health messages including alcohol-related cancer risk, standard drink information, and national drinking guidelines is warranted.

A well-known abnormality is internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). This study aims to describe saccadic abnormalities beyond INO and investigate their clinical relevance. A validated standardized infrared oculography protocol, DEMoNS, was used for quantifying saccadic eye movements in three different tasks in MS patients and healthy controls. The relationship between the saccadic parameters and disease characteristics was investigated. Furthermore, the association between saccadic parameters and visual functioning was analysed using logistic regression models, adjusted for possible confounders. This cross-sectional study included 218 subjects with MS and 58 healthy controls. The latency of all saccades was longer in MS patients than in healthy controls. This saccadic delay was larger in subjects with a longer disease duration and more disabled subjects. Furthermore, it was significantly related to presence of a lower vision-related quality of life. This study provided a comprehensive overview of performance of MS patients in different saccadic tasks, compared to healthy controls. Saccadic delay in MS patients was present in all saccadic tasks and was related to advancing disease and visual functioning in daily life.		[Bijvank, J. A. Nij; Petzold, A.; Tan, H. S.; van Rijn, L.

J	Jernigan, David; Ross, Craig S.								The Alcohol Marketing Landscape: Alcohol Industry Size, Structure, Strategies, and Public Health Responses								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS								13	25					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: The purpose of this study is to inform public health efforts to reduce alcohol-related harm by describing the alcohol marketing landscape. We review the size, structure, and strategies of both the U.S. national and global alcohol industries and their principal marketing activities and expenditures and provide a summary of public health responses. Method: Primary data were obtained from advertising and alcohol industry market research firms and were supplemented by searches of peer-reviewed literature, business press, and online databases on global business and trade. Results: Worldwide, alcohol sales totaled more than $1.5 trillion in 2017. Control of alcoholic beverage production and marketing is concentrated globally in the hands of a small number of firms. The oligopoly structure of the producing industry helps to generate high profits per dollar invested relative to other industries, which in turn fund marketing expenditures that function as barriers to entry by other firms. Advertising expenditures are high and advertising is widespread. Stake-holder marketing and corporate social responsibility campaigns assist in maintaining a policy environment conducive to extensive alcohol marketing activity. The most common regulatory response has been alcohol industry self-regulation; statutory public health responses have made little progress in recent years and have lagged behind industry innovation in digital and social marketing. Conclusions: Alcohol marketing is widespread globally and a structural element of the alcoholic beverage industry. Given the level of alcohol-related harm worldwide, global and regional recommendations and best practices should be used to guide policy makers in effective regulation of alcohol marketing.

J	Ernst, Daniel; Becker, Stefanie; Horstmann, Gernot								Novelty competes with saliency for attention								VISION RESEARCH				168				42	52		10.1016/j.visres.2020.01.004			MAR 2020	2020	A highly debated question in attention research is to what extent attention is biased by bottom-up factors such as saliency versus top-down factors as governed by the task. Visual search experiments in which participants are briefly familiarized with the task and then see a novel stimulus unannounced and for the first time support yet another factor, showing that novel and surprising features attract attention. In the present study, we tested whether gaze behavior as an indicator for attentional prioritization can be predicted accurately within displays containing both salient and novel stimuli by means of a priority map that assumes novelty as an additional source of activation. To that aim, we conducted a visual search experiment where a color singleton was presented for the first time in the surprise trial and manipulated the color-novelty of the remaining non-singletons between participants. In one group, the singleton was the only novel stimulus ("one-new"), whereas in another group, the non-singleton stimuli were likewise novel ("all-new"). The surprise trial was always target absent and designed such that top-down prioritization of any color was unlikely. The results show that the singleton in the all-new group captured the gaze less strongly, with more early fixations being directed to the novel non-singletons. Overall, the fixation pattern can accurately be explained by noisy priority maps where saliency and novelty compete for gaze control.

New evidence-informed AWLs were introduced in the sole government-run liquor store in Whitehorse, Yukon, that included a cancer warning (Ca), low-risk drinking guidelines (LRDGs) and standard drink (SD) messages. These temporarily replaced previous pregnancy warning labels. We test if the intervention was associated with reduced alcohol consumption. Method: An interrupted time series study was designed to evaluate the effects of the AWLs on consumption for 28 months before and 14 months after starting the intervention. Neighboring regions of Yukon and Northwest Territories served as control sites. About 300,000 labels were applied to 98% of alcohol containers sold in Whitehorse during the intervention. Multilevel regression analyses of per capita alcohol sales data for people age 15 years and older were performed to examine consumption levels in the intervention and control sites before, during, and after the AWLs were introduced. Models were adjusted for demographic and economic characteristics over time and region. Results: Total per capita retail alcohol sales in Whitehorse decreased by 6.31% (t test p <.001) during the intervention. Per capita sales of labeled products decreased by 6.59% (t test p <.001), whereas sales of unlabeled products increased by 6.91% (t test p <.05). There was a still larger reduction occurring after the intervention when pregnancy warning labels were reintroduced (-9.97% and -10.29%, t test p <.001). Conclusions: Applying new AWLs was associated with reduced population alcohol consumption. The results are consistent with an accumulating impact of the addition of varying and highly visible labels with impactful messages.

We examined the long-term associations between adolescent physical victimization and symptoms of substance use disorders in adulthood, controlling for intermediating victimization during young adulthood and several control variables. Method: Data were obtained from the Monitoring the Future Study (N = 5,291). Women and men were recruited around age 18 and surveyed biennially through age 30, and again at 35. Past-year physical victimization (threatened physical assaults, injurious assaults) was measured regularly from age 18 to 30. Alcohol and cannabis use symptoms (e.g., withdrawal, tolerance) were assessed at age 35. Controls were measured in adolescence (e.g., prior substance use) and young adulthood (e.g., marriage). Interactions examined whether associations varied by sex. Results: When we controlled for adolescent substance use, adolescents who were threatened with injury or who sustained physical injuries as a result of violence had more alcohol use symptoms at age 35 than nonvictims. However, when victimization during young adulthood was statistically accounted for, only victimization during young adulthood was associated with age-35 alcohol use symptoms. The effects of young adult victimization, but not adolescent victimization, were stronger for women. Victimization was mostly unrelated to age-35 cannabis use symptoms. Conclusions: Adolescents who are threatened with physical assaults or injured by physical assaults have significantly more alcohol use symptoms in their mid-30s than nonvictimized adolescents, but these associations are completely explained by subsequent victimization during young adulthood.

Long-Term Effects of Early Adolescent Marijuana Use on Attentional and Inhibitory Control								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	2			164	172					MAR 2020	2020	Objective: This study sought to examine the prospective effects of early adolescent marijuana use on late adolescent attentional and inhibitory control. Alcohol use, antisocial problems, and gender were included as statistical control variables. Method: The community sample of 387 adolescents and a caregiver was drawn from a longitudinal study of adolescent substance use that included nine annual assessments. Adolescents were eligible if they were between ages 11 and 12 at recruitment and did not have any disabilities that would preclude them from either understanding or completing the assessment. The sample was evenly split on gender (55% female) and was predominantly non-Hispanic White (83.16%) or African American (9.07%). Attentional and inhibitory control were assessed using parent and adolescent self-reports on the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised and the Adult Temperament Questionnaire. Results: Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. High levels of early marijuana use at ages 12-14 significantly predicted low levels of adolescent attentional control at ages 18-21 (beta = -.20, p <.05), above and beyond early attentional control, early alcohol use, and antisocial problems. Conclusions: Findings suggest that marijuana use may adversely affect cognitive development, especially during the sensitive period of early adolescence. Results emphasize the need for further prospective work to investigate relationships between early adolescent marijuana use and the development of executive functioning.

We illustrate how alcohol industry groups seek to keep their customers in the dark about alcohol-related cancer risks. In Canada, a federally funded scientific study examining the introduction of cancer warning labels on containers was shut down following industry interference. We show that the industry complaints about the study had no legal merit. Of 47 WHO member countries with alcohol warning labels, only South Korea requires cancer warnings on alcohol containers. However, industry complaints, supported by sympathetic governments, helped weaken the warning labels' implementation. Ireland has legislated for cancer warnings but faces continuing legal opposition expressed through regional and global bodies. Cancer societies and the public health community have failed to counter industry pressures to minimize consumer awareness of alcohol's cancer risks. Placing cancer warnings on alcohol containers could make a pivotal difference in motivating both drinkers to consume less and regulators to introduce more effective policies to reduce the serious harms of alcohol consumption.

J	Humphries, Ailsa; Chen, Zhe; Wiltshire, Jonathan								Repetition priming with no antipriming in picture identification								VISION RESEARCH				168				9	17		10.1016/j.visres.2019.09.011			MAR 2020	2020	Previous studies have shown that the processing of a stimulus is facilitated when that stimulus is repeated compared to when it appears the first time, and this phenomenon is called repetition priming (RP). One explanation for RP is that initial processing of a stimulus strengthens connections within the visual representation, enabling subsequent processing of the same stimulus to be more efficient. More recently, it has been reported that presenting an object with features that overlap with those in a subsequent stimulus impairs the latter's processing, and this cost is termed antipriming (AP). AP is said to be the natural antithesis of RP, and it manifests when two objects share component features, thereby having overlapping representations. In two experiments, we investigated RP and AP in a picture naming task. Following previous research, we used a 4-phase paradigm, in which RP and AP were measured, respectively, by an increase or a decrease in performance for repeated or novel stimuli in Phase 4 compared with the baseline performance in Phase 2. We used a fully randomized design in Experiment 1, and a pseudo-randomized design in stimulus selection but a randomized design in presentation location in Experiment 2. We found robust RP in both experiments, but neither experiment showed any evidence of AP. Our results indicate that RP and AP do not always manifest within the same experiment, and that the relationship between these two effects may be more complex than previously understood.

This study tested the extent to which consumers recalled alcohol labels with national drinking guidelines and examined the impact of labels on awareness and knowledge of the guidelines. Method: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two jurisdictions in northern Canada examining the impact of labels on the following outcomes: unprompted and prompted recall of the drinking guideline label message, awareness of the drinking guidelines, and knowledge of the daily and weekly recommended drink limits. The intervention site applied labels with national drinking guidelines, a cancer warning, and standard drink information to alcohol containers in its liquor store, whereas the comparison site did not apply these labels. In total, 2,049 cohort participants in both sites were recruited to complete surveys before and at two time points after the intervention. Changes in outcomes were examined using generalized estimating equations. Results: After the intervention, unprompted and prompted recall of the drinking guideline label message increased more in the intervention versus comparison site (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 10.8, 95% CI [0.9, 127.6]; AOR = 7.0, 95% CI [3.3, 14.9], respectively). Awareness of the drinking guidelines increased 2.9 times more in the intervention versus comparison site (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI [2.0, 4.3]). In addition, knowledge of the daily and weekly drink limits increased 1.5 and 1.4 times more in the intervention versus comparison site, respectively (daily: AOR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1]; weekly: AOR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.0, 2.0]). Conclusions: Enhanced alcohol labels get noticed and may be an effective populationlevel strategy for increasing awareness and knowledge of national drinking guidelines.

We investigated whether a treatment involving repetition of word sequences after a response delay would improve tolerance of increased verbal STM load in repetition and, consequently, improve performance on repetition and other language tasks. Eight individuals with aphasia participated. We used a single subject design with outcome measures on near-transfer tasks closely related to the treatment task and far-transfer tasks more distantly related to the treatment task. We minimized repeated presentation of stimuli in all phases of treatment to control for confounding effects of repeated exposure of treated items. Four participants demonstrated modest acquisition effects. On outcome measures, we observed improvements by some participants on near-transfer tasks, (repetition of concrete and abstract word strings and verbal spans) and far-transfer tasks (naming and discourse). Some participants demonstrated a significant decline in word repetition accuracy after a response delay before treatment, indicating difficulty in maintaining activation of linguistic representations. It was these participants who showed the most improvement on outcome measures. More studies are needed to determine who will respond to this treatment and what factors might influence the effectiveness of this treatment approach.

There is some evidence in people with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) but overall evidence is mixed. This study aimed to address shortcomings of prior study designs in TBI to examine whether a single dose of tDCS would lead to benefits in working memory. Thirty people with severe, chronic TBI were administered a single session of either anodal tDCS (2 mA for 20 min) or sham tDCS (2 mA for 30 s), in a counterbalanced order, over the left parietal cortex while performing 1-back and 2-back working memory tasks. Skin conductance levels were examined as a measure of task activated arousal, a possible functional analogue of cortical excitability. We found that tDCS led to no improvements in accuracy on the working memory tasks. A slight increase in variability and reaction time with tDCS was related to decreased task activated arousal. Overall, this study yielded no evidence that a single session of tDCS can facilitate working memory for people with TBI.

Transcranial Focused Ultrasound to the Right Prefrontal Cortex Improves Mood and Alters Functional Connectivity in Humans								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						52	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00052			FEB 28 2020	2020	Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging method for non-invasive neuromodulation akin to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tFUS offers several advantages over electromagnetic methods including high spatial resolution and the ability to reach deep brain targets. Here we describe two experiments assessing whether tFUS could modulate mood in healthy human volunteers by targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), an area implicated in mood and emotional regulation. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, participants received 30 s of 500 kHz tFUS or a placebo control. Visual Analog Mood Scales (VAMS) assessed mood four times within an hour (baseline and three times after tFUS). Participants who received tFUS reported an overall increase in Global Affect (GA), an aggregate score from the VAMS scale, indicating a positive shift in mood. Experiment 2 examined resting-state functional (FC) connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) following 2 min of 500 kHz tFUS at the rIFG. As in Experiment 1, tFUS enhanced self-reported mood states and also decreased FC in resting state networks related to emotion and mood regulation. These results suggest that tFUS can be used to modulate mood and emotional regulation networks in the prefrontal cortex.		[Sanguinetti, Joseph L.; Hameroff, Stuart; Smith, Ezra E.; Allen, John J.

Meanwhile, a focal subcortical lesion may affect the overall functional reorganization of brain networks. We sought to identify the differential reorganization of the SMA subregions after subcortical stroke using the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI was conducted in 25 patients with chronic capsular stroke exhibiting well-recovered global motor function (Fugl-Meyer score >90). The SMA proper and preSMA were identified by the rsFC-based parcellation, and the rsFCs of each SMA subregion were compared between stroke patients and healthy controls. Results: Despite common rsFC with the fronto-insular cortex (FIC), the SMA proper and preSMA were mainly correlated with the sensorimotor areas and cognitive-related regions, respectively. In stroke patients, the SMA proper and preSMA exhibited completely different functional reorganization patterns: the former showed increased rsFCs with the primary sensorimotor area and caudal cingulate motor area (CMA) of the motor execution network, whereas the latter showed increased rsFC with the rostral CMA of the motor control network. Both of the two SMA subregions showed decreased rsFC with the FIC in stroke patients; the preSMA additionally showed decreased rsFC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Conclusion: Although both SMA subregions exhibit functional disconnection with the cognitive-related areas, the SMA proper is implicated in the functional reorganization within the motor execution network, whereas the preSMA is involved in the functional reorganization within the motor control network in stroke patients.

Condition-specific camps may support families in this process. This study explored the experience of camps for children with ABI and their families from the perspective of children and young people with ABI and their siblings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 people with ABI (M-age = 23.93, SD = 16.52 years) and 19 siblings of people with ABI (M-age = 14.53, SD = 5.73 years). Using reflexive thematic analysis, the central theme identified was "My safe space," supported by three further themes: "Having fun and relaxing," "Making friends," and "Enjoying choices." Camp was a space where the shared understanding and acceptance of ABI created a sense of safety. This was facilitated by enjoying activities, developing friendships with peers who shared the experience of ABI, and having a sense of control through choice availability. Thus, camps appear to offer opportunities to enjoy typical childhood experiences while restoring a sense of security, increasing understanding of ABI and validating attendees' experiences. Camps may, therefore, offer low-cost interventions to support children with ABI and their families.

Experimental studies, however, found that neglect patients can partially overcome their spatial inattention temporarily when being exposed to auditory cues that move towards the neglected side of space. Two pilot studies investigated the impact of dynamic auditory cueing on egocentric neglect severity in a clinical-therapeutic setting. In both studies, the patient groups received 15 sessions of intervention. Study 1, designed as double-blinded trial with a historical control group, targeted severely impaired early-acute patients who listened to music or audio books which were presented as moving dynamically from right to left. Results showed a reduction in egocentric neglect severity that persisted after therapy termination in the intervention but not in the historical control group. In study 2, based on the comparison with reported effect sizes of previous studies, dynamic meaningful auditory cues and optokinetic stimulation were combined in a computer-based training. Both studies found a significant reduction of neglect severity. Results provide evidence for the reduction of egocentric neglect severity after repetitive auditory cueing therapy in both severely and moderately impaired patients. Our promising findings should be verified thoroughly in randomized-controlled trials.		[Schenke, N.; Franke, R.; Thiel, C.

Adolescents with low emotional awareness may have limited resources for identifying and overcoming negative emotions, and therefore, use cannabis to regulate emotions. Purpose/objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that emotional awareness difficulties are associated with increased cannabis use across the transition out of substance use treatment. This hypothesis was investigated by applying an autoregressive random-intercept cross-lagged panel-modeling framework to test the fit of alternative models and inform hypotheses about directional associations between cannabis use and emotional awareness difficulties over time. Methods: Participants were 110 adolescents with co-occurring disorders and their families participating in an intensive home-based treatment trial. Adolescents reported on past 7-day cannabis use and difficulties in emotional awareness at baseline and three follow-up assessments across 12 months. Results: At baseline, 54% of the sample reported past-week cannabis use. A directional effect was supported such that difficulties with emotional awareness at 3 months' post-baseline, which corresponded to the approximate end of the treatment program, were associated with increased cannabis use at 6 months' post-baseline, controlling for the stability of cannabis use, and emotional awareness over time. Cannabis use, however, was not associated with subsequent difficulties in emotional awareness (i.e., effects in the opposite direction were not supported).

J	Ishida, Osamu; Iimura, Daichi; Miyamoto, Shoko								The Relationship Between Attentional Capture by Speech and Nonfluent Speech Under Delayed Auditory Feedback: A Pilot Examination of a Dual-Task Using Auditory or Tactile Stimulation								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						51	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00051			FEB 26 2020	2020	Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) leads to nonfluent speech where the voice of a speaker is heard after a delay. Previous studies suggested the involvement of attention to auditory feedback in speech disfluency. To date, there are no studies that have revealed the relationship between attention and nonfluent speech by controlling the attention allocated to the delayed own voice. This study examined these issues under three conditions: a single task where the subject was asked to read aloud under DAF (single DAF task), a dual task where the subject was asked to read aloud while reacting to a pure tone (auditory DAF task), and a dual task where the subject was asked to read aloud while reacting to the vibration of their finger (tactile DAF task). The subjects also performed the single and dual tasks (auditory/tactile) under nonaltered auditory feedback where no delayed voices were involved. Results showed that the nonfluency rate under the auditory DAF task was significantly greater than that under the single DAF task. In contrast, the nonfluency rate under the tactile DAF task was significantly lower compared with that of the single DAF task. Speech became nonfluent when attention was captured by the same modality stimulus, i.e., auditory tone. In contrast, speech became fluent when attention was allocated to the stimulus that is irreverent to auditory modality, i.e., tactile vibration. This indicates that nonfluent speech under DAF is involved in attention capture owing to the delayed own voice.

Foot and Ankle Somatosensory Deficits Affect Balance and Motor Function in Children With Cerebral Palsy								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						45	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00045			FEB 26 2020	2020	Sensory dysfunction is prevalent in cerebral palsy (CP). Evidence suggests that sensory deficits can contribute to manual ability impairments in children with CP, yet it is still unclear how they contribute to balance and motor performance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between lower extremity (LE) somatosensation and functional performance in children with CP. Ten participants with spastic diplegia (Gross Motor Function Classification Scale: I-III) and who were able to stand independently completed the study. Threshold of light touch pressure, two-point discriminatory ability of the plantar side of the foot, duration of cutaneous vibration sensation, and error in the joint position sense of the ankle were assessed to quantify somatosensory function. The balance was tested by the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest) and postural sway measures during a standing task. Motor performance was evaluated by using a battery of clinical assessments: (1) Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66-IS) to test gross motor ability; (2) spatiotemporal gait characteristics (velocity, step length) to evaluate walking ability; (3) Timed Up and Go (TUG) and 6 Min Walk (6MWT) tests to assess functional mobility; and (4) an isokinetic dynamometer was used to test the Maximum Volitional Isometric Contraction (MVIC) of the plantar flexor muscles. The results showed that the light touch pressure measure was strongly associated only with the 6MWT. Vibration and two-point discrimination were strongly related to balance performance. Further, the vibration sensation of the first metatarsal head demonstrated a significantly strong relationship with motor performance as measured by GMFM-66-IS, spatiotemporal gait parameters, TUG, and ankle plantar flexors strength test. The joint position sense of the ankle was only related to one subdomain of the BESTest (Postural Responses). This study provides preliminary evidence that LE sensory deficits can possibly contribute to the pronounced balance and motor impairments in CP. The findings emphasize the importance of developing a thorough LE sensory test battery that can guide traditional treatment protocols toward a more holistic therapeutic approach by combining both motor and sensory rehabilitative strategies to improve motor function in CP.

We suggested that rewards play a critical role in the affective priming effect on conflict resolution. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs), using the arrow flanker task as primes and choosing specific affective words as targets to investigate the affective priming effect induced by cognitive conflict during the resolution stage. Our question was whether rewards created a modulating effect. Participants were asked to judge the congruency of the prime stimuli and then evaluate the valence of the target words. For behavioral results, the conflict effect was significant, and the reward promoted the behavioral performance of participants. For ERP results, enhanced N2 amplitudes for incongruent primes indicated a significant conflict effect. More importantly, as expected, in the rewarded condition, the enhanced N400 amplitudes for positive targets following incongruent primes were found, indicating a positive priming effect. However, in the unrewarded condition, the reduced N400 amplitudes for positive targets following incongruent primes were found, indicating conflict resolution hindered the processing of positive stimuli. These findings suggested that cognitive conflict-induced the positive priming effect during the resolution stage and that rewards had a moderating effect on the positive priming effect.

Such behavioral deficits have been linked to a temporal processing deficiency. However, to date, there have been few studies assessing the temporal processing efficiency of the Magnocellular M pathways through temporal modulation. Hence, we measured achromatic flicker fusion thresholds at high and low contrast in nonselective samples of NDDs and neurotypicals (mean age 10, range 7-12 years, n = 71) individually, and group matched, for both chronological age and nonverbal intelligence. Autistic tendencies were also measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient questionnaire as high AQ scores have previously been associated with the greater physiological amplitude of M-generated nonlinearities. The NDD participants presented with singular or comorbid combinations of DD, ASD, and ADHD. The results showed that ASD and DD, including those with comorbid ADHD, demonstrated significantly lower flicker fusion thresholds (FFTs) than their matched controls. Participants with a singular diagnosis of ADHD did not differ from controls in the FFTs. Overall, the entire NDD plus control populations showed a significant negative correlation between FFT and AQ scores (r = -0.269, p < 0.02 n = 71). In conclusion, this study presents evidence showing that a temporally inefficient M pathway could be the unifying network at fault across the NDDs and particularly in ASD and DD diagnoses, but not in singular diagnosis of ADHD.

Method: We used the Danish subsample (n = 341) from the Elderly Study. Latent class analysis was used to identify classes based on the 11 symptoms of DSM-5 AUD. We analyzed the associations between class membership and sociodemographic variables, alcohol consumption, and drinking-related outcome of treatment. Results: Three latent classes were identified. Individuals in the low-symptomatic class (34.85%) displayed low endorsement of DSM-5 criteria "Withdrawal", "Time Spent", "Less activities" compared to the other classes, and had fewest drinks per drinking day. Individuals in the moderate-symptomatic class (32.69%) were most likely to be intoxicated in hazardous situations, and those in the high-symptomatic class (32.47%) displayed, with a few exceptions, the highest probabilities of all DSM-5 criteria. Female gender, living alone and prior AUD treatment was associated with increased risk of being in the high-symptomatic class. No difference between classes was found with respect to years with AUD and frequency of drinking days, and latent class membership had no effect on drinking outcome after treatment, when controlling for baseline. Conclusions: Three classes of DSM-5 AUD among older adults in treatment emerged, displaying a low-moderate-high distribution, advocating for a unidimensional construct of DSM-5 AUD. Although different with respect to baseline risk factors, no strong connection between DSM-5 latent class and alcohol consumption after AUD treatment was found.

Patterns and Correlates of New Drug Initiation among Female Exotic Dancers: The Contribution of Occupational and Structural Risks								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	7			1122	1128		10.1080/10826084.2020.1729199			APR 15 2020	2020	Introduction: Exotic dance clubs (EDCs) can play pivotal roles in the production of drug-related risks for female exotic dancers (FED). We aimed to characterize the structural and occupational factors associated with new drug initiation post-EDC entry among new FED (N = 117) in Baltimore, Maryland. Materials and Methods: Logistic regression models tested the associations of new drug uptake, measured as initiating any illicit drug (including non-prescribed and diverted prescription narcotics) not used prior to EDC employment, with structural (e.g. debt sources, housing instability) and occupational (e.g. sex work, dancing as sole income source) vulnerabilities. Results: Most FED were younger than 24 years-old (60%), identified as Black/African American (61%), and did not complete high school (56%). Twenty-nine (25%) reported using any new drug post-EDC entry, with cocaine (34%) cited most frequently among newly initiated substances. In multivariable analysis, drug initiation was significantly associated with cumulative debt sources (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.82, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.19-2.77), dancing as only income source (AOR = 4.21, CI: 1.29-13.71), and sex work (AOR = 9.26, CI: 2.74-31.32). Conclusions: Our findings implicate co-occurring structural and occupational factors in FED's initiation of illicit drugs proceeding EDC employment. Results demonstrate the coping role of drug use for FED in stressful working environments and the multiple vulnerabilities associated with illicit drug uptake. The study reinforces a need for harm reduction interventions (i.e. debt relief, employment connections, increased hourly pay) that consider the contribution of overlapping financial insecurities to the production of occupational risks motivating drug uptake.

Acute Effects and the Dreamy State Evoked by Deep Brain Electrical Stimulation of the Amygdala: Associations of the Amygdala in Human Dreaming, Consciousness, Emotions, and Creativity								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						61	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00061			FEB 25 2020	2020	Accurate localization of complex human experiences such as emotions, dreaming, creativity, and consciousness to specific cerebral structures or neural networks has remained elusive despite technological advances. We report the use of acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) to evoke behavioral and emotional effects by applying electrical stimulation (ES) at various voltage strengths to the basolateral and central subnuclei of the amygdala in addition to the head of hippocampus (HC) for two subjects with medically refractory post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our results suggest that the amygdala could be a node in a neural network responsible for the generation of complex vivid mental imagery and integrated sensory experiences similar to John Hughlings Jackson's "dreamy state" and "double consciousness," which have been classically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy during uncinate seizures. That we were able to elicit similar vivid, dynamic, complex, bizarre, and original mental imagery with ES in non-epileptic subjects suggests that Jackson's seizure related "dreamy state" and "double consciousness" may arise from heightened innate brain mechanisms with the amygdala acting as a node in the neural network responsible for physiologic dreaming and creative functions. Furthermore, our subjects experienced different emotions with different stimulation strengths at various electrode contacts. Our results suggest that higher voltage stimulation of the amygdala and HC at 4-5 V leads to predominantly negative responses and 2-4 V stimulation showed inversely coupled positive and negative responses of the amygdala in either hemisphere which may imply hemispheric dominance of emotional valences without relation to handedness. Due to the unique and complex responses dependent on location and strength of stimulation, we advise that all patients receiving DBS of the amygdala undergo acute stimulation mapping in a monitored setting before selecting therapeutic parameters for chronic stimulation.

Following the World Health Organization (WHO), the glioma grading system ranges from stages I to IV, in which lower-grade gliomas represent benign tumors, and higher grade gliomas are considered the most malignant. Materials and Methods: We gathered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for seven patients with right precentral gyrus-located tumors and six age- and sex-matched healthy subjects for analysis. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was utilized to evaluate whole-brain WM implication due to probable tumor infiltration. Also, along-tract statistics were used in order to trace the implicated WM tracts. Finally, for cortical evaluation of probable tumor cell migration, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was utilized, which allowed us to do whole-brain cortical estimation. Results: The TBSS results revealed significantly higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in the left side superior corona radiata. Also, higher FA was observed in the right corticostriatal tract. Along-tract statistics were also compiled on the corpus callosum (CC), which is anatomically known as a hub between hemispheres. The body of the CC, which connected with the superior corona radiata anatomically, showed significantly higher FA values relative to healthy subjects, which are in line with the TBSS results. Consistent with these results, whole-brain gray matter changes were analyzed via VBM, which showed significant hypertrophy of both sides of the brainstem. Conclusion: In future investigations, focusing on the genetic basis of the glioma patients in line with imaging studies on a larger sample size, which is known as genetics imaging, would be a suitable approach for tracing this process.

In this meta-analysis, we investigated concurrence across studies to clarify those abnormalities in brain structure and function in tinnitus. Neuroimaging studies published up to December 6, 2019 were searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, Chinese Nation Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang Database. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Anisotropic effect size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) was used to perform a multimodal analysis of available studies reporting whole-brain structural or functional data in tinnitus patients. There were 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The structural dataset comprised 242 tinnitus patients and 217 matched healthy subjects (HS), while the functional dataset included 130 tinnitus patients and 140 matched HS. Our analysis revealed structural alterations in the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), angular gyrus, caudate nucleus, superior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area, as well as functional differences in the MTG, middle occipital gyrus, precuneus, and right inferior parietal (excluding supramarginal and angular) gyri. The multimodal analysis revealed significant differences in the right MTG of tinnitus patients relative to HS. These findings suggest the involvement of the cortico-striatal circuits in the neuropathology of tinnitus.

Neural Correlates of Vocal Pitch Compensation in Individuals Who Stutter								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						18	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00018			FEB 25 2020	2020	Stuttering is a disorder that impacts the smooth flow of speech production and is associated with a deficit in sensorimotor integration. In a previous experiment, individuals who stutter were able to vocally compensate for pitch shifts in their auditory feedback, but they exhibited more variability in the timing of their corrective responses. In the current study, we focused on the neural correlates of the task using functional MRI. Participants produced a vowel sound in the scanner while hearing their own voice in real time through headphones. On some trials, the audio was shifted up or down in pitch, eliciting a corrective vocal response. Contrasting pitch-shifted vs. unshifted trials revealed bilateral superior temporal activation over all the participants. However, the groups differed in the activation of middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus [Brodmann area 10 (BA 10)], with individuals who stutter displaying deactivation while controls displayed activation. In addition to the standard univariate general linear modeling approach, we employed a data-driven technique (independent component analysis, or ICA) to separate task activity into functional networks. Among the networks most correlated with the experimental time course, there was a combined auditory-motor network in controls, but the two networks remained separable for individuals who stuttered. The decoupling of these networks may account for temporal variability in pitch compensation reported in our previous work, and supports the idea that neural network coherence is disturbed in the stuttering brain.

The notion that cannabis diminishes motivation has been perpetuated in popular culture, despite the equivocal results of past research. Moreover, previous literature has largely failed to consider the potentially confounding influences of depression, other substance use, and personality, despite known relationships between these variables and cannabis use. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the nature of the relationships between specific aspects of motivation and cannabis use/misuse. Moreover, we sought to determine whether depression, alcohol and other substance use, and/or personality could account for these relationships. Method: A total of 1,168 participants completed a survey comprising self-report measures of motivation (self-efficacy, apathy, goal orientation, reward-sensitivity, and behavioral inhibition/approach systems) and cannabis use/misuse (cannabis use status, cannabis use frequency, quantity, age of onset of cannabis use, symptoms of cannabis use disorder, problematic cannabis use). Results: The results revealed small (r < .30) but significant correlations between various aspects of cannabis use and motivation, which were largely accounted for by cannabis-related differences in depression, alcohol and other substance use, and personality. However, relationships between cannabis misuse and apathy remained statistically significant after controlling for confounds, indicating that individuals who misuse cannabis may demonstrate higher levels of apathy specifically. Conclusion: Collectively, these results suggest that differences in depression, substance use, and personality between cannabis users and non-users largely explain differences in motivation between these groups.

Objectives: to assess the prevalence of smoking among women with HIV in early pregnancy and the association between smoking and pregnancy outcomes in this particular population. Methods: We used data from a multicenter observational study to define the prevalence of smoking in women with HIV in early pregnancy, and the role of smoking status and intensity as risk factors for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Main outcome measures were fetal growth restriction [FGR], preterm delivery [PD] and low birthweight [LB], evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The overall (2001-2018) prevalence of reported smoking (at least one cigarette/day) was 25.6% (792/3097), with a significant decrease in recent years (19.0% in 2013-2018). Women who smoked were less commonly African, had lower body mass index, older age, a longer history of HIV infection and higher CD4 counts. In univariate analyses, smokers were significantly more likely to have PD, LB, FGR and detectable HIV viral load at third trimester. Multivariable analyses confirmed for smokers a significantly higher risk of LB (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.69, 95%CI 1.22-2.34) and FGR (AOR 1.88, 95%CI 1.27-2.80), while the associations with detectable HIV and PD were not maintained. Conclusions: The common prevalence of smoking among pregnant women with HIV and its association with adverse outcomes indicates that smoking cessation programs in this population may have a significant impact on neonatal and maternal health.

Neural correlates of social influence on risk perception during development								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	3			355	367		10.1080/17470919.2020.1726450			MAY 3 2020	2020	Studies have shown that adolescents are more likely than adults to take risks in the presence of peers than when alone, and that young adolescents' risk perception is more influenced by other teenagers than by adults. The current fMRI study investigated the effect of social influence on risk perception in female adolescents (aged 12-14) and adults (aged 23-29). Participants rated the riskiness of everyday situations and were then informed about the (alleged) risk ratings of a social influence group (teenagers or adults), before rating each situation again. The results showed that adolescents adjusted their ratings to conform with others more than adults did, and both age groups were influenced more by adults than by teenagers. When there was a conflict between the participants' own risk ratings and the ratings of the social influence group, activation was increased in the posterior medial frontal cortex, dorsal cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus in both age groups. In addition, there was greater activation during no-conflict situations in the right middle frontal gyrus and bilateral parietal cortex in adults compared with adolescents. These results suggest that there are behavioral and neural differences between adolescents and adults in conflict and no-conflict social situations.		[Knoll, L. J.; Gaule, A.; Jacobs, E. A.

A substantial proportion of adults receives an opioid prescription each year, and a number of these adults also use benzodiazepines or alcohol. As public opinion continues to shape public policy, it is imperative to understand correlates of recognizing risk of mixing substances in order to inform public outreach and prevention efforts. Methods: Characteristics associated with perceived risk were explored using an online survey of a community sample of adults (N = 639) in Michigan. Two logistic regression models examined potential correlates of perceived risk of 1) mixing opioid pain-relievers with alcohol and 2) mixing opioid pain-relievers with benzodiazepines. Results: In the multivariate results, participants reporting at least one heavy drinking episode in the past month (AOR = 0.46, p = .001) and individuals with advanced degrees (AOR = 0.49, p = .014) had lower odds of believing that mixing alcohol and opioid pain-relievers poses a great risk, while women (AOR = 1.66, p = .042) had higher odds. Participants reporting lifetime (AOR = 0.58, p = .046) or past-year (AOR = 0.28, p = .001) non-medical opioid use had lower odds of reporting that mixing benzodiazepines and opioid pain-relievers poses a great risk, whereas older participants (AOR = 1.02, p = .037) had higher odds. Conclusions: Certain groups were more likely to underestimate risks of mixing opioid pain-relievers with alcohol or benzodiazepines. Results underscore the importance of targeted public awareness campaigns, prevention programing, and communication between physicians and patients about the risks of mixing substances, particularly among high-risk groups.

Tumors are usually thought to cause multimodal cognitive impairments. The structure is thought to form the basics of function, and the aim of this study was to reveal the rich-club organization and topological patterns of white matter (WM) structural networks associated with cognitive impairments in patients with frontal and temporal gliomas. Methods: Graph theory approaches were utilized to reveal the global and regional topological organization and rich-club organization of WM structural networks of 14 controls (CN), 13 frontal tumors (FTumor), and 18 temporal tumors (TTumor). Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between cognitive performances and altered topological parameters. Results: When compared with CN, both FTumor and TTumor showed no alterations in small-world properties and global network efficiency, but instead showed altered local network efficiency. Second, FTumor and TTumor patients showed similar deficits in the nodal shortest path in the left rolandic operculum and degree centrality (DC) of the right dorsolateral and medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed). Third, compared to FTumor patients, TTumor patients showed a significantly higher DC in the right dorsolateral and SFGmed, a higher level of betweenness in the right SFGmed, and higher nodal efficiency in the left middle frontal gyrus and right SFGmed. Finally, rich-club organization was disrupted, with increased structural connectivity among rich-club nodes and reduced structural connectivity among peripheral nodes in FTumor and TTumor patients. Altered local efficiency in TTumor correlated with memory function, while altered local efficiency in FTumor correlated with the information processing speed. Conclusion: Both FTumor and TTumor presented an intact global topology and altered regional topology related to cognitive impairment and may also share the convergent and divergent regional topological organization of WM structural networks. This suggested that a compensatory mechanism plays a key role in global topology formation in both FTumor and TTumor patients, and as such, development of a structural connectome for patients with brain tumors would be an invaluable medical resource and allow clinicians to make comprehensive preoperative planning.

The Dark Triad is a set of personality traits that may inform the characteristics of people who influence others to use substances. Objective: The aim of the present two studies was to examine potential associations between Dark Triad personality traits, especially psychopathy, and influencing others to use substances. Methods: Two samples of 162 and 161 Mechanical Turk workers were recruited for Study 1 to complete an online survey that assessed Dark Triad traits, history of influencing others to use substances, and motivations for doing so. Similarly, 303 Mechanical Turk workers were recruited for Study 2 to complete an online survey that assessed personal substance use as well as psychopathy levels of participants' closest friends. Results: Study 1 found that individuals high in psychopathy were more likely to have provided illegal substances to others and indicated a willingness to do so in the future. Study 2 found that participants reported a higher likelihood of using substances if they indicated that their best friend was high in psychopathy and had themselves used substances in the past. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that psychopathy has a unique association with influencing others to use substances. These findings have implications for intervention targets.

Disruption of Transitions in High-Risk Substance Use from Adolescence to Young Adulthood: School, Employment, and Romantic Relationship Factors								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	7			1129	1137		10.1080/10826084.2020.1729200			APR 15 2020	2020	Background: Few studies have examined social-contextual moderators of substance use transitions from adolescence to young adulthood. A better understanding of the extent to which school, employment, and romantic relationships can disrupt high-risk use patterns could inform strategies for substance use prevention and treatment. Objective: The current study examines the extent school, employment, and relationship factors can disrupt transition in high-risk substance use patterns from adolescence to young adulthood. Method: Data were collected biennially from 662 youth in six assessments across ten years (2003-2013). Using latent transition analysis (LTA) that examined transition is substance use classes, we examined school, employment, and relationship moderators of use transitions. Results: Few differences were found during adolescence with the most significant findings occurring in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Examining the transitions from adolescence to young adulthood (W4 to W6), we found evidence that school, employment, and relationship status disrupted problematic substance use patterns, such that, individuals that indicated entering school, working full-time, or getting married or entering a relationship were more likely to transition to a low-risk substance use class than remain in the high-risk class. Conclusions/Importance: Findings underscore the importance of school completion, obtaining stable career employment, and quality relationship to help reduce high-risk substance use patterns leading into young adulthood. Prevention and intervention efforts should consider the diverse needs of youth and be prepared to provide a wide range of services that include educational opportunities and career development if they want to reduce high-risk substance use patterns.

However, it has been described that electronic cigarettes (ECs) are being used to vaporize cannabis (extract). No current data on EC cannabis use in the German population are yet available. Objectives: This study examines the prevalence of EC cannabis consumption for mood changing effects among current EC users, and associated consumer characteristics in Germany. Methods: We used data from the German Study on Tobacco Use (period: 8/2016-01/2019, DEBRA, ), a nationally representative household survey. EC cannabis use for mood-changing effects was assessed in 504 current EC users (aged >= 18 years) of the total sample (N = 32,678). Ever use was defined by: (1) occasional or regular use, or (2) experimental consumption. Associations with socio-demographic consumer characteristics and tobacco smoking were analyzed using multivariable regression analyses. Results: Amongst current EC users, 7.2% had ever vaporized cannabis: 2.3% (95%CI = 1.2-3.9) reported occasional or regular use (1) and 4.8% (95%CI = 3.2-7.1) reported experimental use (2). Age was associated with ever EC cannabis use: highest prevalence rates were found among 18-24-year-olds: 6.5% (95%CI = 2.3-13.1) (1) and 8.0% (95%CI = 3.7-15.8) (2), respectively. The majority (90.2%) of ever EC cannabis users were current tobacco smokers. Conclusions: One in 14 current EC users in Germany has ever vaporized cannabis for mood-changing reasons, and almost all EC cannabis consumers also smoke tobacco. Highest usage rates can be observed among young adults. Hence, trends of EC drug misuse need to be monitored consequently, particularly in young people.

In 2017, sales of CBD exceeded 820 million dollars despite many unconfirmed health claims, murky legality, and limited product efficacy and safety testing. Purpose/Objectives: This study aims to explore cannabidiol (CBD) knowledge, attitudes, and use among young adults. Methods: The anonymous 36-item survey developed using Qualtrics was distributed via social media from November 2018 to January 2019 with 340 respondents. Results: Of the 340 respondents, 242 reported they had heard of CBD, and 135 reported using CBD products. CBD users were primarily white, female, without children, made less than $25,000 per year, and unmarried. Most commonly used CBD products were edibles (56.30%), tinctures (54.07%), and vape (38.52%). Top reasons for use included stress relief (65.39%), relaxation (54.81%), and sleep improvement (42.22%). Many respondents reported using guesswork to determine dosage, and over half of respondents reported at least one unanticipated side effect. Conclusions/Importance: This study revealed that many users are not responsibly using CBD products, many believe CBD products provide health benefits that are not yet scientifically proven, and they are not knowledgeable about legal and regulatory issues. Until CBD use is more thoroughly researched and has more comprehensive regulation, public health professionals should address alternative stress and anxiety treatment methods.

Given the negative impact of substance use and justice-involvement on the wellbeing of children, the criminal justice system may offer a unique intervention point with high public health impact. This study describes characteristics of adult drug court participants (DCP) that affect the wellbeing of their children and families and compares the DCP parenting and mental health characteristics to their child's other caregiver in order to understand how parenting differs within drug court families. Method: Data were collected from a sample of 100 DCP; 58 had a matched other caregiver. Drug court data regarding substance use and criminogenic risk/need were collected. Analyses differentiated the parenting behaviors and mental health needs of DCP from other caregivers. Results: The DCP were at moderate to high risk for recidivism and presented with multiple and significant criminogenic and psychosocial functioning needs. Risk for potential maltreatment and poor parenting behaviors were elevated, and significantly higher compared to other caregivers. DCP demonstrated clinically elevated mental health needs, and were significantly different across all indicators of mental health compared to other caregivers. Conclusions: Adult drug courts address the occurrence of substance use disorders but there are additional needs to be intervened upon. Adult drug courts may be a viable intervention point to address issues of parenting and mental health to improve the wellbeing of criminal justice-involved individuals, their children, and families.

In this qualitative study, we aimed to investigate (i) stroke survivor's experiences of goal attainment, adjustment and disengagement in the first year after stroke and (ii) whether the Goal setting and Action Planning (G-AP) framework supported different pathways to goal attainment. In-depth interviews were conducted with eighteen stroke survivors' to explore their experiences and views. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a Framework approach to examine themes within and between participants. Stroke survivors reported that attaining personal goals enabled them to resume important activities, reclaim a sense of self and enhance emotional wellbeing. Experiences of goal-related setbacks and failure facilitated understanding and acceptance of limitations and informed adjustment of, or disengagement from, unattainable goals. Use of the G-AP framework supported stroke survivors to (i) identify personal goals, (ii) initiate and sustain goal pursuit, (iii) gauge progress and (iv) make informed decisions about continued goal pursuit, adjustment or disengagement. Stroke survivor recovery involves attainment of original and adjusted or alternative goals. The G-AP framework can support these different pathways to goal attainment.		[Scobbie, L.; Brady, M.

The spatial location of objects, their (bottom-up) saliency and (top-down) relevance is assumed to be encoded in one "attentional priority map" in the brain, using different egocentric (eye-, head- and trunk-centered) spatial reference frames. In patients with hemispatial neglect, this map is supposed to be imbalanced, leading to a spatially biased exploration of the visual environment. As a proof of concept, we altered the visual saliency (and thereby attentional priority) of objects in a naturalistic scene along a left-right spatial gradient and investigated whether this can induce a bias in the exploratory eye movements of healthy humans (n = 28; all right-handed; mean age: 23 years, range 19-48). We developed a computerized mask, using high-end "gaze-contingent display (GCD)" technology, that immediately and continuously reduced the saliency of objects on the left-"left" with respect to the head (body-centered) and the current position on the retina (eye-centered). In both experimental conditions, task-free viewing and goal-driven visual search, this modification induced a mild but significant bias in visual exploration similar to hemispatial neglect. Accordingly, global eye movement parameters changed (reduced number and increased duration of fixations) and the spatial distribution of fixations indicated an attentional bias towards the right (rightward shift of first orienting, fixations favoring the scene's outmost right over left). Our results support the concept of an attentional priority map in the brain as an interface between perception and behavior and as one pathophysiological ground of hemispatial neglect.

Electromagnetic (EM) simulations using detailed anatomical human models, therapy implant trajectories, and gradient coil models can be used to calculate clinically relevant induced voltage levels. Incorporating additional anatomical human models into the EM simulation library can help to achieve more clinically relevant and accurate induced voltage levels, however, adding new anatomical human models and developing implant trajectories is time-consuming, expensive and not always feasible. Methods MRI gradient-field induced voltage levels are simulated in six adult human anatomical models, along clinically relevant DBS implant trajectories to generate the dataset. Predictive artificial neural network (ANN) regression models are trained on the simulated dataset. Leave-one-out cross validation is performed to assess the performance of ANN regressors and quantify model prediction errors. Results More than 180,000 unique gradient-induced voltage levels are simulated. ANN algorithm with two fully connected layers is selected due to its superior generalizability compared to support vector machine and tree-based algorithms in this particular application. The ANN regression model is capable of producing thousands of gradient-induced voltage predictions in less than a second with mean-squared-error less than 200 mV. Conclusion We have integrated machine learning (ML) with computational modeling and simulations and developed an accurate predictive model to determine MRI gradient-field induced voltage levels on implanted DBS systems.

Smokers' Receipt of Cessation Advice from Healthcare Professionals in National Samples of People Diagnosed with HIV and the General Population								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	7			1079	1085		10.1080/10826084.2020.1726395			APR 15 2020	2020	Background: The high prevalence of smoking in persons living with HIV (PLWH) warrants an accurate estimation of smokers' receipt of advice on smoking cessation. Prior studies on the topic have been limited by convenience samples. Objective: This study aims to be the first to estimate PLWH smokers' receipt of cessation advice from a healthcare professional in a nationally representative sample. Methods: PLWH smokers were selected from the 2015-2016 Medical Monitoring Project (MMP; n = 1179), and smokers from the general population were selected from the 2014-2015 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS; n = 15,635) and 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; n = 4,219). Prevalence ratios in MMP were estimated for testing the hypothesis that PLWH smokers, who are treated by other provider types, have a greater likelihood of receiving advice to quit smoking. Results: The weighted estimate of PLWH smokers from the MMP who received cessation advice (82.2%) was higher than weighted estimates from the TUS-CPS (70.9%) and NHIS (68.7%). While the higher estimate can be partially attributed to a higher percentage of daily smokers, the finding was still observed in stratified samples of daily and non-daily smokers. Statistically significant differences in cessation advice, however, were not observed by other provider types. Conclusions: The study's primary finding indicates that most PLWH smokers in care are receiving advice to quit smoking. The next steps are to train HIV care providers in all 5 A's of smoking cessation through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program's AIDS Education and Training Centers.

A growing body of research provides support for the role of difficulties regulating positive emotions in alcohol and drug misuse. However, research is needed to better understand for whom difficulties regulating positive emotions are most strongly associated with alcohol and drug misuse to inform assessment and treatment efforts. Objectives: The goal of the present study was to examine potential sociodemographic moderators (i.e. age, gender, ethnicity, race, income, and educational attainment) in the relations between difficulties regulating positive emotions and alcohol and drug misuse. Methods: Participants were 373 trauma-exposed adults (57.1% female, 75.8% White) recruited from the community. Results: Significant differences were identified across sociodemographic groups regarding difficulties regulating positive emotions (i.e. gender, ethnicity, race, and income) and alcohol use (i.e. gender). Moderation analyses revealed a significant interaction between difficulties regulating positive emotions and gender on drug misuse (b = 0.08, p < .001), such that the association was significant for females (b = 0.11, p < .001) but not males (b = .03, p = .05). Conclusions: Results suggest the importance of developing gender-sensitive recommendations for the assessment and treatment of substance misuse, and of incorporating techniques focused on addressing difficulties regulating positive emotions.

Because competing explanations abound in cross-sectional studies, causal interpretations from these investigations pose considerable challenge. We evaluated the relationship between early drug use and progression, while estimating modifying influences of adolescents' social contexts. Method: We applied a national longitudinal survey of 11,182 adolescents growing into adulthood over a 14-year period. The data provided a natural setting to evaluate the relationship between early drug use and drug use in three subsequent waves. We applied generalized estimating equation models to analyze these relationships. Results: Evidence showed over a relatively short period (approximately one year) early drug use was an independent predictor of illicit drugs in adolescence but not adulthood. The adjusted odds ratio for using substances in adulthood were marijuana (aOR, 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11-1.60), illicit drugs (aOR, 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04-2.12) and cocaine (aOR, 5.00; 95% CI: 2.75-9.10). Further, drug use was higher among older adolescence living in a neighborhood and reporting drug use as a big problem. In adulthood, neighborhood drug problems appear to have minimal influence on drug use escalation. Conclusion: The current findings call into question the causal interpretation of early drug use among adolescents as determinants of future drug escalation in adulthood. The overall impact of peer relationships on future drug escalation might depend on not only the extent of adolescent closeness to peers but also on continuity of friendship over time and other influencing social contexts.

In order to implement exercise as an intervention to protect the brain, it is important to have a more clear idea of its effect in the young population. However, few studies have been carried out on these ages. Objective: The main objective of our study was to evaluate the association between physical activity (PA) with memory and executive function, in university students, analyzing the modulatory effect of sex. Methodology: We collected socio-demographic and life habit information, as well as data on the PA that was carried out during the previous week using the international PAquestionnaire short version (IPAQ-SF) questionnaire in 206 university students (mean age 19.55 +/- 2.39; 67.5% women). Memory and executive function were assessed using a comprehensive battery of validate cognitive tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate PA with cognitive tests scores and to evaluate the potential synergistic role of sex. Results: The main finding was that the total amount of PA correlated positively with several tests that evaluated aspects of executive function, specifically Stroop Colors (Pearson's r = 0.17; p = 0.01) and the Stroop Test Color-Word (Pearson's r = 0.15. p = 0.03). These results were adjusted by a large number of possible confounders and modifying variables in a multivariate analysis, like age, sex, academic record, day of the week, and time at which the test was performed. Additionally, we found out that sex had a synergistic effect with PA on the executive test Trail making test-A (TMTA), and in women, this association was stronger than in men. The more PA women reported, the better they performed, that is to say that they took less time to finalize the TMT-A (interaction term between PA and sex: b = -0.0009; p = 0.014). Conclusion: Our study adds evidence of the benefit of PA in cognition in the young population, specifically in the executive inhibitory control, and more significantly in women.

However, little is known about the nature of the difficulties encountered and the ways in which these individuals deal with them. None of the few studies on wayfinding by people with cognitive disabilities have explored the various specific difficulties they meet in everyday life. Using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology, this study aimed at profiling the types of difficulties encountered in urban mobility and the associated problem-solving strategies. In order to provide more direct evidence from the field, we conducted semi-structured interviews using the critical incident technique (Flanagan, 1954). Among the 66 participants interviewed, 44 had cognitive disabilities and 22 were matched controls. The analysis of the transcripts showed in particular an overall reduced autonomy in problem-solving strategies for people with a cognitive disability. The multiple correspondence analysis highlighted three main types of complex situations, covering a comprehensive range of complex situations that are met in everyday life by these individuals. Results also indicated that people with cognitive disabilities request assistance from another person more frequently when a complex event occurs. These situations are discussed as potential cues for improvements in navigational aids. Conclusions and perspectives are provided to improve wayfinding among people with cognitive disabilities.

Yet before using such simulations in clinical practice, their ability to identify the main treatment targets in specific patients needs to be demonstrated. In this study, we generated predictive simulations of walking with a medical imaging based neuro-musculoskeletal model of a child with cerebral palsy presenting crouch gait. We explored the influence of altered muscle-tendon properties, reduced neuromuscular control complexity, and spasticity on gait dysfunction in terms of joint kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, and metabolic cost of transport. We modeled altered muscle-tendon properties by personalizing Hill-type muscle-tendon parameters based on data collected during functional movements, simpler neuromuscular control by reducing the number of independent muscle synergies, and spasticity through delayed muscle activity feedback from muscle force and force rate. Our simulations revealed that, in the presence of aberrant musculoskeletal geometries, altered muscle-tendon properties rather than reduced neuromuscular control complexity and spasticity were the primary cause of the crouch gait pattern observed for this child, which is in agreement with the clinical examination. These results suggest that muscle-tendon properties should be the primary target of interventions aiming to restore an upright gait pattern for this child. This suggestion is in line with the gait analysis following muscle-tendon property and bone deformity corrections. Future work should extend this single case analysis to more patients in order to validate the ability of our physics-based simulations to capture the gait patterns of individual patients pre- and post-treatment. Such validation would open the door for identifying targeted treatment strategies with the aim of designing optimized interventions for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders.

J	von Luehmann, Alexander; Ortega-Martinez, Antonio; Boas, David A.; Yucel, Meryem Ayse								Using the General Linear Model to Improve Performance in fNIRS Single Trial Analysis and Classification: A Perspective								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						30	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00030			FEB 18 2020	2020	Within a decade, single trial analysis of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals has gained significant momentum, and fNIRS joined the set of modalities frequently used for active and passive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). A great variety of methods for feature extraction and classification have been explored using state-of-the-art Machine Learning methods. In contrast, signal preprocessing and cleaning pipelines for fNIRS often follow simple recipes and so far rarely incorporate the available state-of-the-art in adjacent fields. In neuroscience, where fMRI and fNIRS are established neuroimaging tools, evoked hemodynamic brain activity is typically estimated across multiple trials using a General Linear Model (GLM). With the help of the GLM, subject, channel, and task specific evoked hemodynamic responses are estimated, and the evoked brain activity is more robustly separated from systemic physiological interference using independent measures of nuisance regressors, such as short-separation fNIRS measurements. When correctly applied in single trial analysis, e.g., in BCI, this approach can significantly enhance contrast to noise ratio of the brain signal, improve feature separability and ultimately lead to better classification accuracy. In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction into the GLM and show how to incorporate it into a typical BCI preprocessing pipeline and cross-validation. Using a resting state fNIRS data set augmented with synthetic hemodynamic responses that provide ground truth brain activity, we compare the quality of commonly used fNIRS features for BCI that are extracted from (1) conventionally preprocessed signals, and (2) signals preprocessed with the GLM and physiological nuisance regressors. We show that the GLM-based approach can provide better single trial estimates of brain activity as well as a new feature type, i.e., the weight of the individual and channel-specific hemodynamic response function (HRF) regressor. The improved estimates yield features with higher separability, that significantly enhance accuracy in a binary classification task when compared to conventional preprocessing-on average +7.4% across subjects and feature types. We propose to adapt this well-established approach from neuroscience to the domain of single-trial analysis and preprocessing wherever the classification of evoked brain activity is of concern, for instance in BCI.

Thus, Neurofeedback (NF) or Brain-Computer-Interface applications for stroke rehabilitation purposes are gaining increased attention. Indeed, NF has the potential to enhance volitional control of targeted cortical areas and thus impact on motor function recovery. However, current implementations are limited by temporal, spatial or practical constraints of the specific imaging modality used. In this pilot work and for the first time in literature, we applied bimodal EEG-fMRI NF for upper limb stroke recovery on four stroke-patients with different stroke characteristics and motor impairment severity. We also propose a novel, multi-target training approach that guides the training towards the activation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex. In addition to fMRI and EEG outcomes, we assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) with tractography. Preliminary results suggest the feasibility of our approach and show its potential to induce an augmented activation of ipsilesional motor areas, depending on the severity of the stroke deficit. Only the two patients with a preserved CST and subcortical lesions succeeded in upregulating the ipsilesional primary motor cortex and exhibited a functional improvement of upper limb motricity. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account the variability of the stroke patients' population and enabled to identify inclusion criteria for the design of future clinical studies.

Objectives: To qualitatively examine the overlapping nature of these behaviors among PWID in the US Northeast. Methods: We recruited HIV-uninfected PWID and key informants through community-based organizations. Qualitative interviews explored sexual partnerships as they related to sharing contaminated needles and injection equipment, engaging in condomless sex, and associated indications for PrEP among PWID. Results: Among 33 PWID, 66% engaged in condomless vaginal or anal sex in the past 3 months, and 27% had three or more sexual partners in this same time period. Over half engaged in any past month distributive or receptive syringe sharing (64%). We identified three contexts through which overlapping sexual and injection-related HIV risks emerged, including (1) multiple concurrent sexual partnerships; (2) using and injecting drugs with sexual partners (including increase injecting of crystal methamphetamine); and (3) exchanging sex for money or drugs (including among male PWID). Condom use was inconsistent across these contexts. Limited interactions with healthcare providers often resulted in sexual risks being overlooked in light of competing health concerns. Conclusions: Sexual risk for HIV acquisition is complex and multi-faceted among PWID yet may be overlooked by prevention and healthcare providers. Comprehensive HIV prevention efforts must acknowledge the distinct contexts in which overlapping injection and sexual risk behaviors occur. Increased sexual health screening and risk reduction services including PrEP for PWID may help curtail transmission in this population.

Despite growing concerns, there exists a research-to-practice gap in the implementation of evidence-based treatment strategies, particularly in the area of physical activity as a low-cost adjunct to treatment programs. Additionally, people with SUD often face challenges in re-entering the workforce, due to multiple factors including long absences, incarceration, or lack of experience and training. Method: Our group conducted focus group interviews with 26 participants to evaluate a 12-week fitness and health education program (Live Fitness) using grounded theory methodology. Live Fitness also served as a vocational training opportunity in collaboration with a large fitness facility and a residential SUD treatment program. Results: Three broad categories emerged from the focus group interviews: The program serves as an aide for recovery, confers physical benefits from participation, and helps participants feel that they are part of the community with a way to ease back into life. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that treatment centers should invest attention and resources into guided fitness programs and that programs with an emphasis in vocational training should continue to be explored.

Modulating Brain Networks With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Over the Primary Motor Cortex: A Concurrent TMS/fMRI Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						31	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00031			FEB 14 2020	2020	Stimulating the primary motor cortex (M1) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) causes unique multisensory experience such as the targeted muscle activity, afferent/reafferent sensory feedback, tactile sensation over the scalp and "click" sound. Although the human M1 has been intensively investigated using TMS, the experience of the M1 stimulation has not been elucidated at the whole brain. Here, using concurrent TMS/fMRI, we investigated the acute effect of the M1 stimulation of functional brain networks during task and at rest. A short train of 1 Hz TMS pulses applied to individuals' hand area in the M1 during motor execution or at rest. Employing the independent component analysis (ICA), we showed the M1 stimulation decreased the motor networks activity when the networks were engaged in the task and increased the deactivation of networks when the networks were not involved in the ongoing task. The M1 stimulation induced the activation in the key networks involved in bodily self-consciousness (BSC) including the insular and rolandic operculum systems regardless of states. The degree of activation in these networks was prominent at rest compared to task conditions, showing the state-dependent TMS effect. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the M1 stimulation modulated other domain-general networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and attention network and the inter-network connectivity between these networks. Our results showed that the M1 stimulation induced the widespread changes in the brain at the targeted system as well as non-motor, remote brain networks, specifically related to the BSC. Our findings shed light on understanding the neural mechanism of the complex and multisensory experience of the M1 stimulation.

While age-related gradual changes in steroid hormones such as testosterone, estradiol, or cortisol are well described in men, their interactions among each other or with genetic markers have not been sufficiently investigated with regard to physical health or psychological well-being. More specifically, the examination of age-related alterations in hormone interactions and the androgen receptor polymorphism, which modulates androgen action on target cells, in relation to physical health and psychological well-being represents a promising avenue for research on healthy aging in men. A total of 97 healthy aging men provided complete data on psychometric health measures as well as hormonal and genetic parameters at baseline and a 4-year follow-up assessment. Fasting saliva samples were taken at 8:00 am under standardized laboratory conditions, while the androgen receptor gene polymorphism was analyzed from dried blood spots. Longitudinal analyses revealed that psychological well-being and physical health remained stable over time. Analyses indicated that E2 moderated the course of psychological well-being, while the androgen receptor gene polymorphism moderated the course of physical health. Further, T was a strong predictor of physical health. These results suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis might be important for the maintenance of psychological well-being in men, while physical health depends more on interindividual differences in the androgen receptor gene and T.

Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy Utilize More Cortical Resources for Similar Motor Output During Treadmill Gait								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						36	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00036			FEB 14 2020	2020	Children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) walk independently although with an asymmetrical, more poorly coordinated pattern compared to their peers. While gait biomechanics in unilateral CP and their alteration from those without CP have been well documented, cortical mechanisms underlying gait remain inadequately understood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) during treadmill gait in older children with and without CP. Lower limb surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected and muscle synergy analyses performed to quantify motor output. Our primary goal was to evaluate the relationships between cortical and muscle activation within and across groups and hemispheres to provide novel insights into neural control of gait and how it may be disrupted by an early unilateral brain injury. Participants included 9 children with unilateral CP, mean age 16.0 +/- 2.7 years, and 12 with typical development (TD), mean age 14.8 +/- 3.0 years. EEG data were collected during a standing baseline and treadmill walking at self-selected speed. EMG of 16 lower limb muscles were also collected bilaterally and synchronized with EEG. No significant group differences were found in synergy number or structure across groups. Six cortical clusters were identified as having gait-related activation and all contained participants from both CP and TD groups; however, the percent of individuals per group appearing in different clusters varied. Notably, the cluster least represented in CP was the non-dominant motor region. Both groups showed mu-band ERD in the motor clusters during gait although sustained beta-band ERD was not evident in TD. The CP group showed greater cortical activation than TD during walking as measured by mu- and beta-ERD in the dominant and non-dominant motor and parietal regions and elevated low gamma-activity in the frontal and parietal areas, a unique finding in CP. CP showed greater bilateral motor EEG-EMG coherence in the gamma-band with the hallucis longus compared to TD. In summary, individuals with CP display increased cortical activation during gait possibly relating to differences in distal motor control of the more affected side. Strategies that iteratively reduce cortical activation while improving selective motor control are needed in CP.

To inspect the alterations in brain activation and functional connectivity for children with DS, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) method was applied to examine the brain activation difference in the motor and prefrontal cortex between the DS and typically developing (TD) groups during a fine motor task. In addition, small-world analysis based on graph theory was also carried out to characterize the topological organization of functional brain networks. Interestingly, behavior data demonstrated that the DS group showed significantly long reaction time and low accuracy as compared to the TD group (p < 0.05). More importantly, significantly reduced brain activations in the frontopolar area, the pre-motor, and the supplementary motor cortex (p < 0.05) were identified in the DS group compared with the TD group. Meanwhile, significantly high global efficiency (E-g) and short average path length (L-p) were also detected for the DS group. This pilot study illustrated that the disrupted connectivity of frontopolar area, pre-motor, and supplementary motor cortex might be one of the core mechanisms associated with motor and cognitive impairments for children with DS. Therefore, the combination of the fNIRS technique with functional network analysis may pave a new avenue for improving our understanding of the neural mechanisms of DS.

Goal Management Training (GMT) is a cognitive rehabilitation intervention for improving executive function (EF) that has received empirical support in studies of adults with SB and ABI. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a newly developed pediatric GMT protocol (pGMT). Thirteen children (7 boys, 10-16 years) with SB (n = 4), traumatic brain injury (n = 8), and encephalitis (n = 1) were included, based upon the presence of EF problems as described by parents. The participants received 21 h of pGMT, using inpatient intervention periods, followed by 4 h of pGMT outpatient guidance over 8 weeks. Notably, pGMT was found to be both feasible and acceptable, with satisfactory compliance for the children, parents and teachers, in addition to being considered acceptable by all participants. Furthermore, a reliable change in daily life EF was reported by the parents for 2 children. And, some children obtained scores below clinical cut-off on a measure of parent reported real-life EF after intervention. Hence, findings suggest that a randomized controlled trial of pGMT, with a larger sample size, should be conducted.

However, the setup of BCI systems is complex and may be divided into (1) mounting the headset and (2) calibration of the BCI. One of the major problems is mounting the headset for recording brain activity in a stroke rehabilitation context, and usability testing of this is limited. In this study, the aim was to compare the translational aspects of mounting five different commercially available headsets from a user perspective and investigate the design considerations associated with technology transfer to rehabilitation clinics and home use. No EEG signals were recorded, so the effectiveness of the systems have not been evaluated. Three out of five headsets covered the motor cortex which is needed to pick up movement intentions of attempted movements. The other two were as control and reference for potential design considerations. As primary stakeholders, nine stroke patients, eight therapists and two relatives participated; the stroke patients mounted the headsets themselves. The setup time was recorded, and participants filled in questionnaires related to comfort, aesthetics, setup complexity, overall satisfaction, and general design considerations. The patients had difficulties in mounting all headsets except for a headband with a dry electrode located on the forehead (control). The therapists and relatives were able to mount all headsets. The fastest headset to mount was the headband, and the most preferred headsets were the headband and a behind-ear headset (control). The most preferred headset that covered the motor cortex used water-based electrodes. The patients reported that it was important that they could mount the headset themselves for them to use it every day at home. These results have implications for design considerations for the development of BCI systems to be used in rehabilitation clinics and in the patient's home.

Cerebellum, Basal Ganglia, and Cortex Mediate Performance of an Aerial Pursuit Task								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						29	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00029			FEB 14 2020	2020	The affordance competition hypothesis is an ethologically inspired theory from cognitive neuroscience that provides an integrative neural account of continuous, real-time behavior, and will likely become increasingly relevant to the growing field of neuroergonomics. In the spirit of neuroergonomics in aviation, we designed a three-dimensional, first-person, continuous, and real-time fMRI task during which human subjects maneuvered a simulated airplane in pursuit of a target airplane along constantly changing headings. We introduce a pseudo-event-related, parametric fMRI analysis approach to begin testing the affordance competition hypothesis in neuroergonomic contexts, and attempt to identify regions of the brain that exhibit a linear metabolic relationship with the continuous variables of task performance and distance-from-target. In line with the affordance competition hypothesis, our results implicate the cooperation of the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cortex in such a task, with greater involvement of the basal ganglia during good performance, and greater involvement of cortex and cerebellum during poor performance and when distance-from-target closes. We briefly review the somatic marker and dysmetria of thought hypotheses, in addition to the affordance competition hypothesis, to speculate on the intricacies of the cooperation of these brain regions in a task such as ours. In doing so, we demonstrate how the affordance competition hypothesis and other cognitive neuroscience theories are ready for testing in continuous, real-time tasks such as ours, and in other neuroergonomic settings more generally.

What remains unknown is how longitudinal changes in these components of empathy predict adolescent substance using behavior. Methods: This secondary data analysis used data that followed adolescents in outpatient treatment for substance use (n = 826) during treatment and at 6 months post-treatment. To examine cross-lagged effects of empathy on substance use over time, we used a latent basis growth curve model. Results: Increases in affective empathy predicted reduced substance use over time. However, cognitive empathy did not predict substance use after controlling for other covariates. Conclusions: Lower levels of affective empathy may indicate a developmental vulnerability for substance using behavior. Modifying affective empathy may be a viable treatment target for reducing adolescent substance use.

Studies focusing on performance-enhancing substances (PES) use among gym users are few and mostly concern the practice of bodybuilding and the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), without providing information about social indicators to further explore why this specific population use these substances. Objectives: To investigate the extent of PES use and examine the way social indicators, exercise profile and gym modalities influence the use of these substances among a sample of gym users. Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study, among a convenience sample of 453 Portuguese gym users, recruited directly by five institutional gyms ' email and Facebook. Data were collected via a structured web-based survey, between October and November 2017. Multiple binary logistic regression, the Chi-Square test or Monte Carlo Simulation or Fisher's Exact test were used. The odds ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 11,1% of gym users reported the use of prohibited PES, which varies significantly according to gender, education, exercise profile and type of practice. Gender was associated with the class of PES used. Polypharmacy was a common practice among users, increasing the risk of side-effects. Peer effect and media appear to be strikingly important in the misuse of PES. Conclusion: Results provide precise insight into the specific factors associated with PES use, which could support prevention strategies in gym/fitness context.

The former is an indigenous theory, and the latter is a cross-cultural theory. In order to verify the relationship between two different personality traits from theory and neuropsychology, the current study recruited 170 healthy adults to calculate their five-Pattern Personality Inventory (FPPI) and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ) scales and to scan their brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, we performed stepwise-regression analysis and mediation-effect analysis to explore the association between brain regional homogeneity (ReHo) and two types of personality traits. The results showed that the ReHo of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) positively correlated with TaiYang traits for FPPI and that there was a significant linear relationship with extraversion and neuroticism for EPQ. Besides, the ReHo of the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) positively correlated with TaiYin for FPPI, and it also showed a significant linear relationship with neuroticism for EPQ. Furthermore, we found that extroversion and neuroticism partially mediated the relationship between five-pattern personality traits and the regional brain function, based on the mediation-effect analysis. Our findings suggest that Chinese five-pattern personality traits have a close relationship with Eysenck's personality traits and that both may be engaged in similar neurobiological mechanisms in common brain regions to some extent. Hence, these findings first reveal a relationship between Chinese traditional personality traits and Western Eysenck's personality traits in terms of both theoretical and neurobiological contexts.

Methods: Twenty-one retired rugby players (47.7 +/- 12.9 year old; age at retirement: 38.5 +/- 8.9 year; number of years playing rugby: 12.7 +/- 3.7 year) with a history of three or more diagnosed concussions (8.9 +/- 7.9 concussions per player) and 23 controls with no history of mTBI (46.5 +/- 12.8 year old) performed a NVC test to detect task-orientated cerebral hemodynamic changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results: The NVC showed a statistically significant reduction in the cerebral hemodynamic response in comparison to the control group which had a greater relative increase of oxyhemoglobin (O(2)Hb). There were reductions in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) O(2)Hb (-0.015 +/- 0.258 mu M) and relative increases in deoxyhemoglobin (HHb; -0.004 +/- 0.159 mu M) in the same region for the mTBI group in comparison to the control group (-0.160 +/- 0.311 mu M; -0.121 +/- 0.076 mu M for O(2)Hb and HHb, respectively). The mTBI group induced a greater rate of oxygen extraction compared to the control group. Conclusion: This was the first study to examine cerebral hemodynamic changes in retired rugby players in response to a NVC test, and we found reduced cerebral hemodynamic responses in participants with a history of mTBI compared to controls. These results suggest altered cerebral metabolic demands in participants with a history of multiple head injuries. Further research is needed to ascertain an understanding of the changes in hemodynamics from playing into retirement.

Pre-frontal Cortex Oxygenation Changes During Aerobic Exercise in Elite Athletes Experiencing Sport-Related Concussion								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						35	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00035			FEB 12 2020	2020	Aims: Recent research suggests that aerobic exercise can be performed safely within the first week following a concussion injury and that early initiation of exercise may speed recovery. To better understand the physiological changes during a concussion, we tested the hypothesis that mild-to-intense exercise testing can be performed within days immediately following injury, and can be used to discern differences between the concussed and normal healthy state. Thus, the purpose was to observe the cerebral hemodynamic responses to incremental exercise testing performed acutely post-concussion in high-performance athletes. Methods: This study was a within- and between-experimental design, with seven male university ice hockey teams participating. A subgroup of five players acted as control subjects (CON) and was tested at the same time as the 14 concussed (mTBI) players on Day 2, 4, and 7 post-concussion. A 5-min resting baseline and 5-min exercise bouts of mild (EX1), moderate (EX2), and high (EX3) intensity exercise were performed on a cycle ergometer. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor pre-frontal cortex oxy-haemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb), and total blood volume (tHb) changes. Results: ANOVA compared differences between testing days and groups, and although large percentage changes in HbO(2) (20-30%), HHb (30-40%), and tHb (30-40%) were recorded, no significant (p <= 0.05) differences in cerebral hemodynamics occurred between mTBI vs. CON during aerobic exercise testing on any day post-injury. Furthermore, there was a linear relationship between exercise intensity vs. cerebral hemodynamics during testing for each day (r(2) = 0.83-0.99). Conclusion: These results demonstrate two novel findings: (1) mild-to-intense aerobic exercise testing can be performed safely as early as Day 2 post-concussion injury in a controlled laboratory environment; and (2) evidence-based objective measures such as cerebral hemodynamics can easily be collected using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor physiological changes during the first-week post-injury. This research has important implications for monitoring physiological recovery post-injury and establishing new rehabilitation guidelines.		[Neary, J.

Despite the robustness of this finding in Western populations, its generalizability to other cultural contexts is largely unknown. In this study, we examined whether the regular use of alcohol or marijuana use relates to impaired executive functioning in male students of a Nigerian university. Methods: Chronic alcohol users (n = 39), chronic marijuana users (n = 35) and drug-abstinent control participants (n = 40) recruited through snow-ball sampling technique completed a computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (cWCST). As an established measure of executive functioning, the cWCST allows for the simultaneous assessment of three distinct executive processes: set shifting, rule inference, and set maintenance. Results revealed a selective set-shifting deficit in both alcohol and marijuana users. Results: Both groups committed significantly more perseverative errors than the control group, and group differences were significantly stronger on this indicator of set shifting than on indicators of rule inference or set maintenance. Conclusions: Our findings support the generalizability of drug-related deficits in executive functioning and contribute to the characterization of executive dysfunction in non-Western populations. Future longitudinal studies are required to clarify whether executive dysfunction is an antecedent or consequence of alcohol and marijuana use in young Nigerians.

Our aim was to study how these processes affected hand actions in chronic stroke patients, based on whether they had limb apraxia. Twenty-two left hemisphere, chronic stroke patients were measured on neuropsychological tasks of limb apraxia, which was identified in a subgroup of 10 patients. All patients underwent testing on a separate task of making simple reach and grasp actions to a cup. Their performance was compared to a group of 18 healthy age-matched volunteers. Participants were instructed to grasp the top or bottom of a cup to either lift or turn it over so as to end with a hand position that was either comfortable or uncomfortable. This task tested the influence of the compatibility of hand-cup orientation, as well as goals driven by the end-state comfort of the hand, on action selection for object manipulation. Participants' performance was measured in terms of error rates, and speed of initiation and reaching (movement time) to the object. The patients' performance was significantly delayed, and error rates increased when reaching to grasp a cup under conditions of poor compatibility and end-state comfort. The subgroup of patients with apraxia showed a decreased influence of compatibility of hand interaction with the cup, with increased error rates and delayed response times, compared to patients with no apraxia and healthy volunteers. This is despite the fact they did not display significant deficits on neuropsychological tasks of real object use. The study shows that patients with apraxia have difficulties in selecting elements of object-directed actions, pertaining to both habitual and goal-directed factors.

Available data have been inconsistent and mostly short-term regarding the effect of both brain targets on gait and axial symptoms. We aimed to identify potential target specific differences at 3-year follow-up from a large single-center experience. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed short-term (6-month follow-up) and long-term (36-month follow-up) changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II and III total scores of 72 PD patients (53 with bilateral STN-DBS and 19 with bilateral GPi-DBS). An interdisciplinary team made target-specific decisions for each DBS patient. We analyzed changes in gait and axial subscores derived from UPDRS II and III. Results: In both the STN- and GPi-DBS cohorts, we observed no significant differences in gait and axial UPDRS derived subscores in the off-med/on stimulation state at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline. On-med axial scores remained similar in the short-term but worsened in both groups (STN, 2.23 +/- 3.43, p < 0.001; GPi, 2.53 +/- 2.37, p < 0.01) in the long-term possibly due to disease progression. At long-term follow-up, the UPDRS III off-med/on stimulation scores worsened but were persistently improved from baseline in both groups (-9.07 +/- 13.9, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The study showed that long-term both STN- and GPi-DBS had a similar effect on gait and axial symptoms in UPDRS derived subscores at 36-month follow-up despite potential baseline differences in criteria for selection of each target. More sophisticated measures of gait and balance beyond the categorical UPDRS score will be needed for future studies.

Stimuli were 200 infant faces displaying Happiness, Relaxation, Sadness, Distress and 32 piano musical pieces conveying the same emotional states (as specifically assessed). Music and faces were presented simultaneously, and paired so that in half cases they were emotionally congruent or incongruent. Twenty subjects were told to pay attention and respond to infrequent targets (adult neutral faces) while their EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The face-related N170 (160-180 ms) component was the earliest response affected by the emotional content of faces (particularly by distress), while visual P300 (250-450 ms) and auditory N400 (350-550 ms) responses were specifically modulated by the emotional content of both facial expressions and musical pieces. Face/music emotional incongruence elicited a wide N400 negativity indicating the detection of a mismatch in the expressed emotion. A swLORETA inverse solution applied to N400 (difference wave Incong. - Cong.), showed the crucial role of Inferior and Superior Temporal Gyri in the multimodal representation of emotional information extracted from faces and music. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (superior and medial, BA 10) was also strongly active, possibly supporting working memory. The data hints at a common system for representing emotional information derived by social cognition and music processing, including uncus and cuneus.

Effects of Anodal tDCS on Arithmetic Performance and Electrophysiological Activity								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						17	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00017			FEB 11 2020	2020	Arithmetic abilities are among the most important school-taught skills and form the basis for higher mathematical competencies. At the same time, their acquisition and application can be challenging. Hence, there is broad interest in methods to improve arithmetic abilities. One promising method is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the present study, we compared two anodal tDCS protocols in their efficacy to improve arithmetic performance and working memory. In addition, we investigated stimulation-related electrophysiological changes. Three groups of participants solved arithmetic problems (additions and subtractions) and an n-back task before, during, and after receiving either frontal or parietal anodal tDCS (25 min; 1 mA) or sham stimulation. EEG was simultaneously recorded to assess stimulation effects on event-related (de-) synchronisation (ERS/ERD) in theta and alpha bands. Persons receiving frontal stimulation showed an acceleration of calculation speed in large subtractions from before to during and after stimulation. However, a comparable, but delayed (apparent only after stimulation) increase was also found in the sham stimulation group, while it was absent in the group receiving parietal stimulation. In additions and small subtractions as well as the working memory task, analyses showed no effects of stimulation. Results of ERS/ERD during large subtractions indicate changes in ERS/ERD patterns over time. In the left hemisphere there was a change from theta band ERD to ERS in all three groups, whereas a similar change in the right hemisphere was restricted to the sham group. Taken together, tDCS did not lead to a general improvement of arithmetic performance. However, results indicate that frontal stimulation accelerated training gains, while parietal stimulation halted them. The absence of general performance improvements, but acceleration of training effects might be a further indicator of the advantages of using tDCS as training or learning support over tDCS as a sole performance enhancer.

However, most research has been conducted with small sample sizes using experimental protocols that lack established psychometric properties. We examined the attention performance of 114 individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia using a standardised, norm-referenced assessment of attention, the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II (CPT-II; Conners, C. K. (2000). Conners' Continuous Performance Test II. Toronto: Multi-Health Systems Inc). Participants completed the CPT-II and the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R; Kertesz, A. (2007). Western Aphasia Battery-Revised. San Antonio, TX: PsychCorp). As a group, variable performance on selected CPT-II measures was observed. Participants demonstrated impairments on omissions (48.2%) and hit reaction time (67.5%), with 11.4% demonstrating atypically slow performance and over half of the sample (56.1%) performing atypically fast. The Confidence Index, a summary score, was also within the impaired range for the majority of participants. However, there were also measures in which a greater percentage of participants demonstrated performance within normal limits. Using the WAB-R Aphasia Quotient (AQ) as a measure of severity, there was significantly worse performance in participants with more severe (AQ < 50) compared to less severe (AQ >= 50) aphasia. No significant differences in attention were identified between participants with fluent versus non-fluent aphasia. The CPT-II is a feasible measure for persons with aphasia, which may assist in identifying attention performance deficits that potentially affect language.

Research also suggests that masculine identity impacts on how people manage their health experiences. The current study aimed to explore the experience of masculine identity following TBI. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 men aged 21-67 years who had experienced a TBI. All were living in the community. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to consider lived experiences and to explore the meaning of the TBI experience in relation to masculine identity. Three superordinate themes emerged from the analysis: doing life and relationships differently, self-perceptions and the perceived view of others, and managing the impact of TBI as a man. These themes are considered in relation to how participants' experiences interacted with dominant social ideals of masculine identity. The findings highlighted how masculine identity may be a valuable aspect of self in considering threats to and reconstruction of self-identity after TBI. Aspects of gender identity should be considered in order to promote engagement, support adjustment and achieve meaningful outcomes in rehabilitation.

The aim of this study was to describe a new approach for assessing executive functions in everyday life and its unique expression in adolescents with Genetic Generalised Epilepsies (GGEs) compared with typical peers. Twenty adolescents with a diagnosis of GGEs and 20 typical healthy peers, matched by age and gender, were studied. Assessment of everyday executive function was carried out using: (1) the Weekly Calendar Planning Activity (WCPA), a direct performance based and outcome measure of strategy use and cognitive performance; and (2) Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) parental report. Adolescents with GGEs demonstrated significantly less accuracy, less efficiency and fewer strategies used, as measured by the WCPA. Parents of adolescents with GGEs rated their child's daily performance as less efficient compared with typical peers. Better ratings of executive function (low BRIEF score) were associated with greater WCPA accuracy in the entered appointments. The WCPA provides a useful evaluation of cognitive performance for adolescents with GGEs and a functionally relevant information on task efficiency, self-monitoring and effective strategy use. Direct observation of performance supplements parental ratings and has strong potential to guide intervention and measure outcomes.

Self-concept changes remain understudied in the early stages of inpatient rehabilitation. The aim of the current study was to examine changes in self-concept, distress, wellbeing and functional skills for five inpatients undertaking a music therapy intervention within a subacute rehabilitation centre in Victoria, Australia. Participants completed a six-week, 12-session therapeutic songwriting programme to produce past-, current- and future-self-focused songs. A range of self-concept, subjective wellbeing and distress measures were completed pre-, mid- and post-intervention. A descriptive case series approach was applied to determine trends in pre-post scores for five individual cases. Participants showing the greatest gains across self-concept and subjective wellbeing indices also showed the greatest functional gains on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) from admission to discharge. The current study highlights the importance of examining early changes in self-concept, wellbeing and distress in subacute rehabilitation, and suggests that individualised songwriting programmes warrant further research attention in neurological populations.

The aim of this study is to clarify whether individuals with visuospatial defects can use electronic devices effectively. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the ability of seven individuals with Balint syndrome and seven individuals with left-unilateral spatial neglect (USN) to input a digit sequence into a flat touch interface. Control groups consisted of seven individuals with memory deficits and 11 healthy individuals. Participants with Balint syndrome took longer and had more hesitations than the USN group and the two control groups to input numerical sequences (Steel-Dwass test, p < .01). In addition, participants with Balint syndrome had a high percentage of hesitations for exploration of the button array on the interface relative to USN and the memory deficit group (Fisher's exact test, p < .05). Regarding neuropsychological data, participants with Balint syndrome had a lower score for visuospatial working memory than participants with USN and the memory deficits control group (Steel-Dwass test, p < .01). The results shed some light on the relation between visuospatial working memory deficits and the spatial perception of interface layouts and spatial control during electronic device operation.

This study is part of a prospective national study on sTBI conducted in all four Norwegian Trauma Referral Centres, including patients aged >15 years over a period of three years (n = 378). For the purpose of this study, only pre-employed individuals of working age (16 to 67 years) were investigated for RTW (n = 143), and of these, 104 participants underwent neuropsychological testing. Measures of acute injury severity, neuropsychological composite scores (Memory, Processing Speed, Executive Functions) at the one-year follow-up, and the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (patient- and relative reports) were explored as predictors of RTW. The frequency of RTW was 54.5%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified younger age, shorter length of stay in intensive care, better Processing Speed scores, and lower levels of metacognitive difficulties as rated by relatives as significant predictors of RTW. Findings support the importance of neuropsychological measures in predicting long-term RTW and highlight the need to address neurocognitive and behavioural difficulties to improve RTW after sTBI.

To elucidate the contribution of some neuroanatomical and behavioural factors to PA's effectiveness, we conducted a study combining neuropsychological and lesion mapping methods on a group of 19 neglect patients who underwent two sessions of PA during one week and assessed their improvement relative to the baseline until the following week (7-8 days later). Correlation analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between the magnitude of the proprioceptive after-effect and the improvement at the follow-up session in two perceptual tasks requiring motor responses. Conversely, no correlation was found between the proprioceptive after-effect and the improvement in a perceptual task with no motor involvement. This finding suggests that patients' potential to show a prism-related improvement in motor-related tasks might be indicated by the strength of their proprioceptive response (proprioceptive after-effect). As for the neuroanatomical basis of this relationship, subtraction analyses suggested that patients' improvement in perceptual tasks with high motor involvement might be facilitated by the integrity of temporo-parietal areas and the damage of frontal and subcortical areas.

Although both parents' and children's ER neurocircuitry simultaneously affect how they interact with one another, neuroimaging studies of parent-child relationships typically include only one member of the dyad in brain imaging procedures. The current study examined brain activation related to parenting and ER in parent-adolescent dyads during concurrent fMRI scanning with a novel task - the Testing Emotional Attunement and Mutuality (TEAM) task. The TEAM task includes feedback trials indicating the other dyad member made an error, resulting in a monetary loss for both participants. Results indicate that positive parenting practices as reported by the adolescent were positively correlated with parents' hemodynamic activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region related to empathy, during these error trials. Additionally, during feedback conditions both parents and adolescents exhibited fMRI activation in ER-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule. Adolescents had higher left amygdala activation than parents during the feedback condition. These findings demonstrate the utility of dyadic fMRI scanning for investigating relational processes, particularly in the parent-child relationship.

The Effect of Visual Articulatory Information on the Neural Correlates of Non-native Speech Sound Discrimination								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						25	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00025			FEB 7 2020	2020	Behavioral studies have shown that the ability to discriminate between non-native speech sounds improves after seeing how the sounds are articulated. This study examined the influence of visual articulatory information on the neural correlates of non-native speech sound discrimination. English speakers' discrimination of the Hindi dental and retroflex sounds was measured using the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential, before and after they completed one of three 8-min training conditions. In an audio-visual speech training condition (n = 14), each sound was presented with its corresponding visual articulation. In one control condition (n = 14), both sounds were presented with the same visual articulation, resulting in one congruent and one incongruent audio-visual pairing. In another control condition (n = 14), both sounds were presented with the same image of a still face. The control conditions aimed to rule out the possibility that the MMN is influenced by non-specific audio-visual pairings, or by general exposure to the dental and retroflex sounds over the course of the study. The results showed that audio-visual speech training reduced the latency of the MMN but did not affect MMN amplitude. No change in MMN amplitude or latency was observed for the two control conditions. The pattern of results suggests that a relatively short audio-visual speech training session (i.e., 8 min) may increase the speed with which the brain processes non-native speech sound contrasts. The absence of a training effect on MMN amplitude suggests a single session of audio-visual speech training does not lead to the formation of more discrete memory traces for non-native speech sounds. Longer and/or multiple sessions might be needed to influence the MMN amplitude.		[Plumridge, James M.

Participants (N = 70) included both combat and non-combat active duty military personnel and veterans who sustained either a severe traumatic brain injury, or anoxic brain injury and were considered to have a disorder of consciousness at the time of admission. Patient information was retrospectively collected from electronic medical records from one of the VA polytrauma rehabilitation centre sites. Receiver Operator Characteristic models were utilised to explore "cut-off scores" for predicting emergence using the CRS-R. Results showed that week-three scores on the CRS-R were more accurate in determining whether a veteran would emerge from a disorder of consciousness. Limitations, including a limited sample size are explored, along with implications and recommendations for future research and clinical practice.

Utilising a qualitative approach, this study explored family experiences of the Heads Together Camp (HTC) from the perspective of parents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 parents who had attended the camp. Thematic analysis identified six themes: ABI and the family; Apprehension and discomfort; Connections and community; Hope and perspective; Fun, relaxation and respite; and Family functioning. Families experienced initial feelings of apprehension at camp, which attenuated as connections developed between camp attendees. These connections were grounded in shared experiences of ABI and enabled families to become part of an accepting community, feel less alone and share information. The camp environment also facilitated fun and relaxation, provided families with hope and perspective, and led to improvements in family relationships. Overall, recreational camps may mitigate some stressors experienced by families affected by ABI.

Visual perceptual abilities (VPAs) are essential in activities involving mobility. However, whether and to what extent post-stroke USN affects VPAs and how they contribute to mobility impairments remains unclear. Objectives: To estimate the extent to which VPAs in left and right visual hemispaces are (1) affected in post-stroke USN; and (2) contribute to goal-directed locomotion. Methods: Individuals with (USN+, n = 15) and without (USN-, n = 15) post-stroke USN and healthy controls (HC, n = 15) completed (1) psychophysical evaluation of contrast sensitivity, optic flow direction and coherence, and shape discrimination; and (2) goal-directed locomotion tasks. Results: Higher discrimination thresholds were found for all VPAs in the USN+ group compared to USN- and HC groups (p < 0.05). Psychophysical tests showed high sensitivity in detecting deficits in individuals with a history of USN or with no USN on traditional assessments, and were found to be significantly correlated with goal-directed locomotor impairments. Conclusion: Deficits in VPAs may account for the functional difficulties experienced by individuals with post-stroke USN. Psychophysical tests used in the present study offer important advantages and can be implemented to enhance USN diagnostics and rehabilitation.

This study evaluated virtual reality (VR) as an intervention tool for enhancing cognitive and vocational outcomes in 90 young ketamine users (KU) randomly assigned to a treatment group (virtual reality group, VRG; tutor-administered group, TAG) or wait-listed control group (CG). Two training programmes with similar content but different delivery modes (VR-based and manual-based) were applied using a virtual boutique as a training scenario. Outcome assessments comprised the Digit Vigilance Test, Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Wisconsin Cart Sorting Test, work-site test and self-efficacy pre- and post-test and during 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The VRG exhibited significant improvements in attention and improvements in memory that were maintained after 3 months. Both the VRG and TAG exhibited significantly improved vocational skills after training which were maintained during follow-up, and improved self-efficacy. VR-based cognitive training might target cognitive problems in KU.		[Man, David W. K.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Rehabil Sci, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Man, David W.

However, little is known about the differences between those with OUD who do and do not smoke cigarettes. Objectives: Our aim was to investigate differences between treatment-seeking adults with OUD who did and did not smoke. Methods: Participants (N = 568; 30% female) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires including measures of current smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per day as well as measures of clinical characteristics (e.g. craving, anxiety). Results: Of the total sample, 77% were current smokers. Multivariable logistic regression identified heroin use (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.38, 3.53) and younger age (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95, 0.997) as strong correlates of smoking status; other characteristics were not significant. Older age and opioid craving were associated with more cigarettes smoked per day. Notably, these patterns differed for males and females; opioid craving (B = 0.62, SEB = 0.24) was associated with the number of cigarettes smoked among men, and anxiety (B = 0.39, SEB = 0.19) was associated with the number of cigarettes smoked among women. Conclusion: Adults with OUD who used heroin in the past month were more likely to be current smokers. No sex differences were observed in likelihood of smoking; however, the predictors of smoking status and severity differed between men and women.		[McHugh, R.

However, the neural processes that underlie these live interactive behaviors and eye-to-eye contact are not well understood. The Dynamic Neural Coupling Hypothesis presents a general theoretical framework proposing that shared interactive behaviors are represented by cross-brain signal coherence. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) adapted for hyper scanning, we tested this hypothesis specifically for neural mechanisms associated with eye-to-eye gaze between human participants compared to similar direct eye-gaze at a dynamic video of a face and predicted that the coherence of neural signals between the two participants during reciprocal eye-to-eye contact would be greater than coherence observed during direct eye-gaze at a dynamic video for those signals originating in social and face processing systems. Consistent with this prediction cross-brain coherence was increased for signals within the angular gyrus (AG) during eye-to-eye contact relative to direct eye-gaze at a dynamic face video (p < 0.01). Further, activity in the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) was increased in the real eye-to-eye condition (p < 0.05, FDR corrected). Together, these findings advance a functional and mechanistic understanding of the AG and cross-brain neural coupling associated with real-time eye-to-eye contact.		[Noah, J.

The neural network comprising the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the lateral occipito-temporal cortex (LOTC) is relevant to gestural interaction. The LOTC includes the extrastriate body area (EBA). Activation of these brain regions depends on the initiating/following role in adults. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging study on 18 children and 18 adults, to elucidate developmental changes of the neural mechanism underlying gestural interaction. We manipulated the initiating/following role (initiating/following) and congruency (congruent/incongruent) of executed and observed actions. After analyzing regional brain activity, we assessed psycho-physiological interaction to examine functional connectivity. Activation in the IFG and connectivity between the IFG and EBA in the Initiating rather than Following condition, which might be associated with evaluating social relevance, was stronger in adults than in children. The increase of the incongruency effect in the following condition (relative to the initiating condition) in the bilateral IPL was significantly attenuated in children compared with adults. These results suggest that the fronto-parieto-temporal network, involved in gestural interactions, undergoes developmental changes.

However, research using neural measures to study empathy in response to social victimization is sparse, particularly for young children. In the present study, 58 children's (White, non-Hispanic; five to nine years old) mu suppression was measured using electroencephalogram methods (EEG) as they viewed video scenarios depicting social injustices toward White and Black children. We found evidence of increased mu suppression in response to social victimization; however, contrary to well-documented findings of ingroup racial bias in empathic responses among adults, we found no evidence of racial bias in mu suppression in young children. Implications of these findings for neuroscience research on empathy and the development of ingroup bias are discussed.

Objective To study the clinical benefits and adverse-event profile of bilateral PSA-DBS for refractory ET. Methods Seven patients with refractory ET underwent bilateral PSA-DBS surgery under general anesthesia between September 2017 and May 2018. Clinical outcome assessments, using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale, were performed at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, except for the last assessment of one patient who was followed up to 9 months. Analysis was focused on changes in patients' motor symptoms and quality of life following surgery as well as documenting the adverse-event profile associated with the surgical PSA-DBS treatment. Results After surgery, patients' motor symptoms, including upper limb tremor and head tremor, were improved by 84.2% and their quality of life by 81.25% at 1-month follow-up. The clinical benefits to patients were maintained at 6-month and last follow-up. Adverse side effects included dysarthria (n = 4), balance disorder (n = 2), and paresthesia of the right limb (n = 1). No habituation effects were observed throughout the follow-up. Conclusion Bilateral PSA-DBS seems to offer an effective and safe alternative treatment for medically intractable ET, warranting further research into its clinical utility, adverse-event profile, and comparative effectiveness.

Transcranial current stimulation used alone may modulate brain activity that consequently influences behaviors, without providing information on potentially induced brain activity changes. The combination of transcranial current stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help to address this. This exploratory study investigated instantaneous and subsequent effects of tDCS and tACS on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in healthy adults. Methods: We conducted a randomized crossover study with 15 healthy subjects receiving three stimulation conditions (tDCS, tACS, and sham) on separate days. Stimulation was applied over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 30 min (1 mA). rsFC of the targeted prefrontal areas was assessed before, during, and after stimulation using multiband fMRI and using left and right DLPFC as seeds. Results: Both tDCS and tACS increased rsFC during and after the stimulation period, as compared to sham. tDCS-induced changes were observed between the left DLPFC and bilateral parietal regions at the junction of the superior parietal and the inferior parietal lobules. tACS-induced changes were observed between the left DLPFC and the right inferior parietal lobule. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that a single session with a low dose, 1 mA, of tDCS or tACS can cause changes in fronto-parietal connectivity that occur rapidly, that is, within the first 15 min. Although exploratory, this work contributes to the discussion of the potential of transcranial current stimulation to modulate resting-state networks and the interest of combining transcranial current stimulation with neuroimaging to identify these changes.

In particular, ELF-MFs can influence synaptic plasticity both in vitro and in animal models but some studies reported an increase in long-term potentiation (LTP) whereas others suggested its reduction. However, no specific study has investigated such effect on humans. Aims To evaluate whether ELF-MFs affect the propensity of the human cortex to undergo LTP-like plasticity. Methods We designed a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study on 10 healthy subjects. Cortical plasticity was induced by intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) before and after 45-min ELF-MFs (75 Hz; 1.8 mT) or sham exposure and was estimated by measuring the changes of motor evoked potentials (MEP) amplitude before and after each iTBS. Results No adverse events were reported. No significant effects of ELF-MFs on cortical plasticity were found. Conclusion Whole-brain exposure to ELF-MFs (75 Hz; 1.8 mT) is safe and does not seem to significantly affect LTP-like plasticity in human motor cortex.

To counteract the possible negative effects of this, emphasis was placed on the local level as an important arena of alcohol prevention. Thus, considerable efforts were made to strengthen alcohol prevention in Swedish municipalities. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine whether local alcohol prevention reduced consumption and alcohol-related harm in Swedish municipalities. Methods: Alcohol prevention was monitored using a composite measure called the Alcohol Prevention Magnitude Measure (APMM), with subcategories of staff and budget, inspections and licenses, policy, activities, and cooperation. APMM and its categories were analysed in relation to alcohol consumption and harm over time, 2006-2014. A fixed effects model was used with 63% (N=182, consumption) and 71% (N=207, harm) of 290 Swedish municipalities, respectively, included in the analyses. Results: The main results suggest that when APMM increases with 1 percent, the alcohol-related mortality decreases with 0.26 percent, controlled for changes in population size, median income, unemployment, and post-secondary education. In light of this result, the estimated effect of APMM on alcohol consumption (sales) is small (0.02 percent decrease); possible explanations for this are discussed in the article. Conclusion: The overall results indicate that local alcohol prevention initiatives in Sweden have reduced some forms of alcohol-related harm, not least alcohol-related mortality, during the period 2006-2014. Further studies are needed to assess the generalizability of the present study.

One-hundred and sixty five participants took part in the study. Six minutes of eyes closed EEG resting state was recorded for each participant. Graph theoretical connectivity metrics were calculated separately for two well-established synchronization measures [weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and Imaginary Coherence (iMCOH)] and for sensor- and source EEG space. Non-verbal intelligence was measured with Raven's Progressive Matrices. In line with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis, path lengths characteristics of the brain networks (Average and Characteristic Path lengths, Diameter and Closeness Centrality) within alpha band range were significantly correlated with non-verbal intelligence for sensor space but no for source space. According to our results, variance in non-verbal intelligence measure can be mainly explained by the graph metrics built from the networks that include both weak and strong connections between the nodes.

Representation of Perceptual Evidence in the Human Brain Assessed by Fast, Within-Trial Dynamic Stimuli								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						9	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00009			FEB 4 2020	2020	In perceptual decision making the brain extracts and accumulates decision evidence from a stimulus over time and eventually makes a decision based on the accumulated evidence. Several characteristics of this process have been observed in human electrophysiological experiments, especially an average build-up of motor-related signals supposedly reflecting accumulated evidence, when averaged across trials. Another recently established approach to investigate the representation of decision evidence in brain signals is to correlate the within-trial fluctuations of decision evidence with the measured signals. We here report results of this approach for a two-alternative forced choice reaction time experiment measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Our results show: (1) that decision evidence is most strongly represented in the MEG signals in three consecutive phases and (2) that posterior cingulate cortex is involved most consistently, among all brain areas, in all three of the identified phases. As most previous work on perceptual decision making in the brain has focused on parietal and motor areas, our findings therefore suggest that the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in perceptual decision making may be currently underestimated.

Objectives: We used peer crowds (macro-level subcultures) to identify subgroups of adolescents at-risk for using and being open to using cigarettes; cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars (cigar products); hookah; e-cigarettes; any tobacco product; and multiple products. Methods: In 2017, youth ages 12-17 in five U.S. states completed cross-sectional surveys (n = 1,167). Participants provided data on cigarette use (experimentation) and openness to use (susceptibility); cigar product, hookah, and e-cigarette use (ever use) and openness to use (curiosity); and identification with five peer crowds (Alternative, Country, Hip Hop, Mainstream, Popular). We used chi-square tests to compare rates by peer crowd, and multivariate logistic regressions to assess odds of use and openness for each crowd (reference: Mainstream). Results: Risk differed by peer crowd. Hip Hop youth reported high rates of use, ranging from 12.8% (cigarettes) to 33.4% (e-cigarettes). Regressions revealed increased odds of use for Hip Hop compared to Mainstream for all products, especially cigar products and multi-product use. Popular (cigar products, e-cigarettes) and Alternative (cigarettes) demonstrated increased odds of use compared to Mainstream. We also observed elevated odds of cigarette openness among Alternative, Country, and Hip Hop youth, and of hookah openness among Hip Hop and Popular youth compared to Mainstream.

SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	7			1035	1044		10.1080/10826084.2020.1722697			APR 15 2020	2020	Background: This study aimed to identify pattern of substance use among patients at two public addiction rehabilitation centers in Amman. It provided a description of substance use career and assessment of addiction severity, quality of life and quality of sleep among participants. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study using a structured data collection form consisting of 4 parts: 1. General data including the demographic characteristics, medical history and career of drug abuse. 2. Severity of addiction using the severity of dependence scale (SDS). 3. Quality of life measured by the EQ-5D and 4. Quality of sleep measured by the insomnia severity index (ISI) scale. Results: A total of 93 patients from 2 treatment settings were recruited over 5 months. The total number of actively used substances was 196, with an average of 2 substances per patient. Alcohol and synthetic cannabinoids were the two most commonly used substances (39.8% and 38.7% respectively) followed by benzodiazepines (33.4%). A notable drop in heroin use was observed (5.4%, 5 out of 23 opioid user) compared to the years 2007-2009. The mean SDS score among patients was 11.43 (SD +/- 3.48) indicating high dependence. Sleep problems were reported by 45% of patients. Data showed a significant role of community pharmacies in supplying drugs of abuse for users. Conclusion: Pattern of substance use changed significantly in Jordan with synthetic cannabinoids being of the top substances used and heroin use dropping. Actions should be taken to reframe the legalization of dispensing certain drugs by pharmacists without a prescription.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				31	4			583	600		10.1080/09602011.2020.1717969			APR 21 2021	2021	Sleep disturbances, especially insomnia, are common and associated with poor outcomes in children following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Yet, clinical treatment guidelines are lacking. Thus, we developed a manualized cognitive-behavioural programme for treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) in children who sustained TBI. The aim of this study was to determine acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the programme from the service providers' perspective. This observational study used an explanatory mixed-methods design. Fifteen clinicians experienced in working with children, patients with sleep disturbances or brain injuries participated. On review of the treatment programme, clinicians completed an online survey assessing (i) the overall format, aesthetics, and clarity of the programme, and (i) the overall quality of the intervention. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis. Clinician's ratings indicated a high level of agreement in the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the programme, ranging from 70.9% (the therapist manual) to 86.9% (the intervention approach). Thematic analysis revealed suggestions that related to the developmental appropriateness, feasibility, and usability of the programme. The findings of our study will be used to modify the CBT-I treatment programme that will be further validated in a feasibility clinical trial involving children aged 6-10 years who sustained TBI.

J	Luna, Raul; Serrano-Pedraza, Ignacio								Interaction between motion scales: When performance in motion discrimination is worse for a compound stimulus than for its integrating components								VISION RESEARCH				167				60	69		10.1016/j.visres.2019.12.002			FEB 2020	2020	Motion direction discrimination becomes impaired when combinations of drifting high spatial frequency (HSF) and static low spatial frequency (LSF) patterns are merged into a compound stimulus. Such impairment has been suggested to occur due to an interaction between motion sensors tuned to coarse and fine scale spatial patterns. This interaction is modulated by different stimulus parameters like temporal frequency, size, the spectral components mixed, and their relative contrast. The present research precisely aims to explore in a deeper way the interaction's dependency upon the spatial frequency and the relative contrast of the components when both move cohereuntly. Two experiments were therefore performed measuring duration thresholds (Experiment 1) and proportion of correct responses (Experiment 2) in a motion direction discrimination task. Stimuli were vertical Gabor patches of 4 deg diameter horizontally drifting with a speed of 2 deg/sec. Simple LSF and HSF stimuli as well as complex stimuli where both components moved coherently (LSFm + HSFm) were used. These were grouped in the following LSF and HSF pairs: 0.25-0.75, 0.5-1.5, 1-3 and 2-6 c/deg. Each component had a Michelson contrast of 28% or 7%, giving rise to different relative contrast combinations. Most interestingly, the results show a decrease in performance for complex stimuli with respect to each of their simple components when the LSF component has a lower contrast than the HSF one. The decrease depends on the particular spatial frequencies mixed in a stimulus. Further knowledge about the inhibitory mechanism is thus provided, revealing its joint dependency upon contrast and spatial frequency.

The 'anti-shift': Shifting attention opposite to a saccade								VISION RESEARCH				167				31	38		10.1016/j.visres.2019.06.009			FEB 2020	2020	The eyes usually shift with attention, but is this connection necessary? We tested whether saccades can be de-coupled from endogenous attention shifts by comparing pro-shifts, in which they move together, to anti-shifts in which attention is tasked to shift in one direction while the eyes saccade in the opposite direction. Saccade latency was measured by an eye tracker. The attention shift latency was derived using the RSVP 'attention shift paradigm' of Reeves and Sperling (1986), in which attention shifts from a target embedded in a stream of letters to a stream of numerals, of which the first four are to be noted. Initially, anti-shifts were impossible; either the eye or attention shifted first. But after 10 h of practice, five of the six adult subjects learnt how to execute saccades, shift attention, and retain numerals, almost equally well whether performing anti-shifts or pro-shifts. The results imply that brain structures such as the frontal eye fields do not inevitably yoke fixational and attentional movements together.

Are the inverse-duration and inverse-proximity effects in temporal integration subserved by independent mechanisms?								VISION RESEARCH				167				24	30		10.1016/j.visres.2019.09.009			FEB 2020	2020	Displays shorter than about 100 ms are normally seen as lasting longer than their physical duration. This visible persistence can bridge a temporal gap between two sequential stimuli causing them to be temporally integrated into a single percept. We investigated two findings in the temporal-integration literature: the inverse duration effect (temporal integration is progressively impaired as the duration of the first stimulus is increased) and the inverse proximity effect (temporal integration is progressively impaired as the spatial proximity between the stimuli is increased). In two experiments we asked whether the two effects are separable (i.e., whether they are subserved by independent mechanisms) or interact with one another. To estimate the duration of visible persistence we used the missing element paradigm in Experiment 1 and directional stroboscopic motion between two lines in Experiment 2. In both experiments we manipulated the duration of the leading stimulus and the spatial gap between the elements of the two sequential displays. Additive-factors logic was employed to examine the separability of the effects of duration and proximity. Independence (separability) of the two factors would be evidenced in a graph in which the functions of duration over proximity are parallel. The results pointed uniformly to separability. A plausible mechanism for the inverse duration effect is the burst of processing activity time-locked to stimulus onset. A plausible mechanism for the inverse proximity effect is lateral inhibition that acts to reduce the visible persistence of the leading stimulus.

Fitting different visual models to behavioral patterns of parasitic egg rejection along a natural egg color gradient in a cavity-nesting host species								VISION RESEARCH				167				54	59		10.1016/j.visres.2019.12.007			FEB 2020	2020	Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and hosts can mitigate the fitness cost of raising unrelated offspring by rejecting parasitic eggs. A visually-based cognitive mechanism often thought to be used by hosts to discriminate the foreign egg is to compare it against the hosts' own eggshell by size, shape, maculation, and/or ground coloration (i.e., absolute chromatic contrast). However, hosts may instead discriminate eggs based on their colors along a scale of natural avian eggshell coloration (i.e., directional chromatic contrast). In support of this latter visual process, recent research has found that directional chromatic contrasts can explain some host species' rejection behavior better than absolute chromatic or achromatic contrasts. Here, for the first time, we conducted an experiment in a cavity-nesting host species to test the predictions of these different visual mechanisms. We experimentally parasitized nests of the Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, a regular host of a mimetic-egg laying Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus host-race, using painted, immaculate 3D-printed model eggs in two geographically distant areas (Finland and Czech Republic). We found that directional chromatic contrasts better explained rejection behaviors in both parasitized (Finland) and non-parasitized (Czech Republic) host populations, as hosts rejected eggs that were noticeably browner, but not eggs that were noticeably bluer, than redstart eggs. These results support the paradigm of a single rejection threshold predicted by the directional chromatic contrast model and contribute to a growing generality of these patterns across diverse avian host-brood parasite systems.

However, visual images can facilitate detection of visual Gabor patterns. Here we report that this discrepancy is not due so much to the class of stimuli but primarily to the level of accuracy; visual imagery interferes with acuity when performance is good but facilitates it when performance is poor. This finding is analogous to the 'dipper' function obtained when visual stimuli that mask visual targets when above threshold improve target detection near threshold.

VISION RESEARCH				167				87	99		10.1016/j.visres.2019.12.001			FEB 2020	2020	We describe and analyze the performance of metric learning systems, including deep neural networks (DNNs), on a new dataset of human visual object shape similarity judgments of naturalistic, part-based objects known as "Fribbles". In contrast to previous studies which asked participants to judge similarity when objects or scenes were rendered from a single viewpoint, we rendered Fribbles from multiple viewpoints and asked participants to judge shape similarity in a viewpoint-invariant manner. Metrics trained using pixel-based or DNN-based representations fail to explain our experimental data, but a metric trained with a viewpoint-invariant, part-based representation produces a good fit. We also find that although neural networks can learn to extract the part-based representation-and therefore should be capable of learning to model our data-networks trained with a "triplet loss" function based on similarity judgments do not perform well. We analyze this failure, providing a mathematical description of the relationship between the metric learning objective function and the triplet loss function. The poor performance of neural networks appears to be due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem in network weight space. We conclude that viewpoint insensitivity is a critical aspect of human visual shape perception, and that neural network and other machine learning methods will need to learn viewpoint-insensitive representations in order to account for people's visual object shape similarity judgments.

Human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, exhibit sex-related pathology, but sex-related neurodevelopment has not been fully investigated in this model. We conducted this study to facilitate the understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods: Pregnant rats received 50 mg/kg BrdU on gestational days 9-15. The tissue content of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were measured in male and female offspring at 3 weeks (juveniles) and 10 weeks (adults) of age. Results: Prenatally BrdU-treated rats had reduced DA metabolism or DA content in the hypothalamus from the juvenile through the adult period without sex differences, but sex-specific striatal DA abnormalities emerged after maturation. A reduction in 5-HT metabolism was measured in the hypothalamus without sex differences throughout development. Developmental alterations in the striatal 5-HT states were sex-dependent. Temporal changes in DA or 5-HT metabolism were found in the frontal cortex and midbrain. Conclusion: The sex-specific influence of a genotoxic factor on the development of the DA and 5-HT systems was clarified in the hypothalamus and striatum. The results suggest that the observed sex dependence and region specificity are related to the pathology of social dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Although many previous studies have investigated the mean or variance representation itself, a relationship between these two ensemble representations has not been investigated much. In this study, we tested the potential interaction between mean and variance representations by using a visual adaptation method. We reasoned that if mean and variance representations interact with each other, an adaptation aftereffect to either mean or variance would influence the perception of the other. Participants watched a sequence of orientation arrays containing a specific statistical property during the adaptation period. To produce an adaptation aftereffect specific to variance or mean, one property of the adaptor arrays (variance or mean) had a fixed value while the other property was randomly varied. After the adaptation, participants were asked to discriminate the property of the test array that was randomly varied during the adaptation. We found that the adaptation aftereffect of orientation variance influenced the sensitivity of mean orientation discrimination (Experiment 1), and that the adaptation aftereffect of mean orientation influenced the bias of orientation variance discrimination (Experiment 2). These results suggest that mean and variance representations do closely interact with each other. Considering that mean and variance reflect the representative value and dispersion of multiple items respectively, the interactions between mean and variance representations may reflect their complementary roles to summarize complex visual information effectively.

However, human-like performance of ffCNNs does not necessarily imply human-like computations. Previous studies have suggested that current ffCNNs do not make use of global shape information. However, it is currently unclear whether this reflects fundamental differences between ffCNN and human processing or is merely an artefact of how ffCNNs are trained. Here, we use visual crowding as a well-controlled, specific probe to test global shape computations. Our results provide evidence that ffCNNs cannot produce human-like global shape computations for principled architectural reasons. We lay out approaches that may address shortcomings of ffCNNs to provide better models of the human visual system.		[Doerig, A.; Bornet, A.; Choung, O. H.; Herzog, M.

Modeling visual fields using virtual ophthalmoscopy: Incorporating geometrical optics, morphometrics, and 3D visualization to validate an interdisciplinary technique								VISION RESEARCH				167				70	86		10.1016/j.visres.2019.11.007			FEB 2020	2020	Visual fields are of particular interest to comparative biologists studying the complex interplay between anatomy, physiology, ecology, and optics. Visual fields have been measured in nearly 100 bird species, and investigators have uncovered associations between quantitative aspects of visual fields and foraging behavior, skull dimensions, and even brain morphology. However, limiting factors including time, access to living subjects, and experimental constraints complicate study of the visual apparatus of rare, endangered, or extinct species. We introduce a modeling technique called virtual ophthalmoscopy (VO) for estimating visual fields of vertebrates. We compare this in-silico technique, which draws on geometrical optics, morphometrics of eyes, and 3D visualization, against experimental data from 12 bird species from behavioral literature. Known values of optical properties, including axial length, lens curvatures, and refractive index, are used to construct and test virtual, schematic eyes in ray-tracing software. Resulting visual fields are measured in 3D-visualization software. These measurements are compared qualitatively and quantitatively with visual fields from the literature. Schematic eyeballs and in-silico visual fields, after iterative improvements using anatomical information from cadaveric specimens, approximate experimental data to the extent of falling within the range of intraspecific variation, suggesting VO is a viable technique for modeling visual fields. Virtual ophthalmoscopy creates an opportunity to expand the sample of species for which visual fields can be quantified and allows new hypotheses regarding the evolution of visual systems to be tested.

However, many previous studies found that the relationship between foveal letter identification and flanker separation is non-monotonic, with an upturn in performance at very small target-to-flanker separations. Here, we replicate this observation and show that a similar upturn occurs also for targets presented at 5 deg in the inferior field, if the target-to-flanker separation is sufficiently small. The presence and magnitude of the observed performance upturn depends on the flanking-bar width, being more evident for narrower compared to wider flanking bars. We interpret our results to indicate that neural interactions between nearby contours reduce performance when the target and flanking bars form discrete neural images. At sufficiently small separations, the images of the target and flanking bars can not be distinguished and performance is governed by the contrast of the target in the blended neural image.

In the present study, we investigated if and to what extent specific voxel-based morphometric brain volume differences could be observed among individuals with methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MAIP) and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) compared to healthy controls. Methods: A total of 69 individuals took part in the present study. Of those, 26 were diagnosed with MAIP, 23 with SSD, and 20 were healthy controls. After a thorough psychiatric assessment, participants underwent brain volume measurement. Results: Compared to healthy controls, participants with MAIP had smaller volumes for left caudate and left and right parahippocampal gyrus. Compared to healthy controls, participants with SSD had smaller volumes for the gray and white matter, left amygdala, left hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left putamen, and the total volume. Compared to individuals with MAIP, individuals with SSD had a lower white matter brain volume. Conclusions: The pattern of results suggests that individuals with MAIP and SSD showed specific and regional brain atrophies on the left hemisphere, always compared to healthy controls. Given the cross-sectional design, it remains undisclosed if specific and regional brain atrophies were the cause or the consequence of the psychiatric issues.

Methods: The cognitive function of rats was evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test and the novel object recognition test. The content of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end (TUNEL) staining. The expression of the BDNF protein was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: We found that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) significantly reversed the impairment in the function of learning and memory in the MWM test and the novel objective recognition task induced by intracerebroventricular injection of FA. We also showed that NaHS significantly reduced the level of MDA, elevated the level of SOD, and decreased the amount of TUNEL-positive neurons in the hippocampus of FA-exposed rats. Moreover, NaHS markedly increased the expression of hippocampal BDNF in FA-exposed rats. Conclusions: H2S attenuates FA-induced dysfunction of cognition and the underlying mechanism is involved in the reduction of hippocampal oxidative damage and apoptosis as well as upregulation of hippocampal BDNF.

J	Seeliger, Christian; Lippold, Julia V.; Reuter, Martin								Variation on the CRH Gene Determines the Different Performance of Opioid Addicts and Healthy Controls in the IOWA Gambling Task								NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY				79	2			150	160		10.1159/000504227			FEB 2020	2020	Background: The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the biological substrate of stress reactivity, and related genetic variations play a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of drug addiction. On the behavioral level, substance abusers are characterized by impulsivity and the inability to pursue long-term goals. The neural substrate of these behaviors is assumed to be related to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). One of the most established paradigms to assess VMPFC deficiency is the IOWA gambling task (IGT). Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between the HPA axis-related genetic variation on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; secreted from the hypothalamus and constituting the starting point of the HPA axis) gene and opioid addiction, with respect to IGT performance. There is some evidence that stress and pathological HPA axis hyperactivity, in the same way as drug addiction, is related to a poorer IGT performance. Methods: In total, 138 long-term opioid addicts (mean age 38.63 years [SD 9.15]) and 160 healthy controls (mean age 22.57 years [SD 5.86]) performed the IGT and were genotyped for 6 SNPs covering the CRH gene and adjacent regions (rs3176921, rs6999780, rs7816410, rs1870393, rs1814583, and rs11996294). The first 5 of these 6 SNPs build a haplotype block spanning 15 kb on the CRH gene. Results: We found a significant group difference in the total IGT score, with higher scores in controls than in opioids. Most interestingly, there was a 3-way interaction, group x haplotype x block. Carriers homozygous for the TGTAA-haplotype differed in IGT performance dependent on group. In the control group, carriers homozygous for the TGTAA-haplotype showed a linear learning curve across blocks of trials, which was not observed in participants without this homozygosity. There were diametric effects in opioid addicts. Controlling for age and gender did not change the findings. Conclusion: This study provides genetic evidence for the interplay between stress, decision-making, and opioid addiction.

Impact of Season of Birth on Psychiatric Disorder Susceptibility and Drug Abuse Incidence in a Population from the Koppen Tropical Savanna Region of Brazil								NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY				79	2			131	140		10.1159/000503069			FEB 2020	2020	Background: Despite much evidence that season of birth (SOB) my influence the vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, divergence has been reported, in particular between populations born in the northern and southern hemispheres. We analyzed the potential modified risk by SOB to psychiatric disorder or drug addiction comorbidity in a population born in the Triangulo Mineiro region, a southern hemisphere Koppen tropical savanna region in Brazil. Method: We accessed the records of 98,457 of patients and healthy controls of the National Datacenter of Medical Promptuary to evaluate the influence of SOB as a modifying factor on the occurrence of mental disorders and drug abuse conditions among individuals born from the year 2000 to 2016. Results: The data revealed significant modification of the relative incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) (F11, 72 = 2.898; p = 0.003; eta-squared, ES = 0.313; ? = 0.97), anxiety-related disorder (ARD) (F11, 81 =2.389; p = 0.013; ES = 0.241; ? = 0.932), and schizophrenia (SZ) (F11, 83 = 2.764; p = 0.005; ES = 0.303; alpha = 0.963), while there was no increase in the number of healthy controls born in any month of the year (F11, 71 = 1.469; p = 0.163). Post hoc analyses indicated a significant higher vulnerability to MDD or ARD if the patient was born in August, or October to December, respectively. A relative increase in the incidence of SZ was also observed in patients born from August to October, compared to patients born from November to January. Conclusions: SOB may influence the risk for psychiatric disorders in the TMR population. Regional particularities associated with the climatic regime may account for the apparent divergence between studies.

Is Strength Training as Effective as Aerobic Training for Depression in Older Adults? A Randomized Controlled Trial								NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY				79	2			141	149		10.1159/000503750			FEB 2020	2020	Background: This study aimed to compare the effects of aerobic training (AT), strength training (ST) and low-intensity exercise in a control group (CG) as adjunct treatments to pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) in older persons. Methods: Older persons clinically diagnosed with MDD (n = 27) and treated with antidepressants were blindly randomized into three groups: AT, ST and a CG. All patients were evaluated prior to and 12 weeks after the intervention. Results: Compared with the CG, the AT and ST groups showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms (treatment response = 50% decrease in the pre- to postintervention assessment) through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (AT group: chi(2), p = 0.044) and Beck Depression Inventory (ST group: chi(2), p = 0.044). Conclusion: Adding AT or ST with moderate intensity to the usual treatment promoted a greater reduction of MDD symptoms.

Genetic dissection of rod and cone pathways mediating light responses and receptive fields of ganglion cells in the mouse retina								VISION RESEARCH				167				15	23		10.1016/j.visres.2019.12.005			FEB 2020	2020	Retinal ganglion cells (GCs) are important visual neurons which carry complex spatiotemporal information from the retina to higher visual centers in the brain. By taking advantage of pathway-specific knockout/mutant mice and multi-electrode array (MEA) recording techniques, we analyze contributions of rod and cone pathways to responsiveness, kinetics and receptive field profiles of GCs under scotopic and photopic conditions. Our data suggest: (1) Scotopic responses of some GCs require all three rod pathways, some require only the secondary and tertiary rod pathways, and others require only the tertiary rod pathway. (2) There are more responsive GCs in photopic conditions than responsive GCs in scotopic conditions. (3) Gap junctions slow down GCs' scotopic light responses and increase GCs' ratio of antagonistic to center inputs. (4) Cone pathways do not affect the kinetics but alter the ratio of antagonistic to center inputs of scotopic GC responses, and they speed up GCs photopic responses and alter the ratio of GCs' antagonistic to center synaptic inputs and receptive field profiles. (5) Rod bipolar cells shorten response latency of ON GCs and increase the ratio of GCs' antagonistic to center synaptic inputs. (6) Light adaptation speeds up GCs' temporal processing and tunes GC photopic responses to higher frequencies, and the tertiary rod pathway plays a significant role in adaptation-induced TTP changes in some GCs. (7) GC RF center sizes are partially mediated by AIIACs and GC-GC coupling. (8) Connexin36 gap junctions and cone pathways alter synaptic circuits underlying antagonistic surround inputs to GCs in photopic conditions.		[Seilheimer, R. L.; Sabharwal, J.; Wu, S.

Little is known of the alcohol consumption patterns of health-profession students. Objectives: To assess the association of knowledge of alcohol-related harm (KAH), and exposure to media-based promotional alcohol sales advertisements (PASA) and alcohol hazard warnings (AHW) with drinking frequency of health-profession university students. Methods: Health-profession students (N = 1277) in the Medical University of Inner Mongolia were interviewed in 2017 regarding their alcohol drinking frequency, KAH, and exposure to PASA and AHW. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between exposure and drinking frequency. Results: Overall, 9% were nondrinkers, 35% occasional drinkers, and 56% frequent drinkers. Females were slightly less commonly drinkers but more commonly frequent drinkers. The prevalence of drinking decreased with age. Mongolians were more commonly frequent drinkers than Han. A majority of students had low KAH. Exposure to PASA was more common among drinkers, and exposure to AHW more common among nondrinkers. The main reason for drinking was social gathering. The relative probability of being an occasional or frequent drinker was lower among older students, those with higher KAH, and those exposed to AHW on television and internet but higher among those exposed to PASA in mini-supermarkets on campus. Conclusions: Students' drinking behavior was associated with low KAH and exposure to alcohol advertisements and warning media messages. Prevalence of frequent drinking might be reduced by wider use of AHW on internet and television and improving the level of knowledge of alcohol-related harm.

High Prevalence of Tobacco Product and E-Cigarette Use among Electronic Dance Music Party Attendees								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	10			1561	1566		10.1080/10826084.2020.1717536			JUL 1 2020	2020	Background: Electronic dance music (EDM) party attendees are at high risk for use of various illegal drugs; however, little is known about their tobacco use. Understanding tobacco use patterns in this population at high risk for illegal drug use can inform multi-product interventions. Objectives: 954 EDM party attendees (ages 18-40) were surveyed in New York City in 2017. We estimated prevalence of use of cigarettes, hookah, cigars, other tobacco, and e-cigarettes and delineated correlates of current (past-month) use using bivariable and multivariable models. Results: Past-month use of cigarettes (36.2%), e-cigarettes (15.6%), cigars (12.5%), and hookah (11.7%) in particular was prevalent. In multivariable models, females were less likely to use e-cigarettes than males (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.63, p = .030), and those who attended graduate school were less likely to use cigarettes (aPR = 0.55, p = .003) and/or e-cigarettes (aPR = 0.33, p = .026). Past-year ecstasy/MDMA/Molly use was a risk factor for past-month use of cigarettes (aPR = 1.38, p = .013) and/or cigars (aPR = 1.61, p = .032), and past-year cocaine use was a risk factor for past-month use of cigarettes (aPR = 1.80, p < .001), cigars (aPR = 1.80, p = .013), other tobacco products (aPR = 3.05, p = .003), and/or e-cigarettes (aPR = 2.39, p = .003). 55.4% of ecstasy users and 60.3% of cocaine users were current cigarette smokers, but use of other products among users of these drugs was less prevalent (9.8-27.9%). Conclusions: Results suggest that current tobacco use is prevalent in this population who is also at high risk for use of drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine. Prevention and cessation efforts need to target tobacco users in this scene while incorporating components addressing illegal drug use.

Although its clinical presentation is well described in the literature, data regarding prevention is lacking. We aimed to assess proportion and correlates of cotton fever experience among people who inject opioids. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the community-based survey PrebupIV conducted in France in 2015 among 557 people who regularly injected opioids. Self-reported sociodemographic data, together with data on substance use, injecting practices and occurrence of cotton fever were all collected through face-to-face (n = 398) or online (n = 159) questionnaires. Factors associated with cotton fever experience were assessed using logistic regression model. Results: Over half of the participants (54%) reported cotton fever experience. In the multivariable logistic regression, crack cocaine injection (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.96, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.03-3.63), longer duration of opioid use (for 1 year of use: aOR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.02-1.09), and filtering mainly with cotton filters (compared with membrane filters, aOR = 1.86, 95%CI = 1.24-2.78) were all associated with cotton fever experience. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that cotton fever is a frequent complication of injecting drug use. Avoiding the use and reuse of cotton balls to filter injected solutions, and promoting membrane filters use could reduce the risk of the condition occurring.

Even when a person is in a resting state, brain connectivity dynamically shifts. However, shifted brain connectivity under externally evoked stimulus is still little understood. The current study, therefore, focuses on task-based dynamic functional-connectivity (FC) analysis of brain signals measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We hypothesize that a stimulus may influence not only brain connectivity but also the occurrence probabilities of task-related and task-irrelevant connectivity states. fNIRS measurement (of the prefrontal-to-inferior parietal lobes) was conducted on 21 typically developing (TD) and 21 age-matched attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children performing an inhibitory control task, namely, the Go/No-Go (GNG) task. It has been reported that ADHD children lack inhibitory control; differences between TD and ADHD children in terms of task-based dynamic FC were also evaluated. Four connectivity states were found to occur during the temporal task course. Two dominant connectivity states (states 1 and 2) are characterized by strong connectivities within the frontoparietal network (occurrence probabilities of 40%-56% and 26%-29%), and presumptively interpreted as task-related states. A connectivity state (state 3) shows strong connectivities in the bilateral medial frontal-to-parietal cortices (occurrence probability of 7-15%). The strong connectivities were found at the overlapped regions related the default mode network (DMN). Another connectivity state (state 4) visualizes strong connectivities in all measured regions (occurrence probability of 10%-16%). A global effect coming from cerebral vascular may highly influence this connectivity state. During the GNG stimulus interval, the ADHD children tended to show decreased occurrence probability of the dominant connectivity state and increased occurrence probability of other connectivity states (states 3 and 4). Bringing a new perspective to explain neuropathophysiology, these findings suggest atypical dynamic network recruitment to accommodate task demands in ADHD children.

The aMCI patients may have only a memory deficit (single-domain-aMCI, sd-aMCI) or deficits in multiple cognitive domains (multiple-domain-aMCI, md-aMCI). However, differences in intrinsic brain activity between these two sub-types remain unclear. Method: Neuropsychological and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 24 patients with sd-aMCI, 23 patients with md-aMCI, and 32 healthy controls (HCs). We used the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to characterize the intensity of spontaneous brain activity. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post hoc tests was performed to determine the between-group differences in fALFF. Results: We found higher fALFF in left-sided superior-to-middle frontal gyri and middle-to-inferior temporal gyri in sd-aMCI compared to both the md-aMCI and HCs. Conversely, a lower fALFF was found in the left inferior parietal lobe in both the md-aMCI and sd-aMCI patients. The fALFF values in the left middle and inferior temporal gyri were correlated with cognitive performances. Conclusion: The gradual reduction in the left inferior parietal lobe from single to multiple domain aMCI suggest a functional inefficiency underlying cognitive impairment, while increased activity in the frontal and temporal gyri in sd-aMCI rather than md-aMCI might indicate functional compensation. This study indicates differential functional profiles in the sd-aMCI and md-aMCI, which may be helpful for the prediction of the future conversion of aMCI to AD.

A Daily-Level Analysis of Moderators of the Association between Alcohol Expectancies and Alcohol Use among College Student Drinkers								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	6			973	982		10.1080/10826084.2020.1717535			APR 1 2020	2020	Background: Alcohol expectancies, or the perceived likelihood of experiencing certain effects after consuming alcohol, are associated with college student drinking such that heavier drinkers expect a greater likelihood of positive effects. However, less is known as to whether day-to-day within-person deviations in expectancies are associated with drinking that same day and for whom and when these associations may be strongest. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine daily-level associations of positive and negative alcohol expectancies with alcohol use, and whether associations differed according to demographic characteristics and additional alcohol-related constructs. Methods: College student drinkers (N = 327, 53.8% female) participated in an intensive longitudinal study that captured daily-level data. Alcohol use and expectancy measures were utilized from a baseline session and at the daily-level using Interactive Voice Response (IVR). Results: Results found that on days when participants reported stronger positive and negative expectancies than their average, they were more likely to drink as well as consume more alcohol when drinking. Moderation analyses revealed that positive expectancies were more positively associated with the likelihood of any drinking for women relative to men, and more positively associated with the quantity of alcohol consumption for younger students, students with lower baseline rates of drinking, and students with greater overall positive alcohol expectancies. Conclusions/Importance: The findings demonstrate that alcohol expectancies fluctuate within-person across days and these fluctuations are meaningful in predicting same-day drinking. Interventions that seek to modify expectancies proximal to drinking events may be considered to reduce college student drinking.

However, factors associated with e-cigarette use among young adults are not well known. Methods: We used data from the 2015 French TEMPO community based cohort study, restricted to current and former smokers with data on e-cigarette use (n = 368 adults, 23-41 years). Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire including information on family status, educational attainment, occupation and type of work contract, health problems, alcohol and cannabis use, electronic cigarette use, as well as perceptions of e-cigarettes. Use of traditional tobacco was assessed in 2011 and 2015. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. Results: Among current and former smokers, 26.9% reported lifetime e-cigarettes use and 15.2% current use. Factors associated with lifetime use were: low socioeconomic position (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-4.2), traditional cigarette use (OR associated with smoking in 2011 and 2015 = 13.1; 95% CI = 5.2-32.6) and positive perceptions of e-cigarettes (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2.4-8.1) as well as asthma (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 0.9-4.9) and overweight/obesity (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 0.9-6.9). Factors associated with current use were traditional cigarette smoking (OR associated with smoking in 2011 and 2015 = 3.9; 95% CI= 1.3-12.2) and positive perceptions of e-cigarettes (OR =4.4; 95% CI = 2.3-8.4). Conclusions: Young adults who use e-cigarettes tend to persist in smoking traditional cigarettes. The conditions under which e-cigarette use can help individuals quit traditional tobacco products remain to be elucidated.

Objectives: In the present study, we examine trends in binge and heavy drinking. We used data from the 2011-2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. For trend analyses, we used logistic regression for heavy drinking and binge drinking variables. Joinpoint model analysis was conducted to identify where significant changes in trend occurred. Results: The trend analysis indicated that the overall prevalence of binge drinking decreased significantly from 18.3% in 2011 to 16.0% in 2014, then increased significantly to 17.0% in 2017. This trend was also found for heavy drinking, with a significant decrease from 6.6% in 2011 to 5.8% in 2014, then increased significantly to 6.2% in 2017. This trend persisted for certain subgroups; males, females, White participants, and the 35-54 age group all had a similar decrease in prevalence followed by an increase from 2014-2017. Conclusions: Overall, our results indicate a recent significant increase in both binge and heavy drinking among the general population.

Right Temporoparietal Junction Involvement in Autonomic Responses to the Suffering of Others: A Preliminary Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						7	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00007			JAN 28 2020	2020	Functional neuroimaging studies have emphasized distinct networks for social cognition and affective aspects of empathy. However, studies have not considered whether substrates of social cognition, such as the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), play a role in affective responses to complex empathy-related stimuli. Here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test whether the right TPJ contributes to psychophysiological responses to another person's emotional suffering. We used a theory of mind functional localizer and image-guided TMS to target the sub-region of the right TPJ implicated in social cognition, and measured autonomic and subjective responses to an empathy induction video. We found evidence that TMS applied at 1 Hz over the right TPJ increased withdrawal of parasympathetic nervous system activity during the empathy induction (n = 32), but did not affect sympathetic nervous system activity (n = 27). Participants who received TMS over the right TPJ also reported feeling more irritation and annoyance, and were less likely to report feeling compassion over and above empathic sadness, than participants who received TMS over the vertex (N = 34). This study provides preliminary evidence for the role of right TPJ functioning in empathy-related psychophysiological and affective responding, potentially blurring the distinction between neural regions specific to social cognition vs. affective aspects of empathy.

The present study aims to analyze how older adults' objective cognitive functioning and self-reported subjective wayfinding inclinations predict their navigation performance. Sixty-four older adults were assessed on their general cognitive functioning (all scoring from 22 to 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), visuospatial working memory (VSWM), and perspective-taking abilities. Their self-assessed wayfinding inclinations (such as their sense of direction, pleasure in exploring places, and spatial anxiety) were also examined. Then participants learned a path in an environment from video navigation and performed a route repetition task (which maintained the same egocentric perspective as the learning phase), and a sketch map task (which involved switching from an egocentric perspective used in the learning phase to an allocentric perspective). The results showed that positive wayfinding inclinations (in terms of pleasure in exploring) related to participants' route repetition accuracy, while their general cognitive performance (MoCA scores) related to their sketch map drawing accuracy. Individual factors such as cognitive functioning and wayfinding inclinations relate differently to older people's navigation performance, depending on the demands of the tasks used to test their environment learning.

American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) adolescents have a higher prevalence of commercial tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use than other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. It is unclear whether cultural factors such as ethnic identity, spirituality, and ceremonial use of traditional tobacco are associated with substance use, especially use of emerging tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes, among AIAN adolescents. Methods. This study investigated the association between hypothesized cultural protective factors (ethnic identity, spirituality, and ceremonial use of traditional tobacco) and past-month use of commercial cigarettes, e-cigarettes, marijuana, blunts, and alcohol among 156 AIAN adolescents in California (mean age = 15.3 years, 55% female). Adolescents from six AIAN schools and afterschool programs completed paper-and-pencil surveys. We used Logistic regression analyses to identify the significant cultural correlates of past-month substance use, controlling for demographic covariates. Results. As hypothesized, strong ethnic identity was protective against cigarette, marijuana, and alcohol use. However, it was not protective against e-cigarette or blunt use. Spirituality was associated with an increased risk of cigarette and marijuana use. Previous ceremonial use of traditional tobacco was not associated with past-month recreational substance use. Conclusions. Results indicate that the associations between cultural factors and substance use vary across substances. Future research should identify cultural factors that protect AIAN adolescents against use of newer products such as e-cigarettes and blunts.

Objectives: The primary aim of the study was to examine the relationship between child maltreatment and cigarette smoking trajectories. Methods: Latent class growth analysis and multinomial logistic regression were performed on 903 youth drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Results: Three distinct classes of cigarette smoking trajectories were identified: (1) Stable no/low cigarette use (61%); (2) Gradually increasing cigarette use (30%); and (3) Sharply increasing cigarette use (9%). Physical abuse during early childhood and adolescence predicted membership in the sharply increasing cigarette use class. Neglect during early childhood predicted membership in the gradually increasing cigarette use class. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions for adolescent cigarette smoking should integrate trauma-informed approaches. Further, the results highlight early childhood and adolescence as particularly vulnerable periods with respect to the influence of physical abuse and neglect on cigarette smoking, pointing to the need for additional maltreatment prevention efforts during these developmental stages.

The three objectives of the present study were to clarify how these systems are organized and interact, to examine whether their involvement in maintenance changes with aging, and to identify which underlying mechanism accounts for both age-related changes in the available set of mechanisms and immediate recall. Methods: To address these issues, we examined age-related changes in strategic aspects of maintenance of information in working memory. We collected trial-by-trial verbal reports of which strategy young and older adults used while accomplishing a verbal complex span task. In addition, individuals' speed of articulation was collected. Results: Results support the existence of separable systems (i.e., phonological and semantic systems) that participants combine to cope with increasing memory loads. We also found age-related differences (e.g., older individuals used more strategies than young individuals and used available strategies unequally often) and invariance (e.g., both age groups used strategies based on phonological and semantic processing) in strategic aspects of working memory maintenance. Importantly, articulation speed accounted for effects of both memory load and age on strategy distributions as well as for age-related differences in immediate recall. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that young and older adults' use of common and different sets of maintenance mechanisms stems for the constraints of the phonological loop in working memory, especially the speed of articulation, which slowed down with aging.

Controlling Unpleasant Thoughts: Adjustments of Cognitive Control Based on Previous-Trial Load in a Working Memory Task								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						469	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00469			JAN 24 2020	2020	Dynamic cognitive control adjustments are important for integrating thoughts and actions that take place during dynamic changes of environmental demands and support goal-directed behavior. We investigated, in a working memory (WM) paradigm, whether dynamic adjustments in cognitive control based on previous trial load influence the neural response to neutral or unpleasant distracters. We also investigated whether individual self-reported abilities in controlling thoughts influence this effect. Participants performed a WM change detection task with low or high WM-related cognitive demands. An unpleasant or a neutral distractive image was presented at the beginning of each trial, prior to the WM task. We tested for control adjustments that were associated with the load level of the preceding trial task (N-1) on the neural response to the subsequent distractive image. We found an effect of the prior WM task load on a parieto-occipital waveform event-related potential (ERP) that appeared between 200 and 300 ms after the neutral distracter onset. This effect was not observed for the unpleasant distracter. Individual ability for controlling thoughts may influence the effect of cognitive control adjustments on distracter processing during the unpleasant condition. These findings provide evidence that: (1) dynamic cognitive control adjustments are impaired by unpleasant distracters; and (2) the ability to control unpleasant thoughts is linked to individual differences in flexible cognitive control adjustments and shielding of WM representations from unpleasant distracters.

Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Test a Network Model of Perceptual Decision Making in the Human Brain; Spatio-temporally specific transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the locus of perceptual decision making in the human brain								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE; FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				14						4	10.3389/fnhum.2020.00004			JAN 24 2020	2020	Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): -200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at -200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing.

Such a mental representation is known as a "cognitive map" and is formed as individuals familiarize themselves with the surrounding, providing detailed information about salient environmental landmarks and their spatial relationships. Despite evidence of the malleability and potential for training spatial orientation skills in humans, it remains unknown if the specific ability to form cognitive maps can be improved by an appositely developed training program. Here, we present a newly developed computerized 12-days training program in a virtual environment designed specifically to stimulate the acquisition of this important skill. We asked 15 healthy volunteers to complete the training program and perform a comprehensive spatial behavioral assessment before and after the training. We asked participants to become familiar with the environment by navigating a small area before slowly building them up to navigate within the larger and more complex environment; we asked them to travel back and forth between environmental landmarks until they had built an understanding of where those landmarks resided with respect to one another. This process repeated until participants had visited every landmark in the virtual town and had learned where each landmark resided with respect to the others. The results of this study confirmed the feasibility of the training program and suggested an improvement in the ability of participants to form mental representations of the spatial surrounding. This study provides preliminary findings on the feasibility of a 12-days program in training spatial orientation skills. We discuss the utility and potential impact of this training program in the lives of the many individuals affected by topographical disorientation as a result of an acquired or developmental condition.

Saccade Latency Provides Evidence for Reduced Face Inversion Effects With Higher Autism Traits								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						470	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00470			JAN 24 2020	2020	Individuals on the autism spectrum are reported to show impairments in the processing of social information, including aspects of eye-movements towards faces. Abnormalities in basic-level visual processing are also reported. In the current study, we sought to determine if the latency of saccades made towards social targets (faces) in a natural scene as opposed to inanimate targets (cars) would be related to sub-clinical autism traits (ATs) in individuals drawn from a neurotypical population. The effect of stimulus inversion was also examined given that difficulties with processing inverted faces are thought to be a function of face expertise. No group differences in saccadic latency were established for face or car targets, regardless of image orientation. However, as expected, we found that individuals with higher autism-like traits did not demonstrate a saccadic face inversion effect, but those with lower autism-like traits did. Neither group showed a car inversion effect. Thus, these results suggest that neurotypical individuals with high autism-like traits also show anomalies in detecting and orienting to faces. In particular, the reduced saccadic face inversion effect established in these participants with high ATs suggests that speed of visual processing and orienting towards faces may be associated with the social difficulties found across the broader autism spectrum.

Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the association of total physical activity (PA) and its different domains, as well as sedentary behavior with sarcopenia and SO in older adults with the incidence of clinical factors. Methods: Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), handgrip strength by dynamometer, physical function by physical tests, and PA and sedentary behavior were self-reported. Results: Older adults with low gait speed (HR = 5.99, 95%CI = 2.07-17.24 and HR = 4.44, 95%CI = 1.37-14.41) and insufficiently active in the occupational domain presented a higher risk of sarcopenia, independent of others PA domains, total PA and sedentary behavior.

Walking and counting dual-task (DT) measures are strongly associated with cognitive impairment and dementia and this preliminary study investigates whether performance on DT walking and counting tasks are associated with cognitive function and disability in 125 participants who sustained a SHI on average 26 years before. Single Task (ST) walking (speed over 6 metres) and ST counting (Serial 3s) and DT performance of concurrent walking and Serial 3s were compared with neuropsychological, wellbeing and disability tests for strength of association. The strongest correlations were between ST Correct Cognitive Responses (CCRs) and MMSE (rho = 0.435), DT CCRs and Short-term Memory Binding Tests (STMBT) binding accuracy (rho = 0,409) and DT CCRs and STROOP (rho = 0.420), but associations were less strong with disability. Developing this test, as a cost-efficient screening tool for triage to onward referral for neuropsychological assessment, holds promise, but requires further research.

Virtual Reality Analgesia With Interactive Eye Tracking During Brief Thermal Pain Stimuli: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Crossover Design)								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						467	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00467			JAN 23 2020	2020	In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures. However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via "hands free" eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing pain during brief thermal pain stimuli. Method Forty eight healthy volunteers participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus, participants provided subjective 0-10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain stimulus. Results As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition, participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p < 0.001) and pain unpleasantness (p < 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger illusion of presence (p < 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p < 0.001) during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.

EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH				46	2			128	138		10.1080/0361073X.2020.1716153			MAR 14 2020	2020	Background: Older and younger adults utilize sensory information differently to plan and control their reaching movements to visual targets. In addition, younger adults appear to utilize different sensorimotor transformations when reaching to somatosensory vs. visual targets. Critically, it is not yet known if older adults perform similar sensorimotor transformations when planning and executing movements to targets of varying modalities (i.e., visual, somatosensory or bimodal). Methods: Participants (12 younger adults, mean age: 22; 12 older adults, mean age: 67) performed reaches with their right upper-limb to visual, somatosensory, and bimodal (i.e., visual-somatosensory) targets in a dark room. Data were ultimately analyzed using a 2 Age-Group by 3-Target Modality ANOVA. Results: For both age groups, endpoint precision was best when the visual target was presented (i.e., visual or bimodal). Critically, older adults exhibited longer reaction time (RT) compared to younger adults, especially when initiating reaches to the somatosensory targets (Cohen's d = 0.95). These longer RT's for older adults when aiming to somatosensory targets may indicate that aging leads to deficits in performing the sensorimotor transformations necessary to plan a reaching movement toward somatosensory targets. In contrast, control mechanisms during reaching execution appear to be comparable for both younger and older adults. Conclusions: When performing a voluntary movement to a felt vs. a seen target location, older adults appear to have altered planning mechanisms, compared to younger adults. Specifically, they tend to take more time to complete the necessary sensorimotor transformations to locate a somatosensory target. These findings could be used to guide the design of physical activity and rehabilitation protocols.

To inform strategies for reducing the PO epidemic, research is needed on the sources of misused POs and their association with POUD. Methods: Past-year PO misusers aged >= 12 (N = 6033) from the 2015 to 2016 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health were analyzed. The most recent source of misused POs was assessed. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between the sources of misused POs and past-year POUD. All analyses were stratified by age groups for each sex. Results: Overall, the most common sources of misused POs were obtaining from friends/relatives for free (40.27%) and physicians (36.59%). Males had a higher prevalence of buying POs from friends/relatives or drug dealers/strangers than females. Significant age differences also emerged. Buying POs from drug dealers/strangers (vs. obtaining POs free from friends/relatives) was strong predictor of past-year POUD in both sexes. In the sex- and age-stratified analyses, significant associations of past-year POUD with (1) buying from drug dealers/strangers emerged among males aged 18+ and females aged 26+; (2) buying from friends/relatives emerged among males aged 12+ and females aged 18-25; (3) obtaining from physicians emerged among males aged 18+ and females aged 26+. Conclusions: Our findings indicate different risk profiles for POUD across sex and age groups with different diversion sources. Prevention and treatment programs for POUD should be tailored to consider sex and developmental age differences in sources of opioids.

Barriers to Quitting Areca Nut Consumption and Joining a Cessation Program as Perceived by Chewer and Nonchewer Populations in Guam								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	6			947	953		10.1080/10826084.2020.1716012			APR 1 2020	2020	Background: Areca nut (AN) is a carcinogenic substance consumed by roughly 600 million individuals worldwide with increasing popularity in Guam. In response, a cessation program was developed and implemented in Guam and Saipan. However, to improve its delivery, it is necessary to understand the reasons influencing recruitment and participation, such as why a chewer may not want to quit or join a cessation program. Objective: To explore barriers inhibiting chewers from quitting AN chewing and from participating in a cessation program. Methods: Nine individual and group discussions were facilitated with a convenience sample of 17 chewers and nonchewers in Guam in 2017. The mean age of the participants was 36.4 years. Recurring themes relating to reasons for not quitting and not joining a cessation program were extracted. Results: Results produced three general categories-Sociocultural, Behavioral, and Accessible. Each category encompasses different attributes concerning reasons not to quit chewing (e.g. addiction, enabling community, or belief that AN is harmless), and reasons influencing lack of participation in a cessation program (e.g. time, transportation, or relatability). Conclusions: Current findings suggest chewers are unaware of the harmful effects of AN. Also, they may not comprehend the purpose of a cessation program. In addition, the likelihood of chewers participating in a cessation program is influenced by their level of comfort with the program and personnel, and whether a program addresses their time and transportation limitations.

There are a number of feature metrics for functional brain states, such as functional connectivity, graph theoretical metrics, and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF). It is necessary to choose appropriate metrics and also to specify the region of interests (ROIs) from a number of brain regions. Here, we use a Tucker3 clustering method, which simultaneously selects the feature vectors (graph theoretical metrics and fractional ALFF) and the ROIs that can discriminate between resting and meditative states based on the characteristics of the given data. In this study, breath-counting meditation, one of the most popular forms of focused-attention meditation, was used and brain activities during resting and meditation states were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicated that the clustering coefficients of the eight brain regions, Frontal Inf Oper L, Occipital Inf R, ParaHippocampal R, Cerebellum 10 R, Cingulum Mid R, Cerebellum Crus1 L, Occipital Inf L, and Paracentral Lobule R increased through the meditation. Our study also provided the framework of data-driven brain functional analysis and confirmed its effectiveness on analyzing neural basis of focused-attention meditation.

J	Yang, Yuan; Chen, Tingting; Shao, Mingming; Yan, Shoufu; Yue, Guang H.; Jiang, Changhao								Effects of Tai Chi Chuan on Inhibitory Control in Elderly Women: An fNIRS Study								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						476	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00476			JAN 22 2020	2020	Background Inhibitory control is a sub-ability of executive function and plays an important role in the entire cognitive process. However, declines in inhibitory control during aging significantly impair the quality of life of elderly people. Investigating methods to delay the decline of inhibitory control has become a focal point in current research. Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) is one effective method used to delay cognitive declines in older adults. However, the specific effects of TCC on inhibitory control and the mechanisms through which TCC may improve cognition in older adults have not been comprehensively investigated. Objective The study explores possible neurological mechanisms related to the effects of TCC interventions on inhibitory control in older people using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique and reaction times (RTs). Methods A total of 26 healthy, elderly people who had not received TCC training completed all study procedures. The subjects were randomized to either the TCC group or the control group. Subjects in the TCC group were taught TCC by a certified instructor and trained for 8 weeks. The control group continued to perform general daily activities. The Flanker task was administered to every participant to evaluate inhibitory control pre- and post-intervention. While participants were performing the Flanker task, fNIRS data were collected. Results Post-intervention, significant differences for incongruent flankers were found only for the TCC intervention group. Faster RTs were observed for the incongruent flankers in the TCC group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Analysis of the fNIRS data revealed an increase in oxy-Hb in the prefrontal cortex during the incongruent flankers after the TCC exercise intervention. Conclusion The TCC intervention significantly improved inhibitory control in older adults, suggesting that TCC is an effective, suitable exercise for improving executive function and neurological health in elderly people.

J	Gooderham, G. Kyle; Ho, Simon; Handy, Todd C.								Variability in Executive Control Performance Is Predicted by Physical Activity								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						463	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00463			JAN 21 2020	2020	Physical activity (PA) promotes neurogenesis and has neuroprotective effects on the brain, bolstering the structural and functional resources necessary for improved cognitive functioning. Intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive performance is linked to neuropsychological structure and functional ability. Despite evidence of the neurogenerative and neuroprotective effects of PA, limited investigation into the link between PA and IIV has been conducted. Across three studies we investigate the effect of PA on IIV in reaction time (RT) on three modified Flanker Tasks. The International PA Questionnaire was used to evaluate PA while the Attention Network Test (ANT) and two additional modified Flanker Tasks were used to assess executive control and attentional performance. RT coefficients of variation (RTCV) were calculated for each participant by dividing the standard deviation by the mean RT for each stimuli condition. Analysis revealed that basic RT was not associated with PA nor was PA predictive of IIV on the modified Flanker Tasks. However, three consistent findings emerged from analysis of the ANT. First, RTCV and moderate PA were positively related, such that more self-reported moderate PA was associated with greater IIV. Conversely, RTCV and vigorous PA were negatively related. Finally, when controlling for the effects of PA on IIV in young adults, variability decreases as age increases. In sum, PA is predictive of IIV on attentional and executive control tasks in young adults, though only at particular intensities and on certain tasks, indicating that task type and cognitive load are important determinants of the relationship between PA and cognitive performance. These findings are consistent with prior literature that suggests that the role of PA in young adults is reliant on specific interventions and measures in order to detect effects more readily found in adolescent and aging populations.

Many previous studies have used tactile stimulation to conduct psychological and psychophysiological experiments. However, most of these studies used solid material, not water stream, as an experimental stimulus. To investigate water perception, or to easily control the temperature of an experimental stimulus, it is important to be able to control the water stimulus. In this study, we investigated the usability of water as an experimental stimulus for electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and report the basic EEG response to water stimulus. We developed a tactile stimulation device using a water stream to study EEG responses, with the ability to control the stimulus onset timing. As stimuli, we selected two types of water stream, normal and soft, based on a psychological experiment to confirm a difference of subjective feeling induced by these water streams. We conducted a typical oddball task using the two different water streams and recorded EEG waveforms from 64 electrodes while participants touched the water streams. We calculated P300 at the Pz electrode, alpha asymmetry at the frontal electrodes, and alpha suppression at the parietal area. As a result, we observed typical P300 differentiation based on the stimulus proportion (target 20% and standard 80%). We observed a weaker alpha suppression when participants touched the soft water stream compared to the normal shower. These results demonstrate the usability of water stream in psychophysiological studies and suggested that alpha suppression could be a candidate to evaluate comfort of water stream.

In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT.

Attentional saliency and ingroup biases: From society to the brain								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	3			324	333		10.1080/17470919.2020.1716070			MAY 3 2020	2020	There is ample evidence demonstrating intergroup biases on cognition and emotion. However, it remains unclear how exactly group identification influences these processes, with issues of context sensitivity and goal dependence remaining open to scrutiny. Providing a range of interdisciplinary material, the current review attempts to inform understanding of these issues. Specifically, we provide evidence revealing that individuals show enhanced attention for stimuli associated with an ingroup compared to an outgroup. At the attentional level, such biases can be explained by the assignment of different levels of saliency to ingroup versus outgroup targets. Critically, however, salience assignment is not fixed but varies as a function of context and goal-directed behavior. We suggest that the network in the brain previously associated with social and emotional saliency and attention - notably the anterior insula, posterior superior temporal sulcus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - underpins these effects. Moreover, although attention typically favors ingroup targets, outgroup members can be prioritized on occasion. The implications of this viewpoint and future lines of investigation are considered.

In the present study, we examined the effectiveness of three interventions for learning a bimanual coordination task: Virtual reality training (VRT), conventional physical training (CPT), and the combination of VRT and CPT (COMB). A total of 45 women with MS were randomly assigned to one of the following study conditions: VRT, CPT or COMB. Bimanual coordination was assessed at baseline, eight weeks later at study completion, and 4 weeks after that at follow-up. Bimanual coordination improved over time from baseline to study completion and to follow-up. Compared to the VRT and CPT conditions, the COMB condition led to higher coordination accuracy and consistency. The combination thus appears to have the potential to speed up the recovery of motor control and rehabilitation of women with MS.

The human emotional reaction felt toward a material is estimated through (i) explicit measurements, using a questionnaire collecting valence and intensity, and (ii) implicit measurements of the activity of the autonomic nervous system, via a pupillometry equipment. A panel of 25 university students (13 women, 12 men), aged from 18 to 27, tested blind twelve materials such as polymers, sandpapers, wood, velvet and fur, randomly ordered. After measuring the initial pupil diameter, taken as a reference, its variation during the tactile exploration was recorded. After each touch, the participants were asked to quantify the emotional value of the material. The results show that the pupil size variation follows the emotional intensity. It is significantly larger during the touch of materials considered as pleasant or unpleasant, than with the touch of neutral materials. Moreover, after a time period of about 0.5 s following the stimulus, the results reveal significant differences between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, as well as differences according to gender, i.e., higher pupil dilatation of women than men. These results suggest (i) that the autonomic nervous system is initially sensitive to high arousing stimulation, and (ii) that, after a certain period, the pupil size changes according to the cognitive interest induced and the emotional regulation adopted. This research shows the interest of the emotional characterization of materials for product design.

Platelets are a copious source of growth factors, most of which display also the neurotropic activity. On this basis, we investigated behavioral and cognitive consequences of the administration of intravenous allogeneic platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in senescent mice. Methods: The animals (16-18 months old) were injected with either physiological saline or PRP which was acquired from age-matched counterparts and subjected to a battery of tests comprised of open-field, elevated-plus maze, tail suspension, and Morris water maze test. Results: We found that PRP treatment increases locomotion and improves learning and memory in elderly mice. Importantly, the PRP-treated animals did not exhibit any anxiety- or depression-like behaviors. Conclusion: The present study is the first to demonstrate that allogeneic PRP possesses beneficial effects against cognitive aging and it signifies that PRP may be used as a novel self-sourced treatment in age-related cognitive decline.

Methods: Among various socio-demographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics, height, weight, waist circumference (WC), Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) and WHtR of the Greek participants, over 50 years old, enrolled in the ATTICA (n = 1,128) and the MEDIS (n = 2,221) in relation to SA; SA was evaluated using the validated Successful Aging Index (SAI, range 0-10) comprising of health-related, social, lifestyle, and clinical parameters. Results: WHtR was inversely associated with SAI with every 0.1-unit increase, lowering SAI by almost 0.5 units (b-coefficient +/- SE: -4.71 +/- 0.26; 95%CI: -5.21, -4.20). Also, WHtR was more strongly associated with SAI (b = -0.352), surpassing the effect of age and sex (b = -0.347 and 0.11, respectively). With respect to the other anthropometric indices (weight, height, WC, WHR), WHtR exhibited the highest explanatory ability (Adjusted R-2 = 0.345); the higher the adjusted R-2 the higher explanatory ability. Conclusions: WHtR was revealed as the best determinant of successful aging, with respect to other anthropometric indices (weight, height, WC, WHR). The present findings are of significant public health importance for better understanding the role of body mass distribution on the aging process.

Based on the Culture-Behavior-Brain-Loop Model and the recent finding of associations between the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR, rs53576) and a cultural trait (i.e., interdependence) across populations, we tested the hypothesis that resting-state brain network properties mediate the relationship between OXTR rs53576 and interdependence. G and A allele carriers of OXTR rs53576 were scanned during a resting state using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and completed questionnaires to estimate their interdependence cultural values. We identified significant genotype effects on the local network metrics of the right hippocampus and its functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, basal ganglia and thalamus. The local network metrics of the right hippocampus and its functional connectivity with the basal ganglia and thalamus were correlated with interdependence. Moreover, both the degree of the right hippocampus and its functional connectivity with the basal ganglia and thalamus mediated the relationship between OXTR and interdependence. Our results provide brain imaging evidence for a key function of the brain in mediating the relationship between genes and culture.

Studying this association becomes a vital area of research for promoting aging-well. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between HRQoL and HGS among community-dwelling older adults above 60 years old. Methods: Participants comprised of 176 older adults (mean age: 68.15 +/- 6.74). The HGS was tested with Jamar (R) Dynamometer, and the EuroQuol-5 Dimensions 5Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire was used to assess HRQoL. Results: Both HGS and HRQoL were negatively correlated with age (p < .001). Lower values of HGS and HRQoL were recorded among older adults who had diagnosed with one or more chronic diseases (p < .001). Significant correlations were recorded between HGS and functioning, and subjective well-being domains of EQ-5D-5L. A relatively higher association was recorded between the functioning variables of EQ-5D-5L and HGS compared to subjective well- being variables. Conclusion: Handgrip strength is a simple and practical measure in identifying older adults at risk of physical decline. Maintaining handgrip strength may contribute to improving HRQoL, and can add an imperative dimension to promote aging-well in older adults >= 60 years old.

Neuroinflammation and White Matter Alterations in Obesity Assessed by Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						464	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00464			JAN 14 2020	2020	Human obesity is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, alterations in brain structure and function, and cognitive impairment. Rodent models of obesity show that high-calorie diets cause brain inflammation (neuroinflammation) in multiple regions, including the hippocampus, and impairments in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. To determine if similar effects exist in humans with obesity, we applied Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) to evaluate neuroinflammation and axonal integrity. We examined diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in two independent cohorts of obese and non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: 25 obese/21 non-obese; Cohort 2: 18 obese/41 non-obese). We applied Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to allow whole-brain white matter (WM) analyses and compare DBSI-derived isotropic and anisotropic diffusion measures between the obese and non-obese groups. In both cohorts, the obese group had significantly greater DBSI-derived restricted fraction (DBSI-RF; an indicator of neuroinflammation-related cellularity), and significantly lower DBSI-derived fiber fraction (DBSI-FF; an indicator of apparent axonal density) in several WM tracts (all corrected p < 0.05). Moreover, using region of interest analyses, average DBSI-RF and DBSI-FF values in the hippocampus were significantly greater and lower, respectively, in obese relative to non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: p = 0.045; Cohort 2: p = 0.008). Hippocampal DBSI-FF and DBSI-RF and amygdalar DBSI-FF metrics related to cognitive performance in Cohort 2. In conclusion, these findings suggest that greater neuroinflammation-related cellularity and lower apparent axonal density are associated with human obesity and cognitive performance. Future studies are warranted to determine a potential role for neuroinflammation in obesity-related cognitive impairment.

Short-Term Classification Learning Promotes Rapid Global Improvements of Information Processing in Human Brain Functional Connectome								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						462	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00462			JAN 14 2020	2020	Classification learning is a preeminent human ability within the animal kingdom but the key mechanisms of brain networks regulating learning remain mostly elusive. Recent neuroimaging advancements have depicted human brain as a complex graph machinery where brain regions are nodes and coherent activities among them represent the functional connections. While long-term motor memories have been found to alter functional connectivity in the resting human brain, a graph topological investigation of the short-time effects of learning are still not widely investigated. For instance, classification learning is known to orchestrate rapid modulation of diverse memory systems like short-term and visual working memories but how the brain functional connectome accommodates such modulations is unclear. We used publicly available repositories (openfmri.org) selecting three experiments, two focused on short-term classification learning along two consecutive runs where learning was promoted by trial-by-trial feedback errors, while a further experiment was used as supplementary control. We analyzed the functional connectivity extracted from BOLD fMRI signals, and estimated the graph information processing in the cerebral networks. The information processing capability, characterized by complex network statistics, significantly improved over runs, together with the subject classification accuracy. Instead,null-learning experiments, where feedbacks came with poor consistency, did not provoke any significant change in the functional connectivity over runs. We propose that learning induces fast modifications in the overall brain network dynamics, definitely ameliorating the short-term potential of the brain to process and integrate information, a dynamic consistently orchestrated by modulations of the functional connections among specific brain regions.

J	Aidman, Eugene								Cognitive Fitness Framework: Towards Assessing, Training and Augmenting Individual-Difference Factors Underpinning High-Performance Cognition								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						466	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00466			JAN 14 2020	2020	The aim of this article is to introduce the concept of Cognitive Fitness (CF), identify its key ingredients underpinning both real-time task performance and career longevity in high-risk occupations, and to canvas a holistic framework for their assessment, training, and augmentation. CF as a capacity to deploy neurocognitive resources, knowledge and skills to meet the demands of operational task performance, is likely to be multi-faceted and differentially malleable. A taxonomy of CF constructs derived from Cognitive Readiness (CR) and Mental fitness (MF) literature maps into phases of operational cycle from foundational to advanced, mission-ready and recovery. Foundational cognitive attributes, such as attention, executive control and co-action, were hypothesized to be trainable at the initial Cognitive Gym phase. More advanced training targets at the CR phase included stress and arousal regulation, adaptability, teamwork, situation awareness (including detection, sense-making and prediction) and decision making (de-biasing and confidence calibration). The mission-ready training phase is focused on tolerances (to sleep loss, monotony, pain, frustration, uncertainty) and resistance (to distraction, deception or manipulation). Operational Augmentation phase relies on support tools such as decision aids and fatigue countermeasures, while the Recovery phase employs reflexive (e.g., mindfulness), and restorative practices (e.g., nutrition and sleep hygiene). The periodization of cognitive training in this cycle is hypothesized to optimize both real-time cognitive performance and the resilience that enables life-long thriving. One of the most promising avenues of validating this hypothesis is by developing an expert consensus on the key CF ingredients and their relative importance in high-performance settings.

Cross-Situational Statistical Learning of New Words Despite Bilateral Hippocampal Damage and Severe Amnesia								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						448	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00448			JAN 14 2020	2020	Word learning requires learners to bind together arbitrarily-related phonological, visual, and conceptual information. Prior work suggests that this binding can be robustly achieved via incidental cross-situational statistical exposure to words and referents. When cross-situational statistical learning (CSSL) is tested in the laboratory, there is no information on any given trial to identify the referent of a novel word. However, by tracking which objects co-occur with each word across trials, learners may acquire mappings through statistical association. While CSSL behavior is well-characterized, its brain correlates are not. The arbitrary nature of CSSL mappings suggests hippocampal involvement, but the incremental, statistical nature of the learning raises the possibility of neocortical or procedural learning systems. Prior studies have shown that neurological patients with hippocampal pathology have word-learning impairments, but this has not been tested in a statistical learning paradigm. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test whether patients with bilateral hippocampal pathology (N = 3) could learn new words in a CSSL paradigm. In the task, patients and healthy comparison participants completed a CSSL word-learning task in which they acquired eight word/object mappings. During each trial of the CSSL task, participants saw two objects on a computer display, heard one novel word, and selected the most likely referent. Across trials, words were 100% likely to co-occur with their referent, but only 14.3% likely with non-referents. Two of three amnesic patients learned the associations between objects and word forms, although performance was impaired relative to healthy comparison participants. Our findings show that the hippocampus is not strictly necessary for CSSL for words, although it may facilitate such learning. This is consistent with a hybrid account of CSSL supported by implicit and explicit memory systems, and may have translational applications for remediation of (word-) learning deficits in neurological populations with hippocampal pathology.

Whether dual use facilitates or inhibits smoking cessation is of concern, yet limited information exists regarding continuation of dual use over time. Purpose: This study examined variation in nicotine product use over a one-year period, and evaluated predictors of smoking abstinence among dual users. Methods: Data from 1,082 dual users of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes were analyzed using Wave 1 (2013-2014) and Wave 2 (2014-2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. Descriptive analyses assessed variation in nicotine product use at Wave 2. Weighted logistic regression was used to identify correlates of smoking abstinence. Results: The majority of Wave 1 dual users (88.5%) continued using combustible tobacco at Wave 2: 59.2% were exclusive cigarette smokers, 25.5% remained dual users, and 3.8% reported some other combustible tobacco use pattern. The odds of being smoke-free at Wave 2 were higher among dual users who reported everyday (versus someday) e-cigarette use (aOR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.18-2.89). Everyday use of tobacco cigarettes was inversely associated with smoking abstinence (aOR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.21-0.51). Conclusions: Over a one year period, most dual users still smoked tobacco cigarettes. Frequency of cigarette and e-cigarette use at Wave 1 were each associated with odds of smoking abstinence. Findings suggest that daily e-cigarette use may increase dual users' chances of becoming smoke free.

Strategic information, including estimates of the total number of patients chronically-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the size of key populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID), is critical to informing these efforts. For Malaysia, the estimate of the PWID population size most frequently reported in global systematic reviews is for the year 2009. Objectives: To support ongoing national HCV planning efforts, we aimed to estimate the national population size of active PWID in Malaysia, for the years 2014 and 2017. Methods: To estimate the PWID population size, we applied standard benchmark-multiplier methodology, frequently used for PWID population size estimation, and extended it by adjusting for cessation of injecting drug use within the benchmark and calculating statistical uncertainty intervals. Results: The estimated active PWID population size was 153,000 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 136,000-172,000) for 2014 and 156,000 (95% UI: 137,000-188,000) for 2017. Conclusions/importance: This updated estimate of the active PWID population size in Malaysia will help inform effective planning for the scale-up of HCV screening and treatment services. The proposed methodology is applicable to other countries that maintain national HIV registries and have conducted Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveys among active PWID.

The acceptance and outcomes of autonomous self-tracking and self-governance as key elements for behavior change are under-researched. Purpose/Objectives: The objective of the study was to conduct a quality assessment of design and content features of self-tracking smartphone applications related to alcohol use, available in German, Italian, or French. Methods: A total of 25 self-tracking applications were identified, of which 17 could be assessed with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), the System Usability Scale (SUS), and an additional content quality checklist based on the theoretical self-change framework (n = 13). Results: The scale design analysis showed a rather positive picture. Using the SUS, only six cases were below the reference average (x = 68), and three were clearly above average. Application of the MARS showed higher scores among the self-tracking applications in this study than among the health applications reviewed in the original MARS study. Better design quality goes together with better basic content quality. However, a closer look at the "interactivity scores" and the "risk/information barometer," as well as at the individual subtopics of the 10-point content checklist revealed major shortcomings. Conclusions/Importance: Improvements are necessary for consumer information in app stores, increased availability of alcohol-related self-tracking applications, transparent quality assurance regarding evidence-based content, and user-friendly design quality, to provide guidance for potential users on how to successfully navigate a highly unstable digital environment.

However, much remains to be learned regarding the precise manner how these deficits contribute to disrupting both speech and cognitive functions in those who stutter. Herein, we examine the suitability of electroencephalographic (EEG) mu rhythms for addressing these deficits. We review some previous findings of mu rhythm activity differentiating stuttering from non-stuttering individuals and present some new preliminary findings capturing stuttering-related deficits in working memory. Mu rhythms are characterized by spectral peaks in alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-25 Hz) frequency bands (mu-alpha and mu-beta). They emanate from premotor/motor regions and are influenced by basal ganglia and sensorimotor function. More specifically, alpha peaks (mu-alpha) are sensitive to basal ganglia-based inhibitory signals and sensory-to-motor feedback. Beta peaks (mu-beta) are sensitive to changes in timing and capture motor-to-sensory (i.e., forward model) projections. Observing simultaneous changes in mu-alpha and mu-beta across the time-course of specific events provides a rich window for observing neurophysiological deficits associated with stuttering in both speech and cognitive tasks and can provide a better understanding of the functional relationship between these stuttering symptoms. We review how independent component analysis (ICA) can extract mu rhythms from raw EEG signals in speech production tasks, such that changes in alpha and beta power are mapped to myogenic activity from articulators. We review findings from speech production and auditory discrimination tasks demonstrating that mu-alpha and mu-beta are highly sensitive to capturing sensorimotor and basal ganglia deficits associated with stuttering with high temporal precision. Novel findings from a non-word repetition (working memory) task are also included. They show reduced mu-alpha suppression in a stuttering group compared to a typically fluent group. Finally, we review current limitations and directions for future research.

Using this methodology, the present work aims to detect differential attentional processing of ingroup and outgroup members based on gender categories. Specifically, three EEG studies tested how factors that enhance social identity relevance, namely gender identification and contextual salience of gender representation, moderate neural gender categorization effects. Study 1 showed that both women (Study 1a) and men (Study 1b) were more likely to show preferential attention to ingroup over outgroup members, but only when they identified strongly with their gender group. Study 2 showed that when gender categories in an intergroup leadership context were made salient (i.e., when women were numerically underrepresented versus equally represented compared to men), women, irrespective of their level of gender identification, showed preferential attention to ingroup over outgroup members. Together, this work provides empirical evidence for (1) the neural gender categorization effect among both men and women as soon as 100 ms after face perception and (2) the moderating role of factors that enhance social identity relevance in early gender categorization.

Knowledge about the relationships among cognitive functions is informative not only for basic neuroscientific research but also for clinical applications and developments of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. In the present study, we propose an exhaustive data mining approach to reveal relationships among cognitive functions based on functional brain mapping and network analysis. We began our analysis with 109 pseudo-activation maps (cognitive function maps; CFM) that were reconstructed from a functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analysis database, each of which corresponds to one of 109 cognitive functions such as 'emotion,' 'attention,' 'episodic memory,' etc. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity between the CFMs, we mapped the cognitive functions onto a two-dimensional space where the relevant functions were located close to each other, which provided a rough picture of the brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis of cognitive functions using clustering of voxels in each CFM connected to the other 108 CFMs with various strengths. As a result, a CFM for each cognitive function was subdivided into several parts, each of which is strongly associated with some CFMs for a subset of the other cognitive functions, which brought in sub-concepts (i.e., sub-functions) of the cognitive function. Moreover, we conducted network analysis for the network whose nodes were parcels derived from whole-brain parcellation based on the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities. Since each parcel is characterized by associations with the 109 cognitive functions, network analyses using them are expected to inform about relationships between cognitive and network characteristics. Indeed, we found that informational diversities of interaction between parcels and densities of local connectivity were dependent on the kinds of associated functions. In addition, we identified the homogeneous and inhomogeneous network communities about the associated functions. Altogether, we suggested the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions.

Contact Heat Evoked Potentials Are Responsive to Peripheral Sensitization: Requisite Stimulation Parameters								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						459	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00459			JAN 10 2020	2020	The sensitizing effect of capsaicin has been previously characterized using laser and contact heat evoked potentials (LEPs and CHEPs) by stimulating in the primary area of hyperalgesia. Interestingly, only CHEPs reveal changes consistent with notion of peripheral sensitization (i.e., reduced latencies). The aim of this study was to investigate contact heat stimulation parameters necessary to detect peripheral sensitization related to the topical application of capsaicin, and therefore significantly improve the current method of measuring peripheral sensitization via CHEPs. Rapid contact heat stimulation (70 degrees C/s) was applied from three different baseline temperatures (35, 38.5, and 42 degrees C) to a 52 degrees C peak temperature, before and after the topical application of capsaicin on the hand dorsum. Increased pain ratings in the primary area of hyperalgesia were accompanied by reduced N2 latency. Changes in N2 latency were, however, only significant following stimulation from 35 and 38.5 degrees C baseline temperatures. These findings suggest that earlier recruitment of capsaicin-sensitized afferents occurs between 35 and 42 degrees C, as stimulations from 42 degrees C baseline were unchanged by capsaicin. This is in line with reduced thresholds of type II A-delta mechanoheat (AMH) nociceptors following sensitization. Conventional CHEP stimulation, with a baseline temperature below 42 degrees C, is well suited to objectively detect evidence of peripheral sensitization.

Contaminating Rubber Hands ("Multisensory Stimulation Therapy") to Treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				13						414	10.3389/fnhum.2019.00414			JAN 9 2020	2020	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a deeply enigmatic psychiatric condition associated with immense suffering worldwide. Efficacious therapies for OCD, like exposure and response prevention (ERP), are sometimes poorly tolerated by patients. As many as 25% of patients refuse to initiate ERP mainly because they are too anxious to follow exposure procedures. Accordingly, we proposed a simple and tolerable (immersive yet indirect) low-cost technique for treating OCD that we call "multisensory stimulation therapy." This method involves contaminating a rubber hand during the so-called "rubber hand illusion" (RHI) in which tactile sensations may be perceived as arising from a fake hand. Notably, Jalal et al. (2015) showed that such fake hand contamination during the RHI provokes powerful disgust reactions in healthy volunteers. In the current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of this novel approach. OCD patients (n = 29) watched as their hidden real hand was being stroked together with a visible fake hand; either synchronously (inducing the RHI; i.e., the experimental condition; n = 16) or asynchronously (i.e., the control condition; n = 13). After 5 min of tactile stimulation, the rubber hand was contaminated with fake feces, simulating conventional exposure therapy. Intriguingly, results suggested sensory assimilation of contamination sensations into the body image via the RHI: patients undergoing synchronous stimulation did not report greater contamination sensations when the fake hand was initially contaminated relative to asynchronous stroking. But contrary to expectations, they did so after the rubber hand had been contaminated for 5 min, as assessed via disgust facial expressions (a secondary outcome) and in vivo exposure (upon discontinuing the illusion). Further, to our surprise, synchronous and asynchronous stroking induced an equally vivid and fast-emerging illusion, which helps explain why both conditions initially (5 min after initiating tactile stimulation) provoked contamination reactions of equal magnitude. This study is the first to suggest heightened malleability of body image in OCD. Importantly, it may pave the way for a tolerable technique for the treatment of OCD-highly suitable for poorly resourced and emergency settings, including low-income and developing countries with minimal access to high-tech solutions like virtual reality.

The feedback-related negativity (FRN), a component of the event-related potential (ERP) that is sensitive to valenced feedback, is believed to reflect PE signals. Reinforcement is also studied using frontal midline theta (FM Theta) activity, which peaks around the same time as the FRN and increases in response to unexpected events compared to expected events. We recorded EEG while participants completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) task that included positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement conditions with multiple levels of the outcome, as well as control conditions that had no reinforcement value. Despite the overlap of FRN and FM Theta, these measures indexed dissociable cognitive processing. The FRN was sensitive to errors in both positive and negative reinforcement but not in control conditions, while frontal theta instead was sensitive to outcomes in positive reinforcement and control conditions, but not in negative reinforcement conditions. The FRN was sensitive to the point level of feedback in both positive and negative reinforcement, while FM Theta was not influenced by the feedback point level. Results are consistent with recent results indicating that the FRN is influenced by unsigned PEs (i.e., a salience signal). In contrast, we suggest that our findings for frontal theta are consistent with hypotheses suggesting that the neural generators of FM Theta are sensitive to both negative cues and the need for control.

However, the structure of CM is invisible on the standard T1- and T2-weighted (T1w and T2w) magnetic resonance images, which hamper it as a direct DBS target for clinical applications. The purpose of the current study is to demonstrate the use of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique to image the CM within the thalamic region. Twelve patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, or schizophrenia were included in this study. A 3D multi-echo gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence was acquired together with T1w and T2w images on a 3-T MR scanner. The QSM image was reconstructed from the GRE phase data. Direct visual inspection of the CM was made on T1w, T2w, and QSM images. Furthermore, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the CM to the adjacent posterior part of thalamus on T1w, T2w, and QSM images were compared using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. QSM dramatically improved the visualization of the CM nucleus. Clear delineation of CM compared to the surroundings was observed on QSM but not on T1w and T2w images. Statistical analysis showed that the CNR on QSM was significantly higher than those on T1w and T2w images. Taken together, our results indicate that QSM is a promising technique for improving the visualization of CM as a direct targeting for DBS surgery.

In total, 200 sentences written in Russian with varying emotional coloring were presented during the task, with half of the sentences containing a grammatical error that the participants were asked to identify. The EEG was recorded in age-matched control individuals (n = 17) and two groups of Samatha meditators with relatively short- (3-5 years' experience, n = 18) and long-term (10-30 years' experience, n = 18) practice experience. Task performance time (TPT) and accuracy of error detection (AED) were chosen as behavioral values. Amplitude, time latency and cortical distribution of P300 and P600 peaks of ERP were used as a value of speech-related brain activity. All statistical effects of meditation were estimated, controlling for age and sex. No behavioral differences between two groups of meditators were found. General TPT was shorter for both groups of meditators compared to the control group. Non-meditators reacted significantly slower to sentences about aggression than to sentences about anxiety or non-emotional sentences, whereas no significance was found between meditator groups. Non-meditators had better AED for the sentences about one-self than for the sentences about other people, whereas the meditators did not show any significant difference. The amplitude of P300 peak in frontal and left temporal scalp regions was higher for long-term meditators in comparison with both intermediate and control groups. The latency of P300 and P600 in left frontal and temporal regions positively correlated with TPT, whereas the amplitude of P300 in these regions had a negative correlation with TPT. We demonstrate that long-term meditation practice increases the ability of an individual to process negative emotional stimuli. The differences in behavioral reactions after onset of negative information that was self-related and non-self-related, which is typical for non-meditators, disappeared due to the influence of meditation. ERP results could be interpreted as a value of increase in voluntary control over emotional state during meditational practice.

Objectives: To gain deeper qualitative insight into high-level athlete PES usage; explore the variables leading them to escalate their PES use regimens; reveal PES experiences during their careers and, unlike other studies, not to focus exclusively on "doping" as measured by the use of WADA-banned substances. Methods: A macro life course-based framework from which the data could emerge through a thematic coding analysis was utilized. Sixteen narrative life course histories of recently retired high-performance athletes report on the factors impelling their escalation in PES use, including for some, the first use of banned PES. Results: Informant reports, thematically coded, reveal performance maximization urgency to be a central factor in escalating PES use, driven by four variables: Requirements, Opportunities, Influencers and Outcomes. These variables each comprise two key components that stimulate an urgency ecosystem affecting an athlete's proximity to an escalation threshold. Conclusions/Importance: Such a comprehensive investigation of PES use precipitants has not previously been undertaken. Advances in PES use were instantiated by a substantive, sometimes radical and often sudden increase in urgency to improve performance related to output requirements, specific demands, knowledge and access, timing windows, the competitive landscape, loyalty to coaches, efficiency expectations and likelihood of detection. This study informs incremental models of doping, the use of which is encouraged in order to analyze life course narratives to better understand athlete behaviors.		[Smith, Aaron C.

Objective: The main purpose of this study is to assess the association between accessibility of needle and syringe programs (NSP) and injecting and sharing risk behaviors. Methods: A cross-sectional study employed respondent-driving sampling (RDS) to recruit a sample of 634 people who inject drugs (PWID) from three provinces, Golestan, Ardabil, and Sistan and Baluchestan, in Iran between November 2018 and February 2019. Participants completed a questionnaire based on the WHO Drug Injecting Study Phase II survey. Results: Participants reported their accessibility of NSP services as low (6%), middle (19%), and high (75%) in the past 2 months at the time of the survey. PWID who had increased access to NSP services were less likely to report utilization of used cooker (aOR = 1.40; CI 95% 0.99-1.82), cotton (aOR = 1.30; CI 95% 0.79-1.81), and water (aOR = 1.07; CI 95% 0.89-1.26), receptive needle/syringe sharing (aOR= 1.86, 95% CI 1.69-2.03), and distributive needle/syringe sharing (aOR= 1.09, 95% CI 0.81-1.37). Conclusions/Importance: There is evidence of inequality in PWID's access to health care as they relate to the prevention of HCV transmission. An understanding of both the social determinants and prevention of injecting and sharing risk behaviors seeks to connect HCV risk reduction within the context of human rights and vulnerability.

Despite an emerging understanding of the role of OFC in memory and executive control, its necessity for core working memory (WM) operations remains undefined. Here, we assessed the impact of OFC damage on interference effects in WM using a Recent Probes task based on the Sternberg item-recognition task (1966). Subjects were asked to memorize a set of letters and then indicate whether a probe letter was presented in a particular set. Four conditions were created according to the forthcoming response ("yes"/"no") and the recency of the probe (presented in the previous trial set or not). We compared behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) responses between healthy subjects (n = 14) and patients with bilateral OFC damage (n = 14). Both groups had the same recency pattern of slower reaction time (RT) when the probe was presented in the previous trial but not in the current one, reflecting the proactive interference (PI). The within-group electrophysiological results showed no condition difference during letter encoding and maintenance. In contrast, event-related potentials (ERPs) to probes showed distinct within-group condition effects, and condition by group effects. The response and recency effects for controls occurred within the same time window (300-500 ms after probe onset) and were observed in two distinct spatial groups including right centro-posterior and left frontal electrodes. Both clusters showed ERP differences elicited by the response effect, and one cluster was also sensitive to the recency manipulation. Condition differences for the OFC group involved two different clusters, encompassing only left hemisphere electrodes and occurring during two consecutive time windows (345-463 ms and 565-710 ms). Both clusters were sensitive to the response effect, but no recency effect was found despite the behavioral recency effect. Although the groups had different electrophysiological responses, the maintenance of letters in WM, the evaluation of the context of the probe, and the decision to accept or reject a probed letter were preserved in OFC patients. The results suggest that neural reorganization may contribute to intact recency judgment and response after OFC damage.

Little is known about the loss felt by relatives of people with ABI. This study investigates concepts of loss among individuals with ABI and their families. Forty participants, recruited from a brain injury charity client pool, took part in a semi-structured interview. Of the participants, 17 were in dyadic relationships (53% spouses, 41% parent/child and 6% sibling relationships). They also completed the Brain Injury Grief Inventory (BIGI; Coetzer, B. R., Vaughan, F. L., & Ruddle, J. A. (2003). The Brain Injury Grief Inventory. Unpublished Manuscript. North Wales Brain Injury Service, Conwy & Denbighshire NHS Trust) as a quantitative measure of loss after ABI. Five main themes emerged from the interviews: loss of person; loss of relationships; loss of activity/ability; loss of future; unclear loss. There were distinct differences qualitatively between individuals and relatives and only two dyads experienced similar loss, but there were no significant differences in loss as measured quantitatively by the BIGI. The differences between relatives' loss and individuals with ABIs' loss are discussed. This research suggests that it is important when supporting families to consider individual experiences, because even though the loss originates from the same injury, the loss as experienced may substantially differ among those affected by it.

Recently, the AMA has proposed emphasizing safe use and disposal of opioids, but patient perceptions on this proposed solution are largely unknown. In this study, we evaluate the willingness of adolescents to commit to pill security and safe opioid use in a clinical setting. Design and methods: In this prospective survey study conducted in an urban emergency department, a consecutive sample of adolescent patients between 15 and 22 years were asked about their exposure to opioids and attitudes toward the potential harm of opioid use/misuse and whether they were willing to consider to committing to pill security and safe opioid use in a clinical setting. We then assessed if willingness to commit varied based on attitude toward opioid misuse or previous experience with prescription opioids. Results: Eighty-one percent (91/113) of eligible patients agreed to participate. Overall 29.7% of adolescents had received a prescription for opioids and 40.7% had leftover pills. 87.9% were willing to commit to take opioids only as prescribed and 83.5% were willing to commit to disposing leftover opioids. Willingness did not vary by previous exposure to prescription opioids or attitudes toward recreational opioid use. Discussion and conclusions: Adolescents are highly willing to commit to safe opioid use and disposal regardless of previous exposure to opioids or attitude toward opioid misuse.

However, recent research suggests that few of the recommended PBSs may be effective in reducing longer-term alcohol consumption, with some appearing to result in increased intake over time. Objectives: To identify factors associated with enactment of specific PBSs to inform alcohol control efforts that aim to encourage the use of effective strategies and attenuate the effects of strategies found to be associated with increased consumption. Methods: Australian adult drinkers (n = 2,003; 50% male) completed an online survey assessing their alcohol consumption, frequency of attending drinking venues, enactment of specific PBSs, and demographic characteristics. Results: Greater enactment of the PBS that has previously been found to be associated with reduced alcohol use ('Count your drinks') was found among older respondents and those with lower levels of alcohol consumption. Older respondents were also more likely to enact two of the three PBSs that have been found to be associated with increased alcohol consumption ('Use a designated driver' and 'Leave drinking venues at a pre-determined time'). Conclusions/Importance: Results suggest that enactment of specific PBSs may differ according to the individual-level variables of gender, age, and preferred beverage type, and the environmental-level variable of attendance at licensed premises. Randomized trials investigating the effectiveness of PBS interventions among drinker subgroups are needed to determine the extent to which enactment reduces alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm and whether effects are moderated by the variables assessed in this study.

Family carers of individuals with FTD find apathy and disinhibition particularly challenging leading to high levels of stress and burden. Positive behaviour support (PBS) as a behaviour intervention framework has never been trialled in FTD. This pilot study examined the functional basis of apathetic and disinhibited behaviours in four FTD dyads and explored the acceptability of a PBS intervention. The PBS programme was provided by an occupational therapist in the participants' homes. Measures collected at baseline and post-intervention (M = 3.9 months) assessed: function of behaviours, challenging behaviours, and qualitative outcomes pertaining to the acceptability of the PBS approach. PBS was an acceptable intervention for all four dyads. "Sensory" and "tangible" were the most common functions contributing to the maintenance of behaviour changes, and aspects of apathetic and disinhibited behaviours improved following intervention. This study demonstrates the acceptability and potential benefit of a PBS programme to provide support in FTD. A more rigorous trial will be an important next step in developing improved services tailored to the needs of this unique population.		[O'Connor, Claire M.

Net Effect of Young Adult Dual Combusted Cigarette and E-Cigarette Users' Anticipated Responses to Hypothetical E-Cigarette Marketing Restrictions								SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE				55	6			1028	1030		10.1080/10826084.2019.1710209			APR 1 2020	2020	Background: Dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes is common among young adults. Earlier research has used an internet panel to assess anticipated effects of eliminating nicotine, flavors (except menthol), and customizable e-cigarettes on predicted changes in e-cigarette and cigarette consumption. This earlier analysis showed that all these policies were predicted to lower e-cigarette consumption and increase cigarette consumption among these dual users. The earlier analysis, did not, however, estimate the net effect of these policies considering both lowered and increased consumption. Methods: We computed the net effects of these policies as the difference between people predicting quitting or using cigarettes less and those predicting that they would use them more. The same calculations were done for e-cigarettes. Significance testing was done with z-tests. Results: As expected, the net effect of all three policies was to significantly lower e-cigarette consumption. The net effect was to also lower cigarette consumption for eliminating nicotine and flavors in e-cigarettes, with no significant net effect of eliminating modifiable e-cigarettes. Conclusion: Eliminating nicotine and flavors from e-cigarettes is predicted to lower cigarette as well as e-cigarette consumption.

We explored the most common barriers to general healthcare faced by clients utilizing syringe access services. Methods: Clients of Project Safe Point- a syringe access service serving Albany, NY and surrounding regions-were surveyed on their general health practices and specific health care barriers. Descriptive analyses were used to identify which barriers were most prevalent. Results: Of the clients surveyed (n = 59), the most common specific barriers were deprioritization of medical care (i.e., procrastination [80%], finding it easier to ignore the problem [63%]), cost (i.e., not having insurance [59%], not being able to afford the cost of care [58%]), transportation (53%), and judgement by clinicians (53%). When participants were asked to choose which was their biggest barrier to healthcare, judgement by clinicians was chosen more than twice as often as any other barrier. Conclusion: While people who inject drugs at a syringe access program often experience traditional barriers to healthcare (i.e., logistical barriers, procrastination), nearly a quarter of the clients reported feeling judged by clinicians as their most significant barrier. Future work in this field should explore interventions that motivate clients to seek care and that reduce stigma in healthcare interactions.

However, little is known about how patients and their care partners utilise smartphones in their day-to-day lives. We collected self-reported smartphone utilisation data from patients referred for neuropsychological evaluations (N = 53), their care partners (N = 44), and an Amazon Mechanical Turk control sample (N = 204). Patient participants were less likely to own a smartphone than controls, with increasing age associated with less utilisation of smartphone features in all groups. Of the patients who owned smartphones, spontaneous use of cognitive aid features (e.g., reminders and calendars) occurred on only a monthly-to-weekly basis; by comparison, patients reported utilising social/general features (e.g., email and internet) on a weekly-to-daily basis. Individuals referred for geriatric cognitive disorder evaluations were less likely to own and use smartphones than individuals referred for other reasons. Care partners reported using their smartphones more frequently than control group adults, with 55% of care partners endorsing utilising their device in caring for the patient. Building upon existing smartphone use habits to increase the use of cognitive aid features may be a feasible intervention for some patients, and including care partners in such interventions is encouraged.

The present study compared outcomes following TBI in individuals from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) backgrounds with those from non-CALD backgrounds. 103 CALD and 103 non-CALD participants with predominantly moderate to severe TBI completed a series of questionnaires an average of 22 months post-injury. Groups were comparable in most demographic and injury-related variables, but CALD participants had lower pre-injury employment rates. Individuals in the CALD group were significantly less independent in light domestic duties, shopping, and financial management and reported significantly lower cognitive independence, mobility, and participation in occupational and social activities than non-CALD participants post-injury. They also reported heightened awareness of post-injury deficits, different beliefs regarding injury consequences and factors aiding recovery, more anxiety and depression symptoms, and less problem-focused coping. Higher functional outcome was associated with having a value system that is Australian, younger age at injury, and higher education. Overall, independent of rehabilitation access, individuals from a CALD background showed poorer functional outcome following TBI than those from a non-CALD background. Addressing this discrepancy should be a priority for rehabilitation programmes.

We conceived a screening test for confabulation, the Confabulation Screen (CS), a brief test using 10 questions of episodic memory (EM), where confabulators most frequently confabulate. It was postulated that the CS would predict confabulations not only in EM, but also in the other subordinate structures of personal temporality, namely the present and the future. Thirty confabulating amnesic patients of various aetiologies and 97 normal controls entered the study. Participants were administered the CS and the Confabulation Battery (Dalla Barba, G., & Decaix, C. (2009). "Do you remeber what you did on March 13 1985?" A case study of confabulatory hypermnesia. Cortex, 45(5), 566-574). Confabulations in the CS positively and significantly correlated with confabulations in personal temporality domains of the CB, namely EM, orientation in time and place and episodic plans. Conversely, as expected, they did not correlate with confabulations in impersonal temporality domains of the CB. Consistent with results of previous studies, the most frequently observed type of confabulation in the CS was Habits Confabulation. The CS had high construct validity and good discriminative validity in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Cut-off scores for clinical and research purposes are proposed. The CS provides efficient and valid screening for confabulatory impairment.

Loneliness and cortisol are associated with social network regulation								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				15	3			269	281		10.1080/17470919.2019.1709540			MAY 3 2020	2020	This study examines how loneliness and the body's stress response system interact to regulate social connections. We suggest that the drive to reconnect signaled by loneliness can be accompanied physiologically by the production of cortisol, which can offer supportive coping resources. Thus, we investigated how loneliness, cortisol levels, and their interaction predicted changes in network connections in a social organization. Participants (n = 193; 53% female) provided friendship network data at two times. At time 1, participants reported on loneliness and donated saliva (later assayed for cortisol). Results revealed that concurrently, lonely individuals reported fewer friendships, whereas over time, they named more friends. These results support the hypothesis that loneliness is a signal to develop connections. We also explored whom lonely individuals befriended over time. Results showed that cortisol significantly moderated the preference for friends with a similar level of loneliness. Specifically, lonely individuals with higher cortisol befriended those who were less lonely over those who were lonelier. Thus, cortisol levels may serve an adaptive function in mobilizing resources to develop connections that fulfill social belongingness needs. Results supported the theorized signaling function of loneliness and revealed that loneliness and the stress response system interact to shape social connections.

We expected that strategy training (ReSET) would be more effective than cognitive training (Cogniplus) in improving patients' everyday life executive functioning. Neuropsychological assessment was administered at baseline, at 2 weeks and 3-5 months post-treatment. Primary outcome measure was the Role Resumption List (RRL). Secondary outcome measures were treatment goal attainment (TGA), Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and neuropsychological tests. No effects of treatment were found on the primary outcome measure and on neuropsychological tests, except for one test of attention. At 2 weeks and 3-5 months post-treatment, PD patients in both the ReSET and Cogniplus group reported a significant improvement in everyday life executive functioning, as measured with TGA and the DEX-self, with an advantage for ReSET only shortly after treatment. Given these results and that PD patients were able to adhere to these treatments despite their motor symptoms and fatigue (i.e., the drop-out rate was small), we conclude that both strategy training and cognitive training for impairments in EF might be beneficial and feasible for PD patients.

It is defined as impaired contralesional stimulus detection, response, or action, causing functional disability. While prism adaptation treatment is highly promising to promote functional recovery of spatial neglect, not all individuals respond. Consistent with a primary effect of prism adaptation on spatial movements, we previously demonstrated that functional improvement after prism adaptation treatment is linked to frontal lobe lesions. However, that study was a treatment-only study with no randomised control group. The current study randomised individuals with spatial neglect to receive 10 days of prism adaptation treatment or to receive only standard care (control group). Replicating our earlier results, we found that the presence of frontal lesions moderated response to prism adaptation treatment: among prism-treated patients, only those with frontal lesions demonstrated functional improvements in their neglect symptoms. Conversely, among individuals in the standard care control group, the presence of frontal lesions did not modify recovery. These results suggest that further research is needed on how frontal lesions may predict response to prism adaptation treatment. Additionally, the results help elucidate the neural network involved in spatial movement and could be used to aid decisions about treatment.

While progressive resistance training (PRT) has been shown to reduce fatigue in persons with MS, it is not clear why these reductions occur. One hypothesis is that PRT may induce functional changes to the caudate, a region highly implicated in MS fatigue. The aim of the current study was to study the effects of PRT on overall fatigue impact and resting-state functional connectivity of the caudate in persons with MS reporting severe fatigue. Participants were semi-randomly assigned to either a 16-week home-based PRT (n = 5) or stretching control (n = 5) condition. Both groups demonstrated reductions in overall fatigue impact (main effect of time: F = .84, d = .65). Significant group x time interactions were found, with the PRT group demonstrating post-training increases in functional connectivity between the caudate and left inferior parietal (F = 66.0, p < .001), bilateral frontal (both p < .001), and right insula (F = 21.8, p = .002) regions compared to the stretching group. Furthermore, greater post-training increases in functional connectivity between the caudate and left inferior parietal region were associated with greater decreases in cognitive fatigue (r = -.52) specifically. This study provides initial evidence for the caudate as a potential neural substrate for the beneficial effects of PRT on fatigue in persons with MS.

Although the practice of CT using debate is widely used to improve open-minded thought, the cognitive processes underlying this improvement remain poorly understood. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to assess how neural responses while considering another's opinion are changed by CT practice and to determine whether the cortical network showing activation changes related to personality traits is relevant to consensus building. A total of 52 healthy participants were divided into three groups for an intervention; the participants read another's reasoning regarding a controversial issue and judged whether this person's viewpoint was affirmative during fMRI measurements. The intervention required them to prepare speech texts from a designated viewpoint based on both themselves and others. Compared to the control group, the group who took another's perspective showed enhanced activation of the right parieto-frontal network, that has been implicated in belief update, cognitive reappraisal of emotion, and self-perspective inhibition. Additionally, activation of the orbitofrontal cortex was negatively correlated with a stubbornness index. The results provide the first neural evidence of the effects of CT practice and support the notion that open-minded thought underlies the benefits of this practice.

These problems affect independence and may limit the ability to benefit from rehabilitation. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of NeuroPage for people with MS living in the community. A multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled crossover trial was conducted. The intervention comprised the NeuroPage service, which sends reminder messages to mobile phones at pre-arranged times. In the control condition participants received "non-memory texts", that is, messages not aimed at providing a reminder; for example, supplying news headlines or sport updates. Outcome measures were completed using postal questionnaires after each condition. There were 38 participants aged 28 to 72 (mean 48, SD 11) and 10 (26%) were men. There were no significant differences between NeuroPage and control conditions on the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (p = 0.41, d = 0.02).

Results showed that approaching social and non-social stimuli of varying threat levels elicited activation of frontoparietal regions previously linked to peripersonal space, as well as of the midbrain periaqueductal gray, suggesting the engagement of defensive mechanisms by personal space intrusions. However, functional connectivity patterns of the midbrain differed for social and non-social stimuli, with enhanced coupling with the premotor cortex to approaching social stimuli. Additionally, connectivity strength between the midbrain and the premotor cortex was associated with preferred interpersonal distance. These findings highlight a common defensive architecture implicated in personal space regulation to social and non-social stimuli, and the specific neural mechanisms involved in regulating the distance from conspecifics.

J	Bright, Peter; van der Linde, Ian								Comparison of methods for estimating premorbid intelligence								NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION				30	1			1	14		10.1080/09602011.2018.1445650			JAN 2 2020	2020	To evaluate impact of neurological injury on cognitive performance it is typically necessary to derive a baseline (or "premorbid") estimate of a patient's general cognitive ability prior to the onset of impairment. In this paper, we consider a range of common methods for producing this estimate, including those based on current best performance, embedded "hold/no-hold" tests, demographic information, and word reading ability. Ninety-two neurologically healthy adult participants were assessed on the full Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, D. (2008). Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (4th ed.). San Antonio, TX: Pearson Assessment.) and on two widely used word reading tests: National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, H. E. (1982). National Adult Reading Test (NART): For the assessment of premorbid intelligence in patients with dementia: Test manual. Windsor: NFER-Nelson.; Nelson, H. E., & Willison, J. (1991). National Adult Reading Test (NART). Windsor: NFER-Nelson.) and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Wechsler, D. (2001). Wechsler Test of Adult Reading: WTAR. San Antonio, TX: Psychological Corporation.). Our findings indicate that reading tests provide the most reliable and precise estimates of WAIS-IV full-scale IQ, although the addition of demographic data provides modest improvement. Nevertheless, we observed considerable variability in correlations between NART/WTAR scores and individual WAIS-IV indices, which indicated particular usefulness in estimating more crystallised premorbid abilities (as represented by the verbal comprehension and general ability indices) relative to fluid abilities (working memory and perceptual reasoning indices). We discuss and encourage the development of new methods for improving premorbid estimates of cognitive abilities in neurological patients.

Yet, little is known about other substance use among those who misuse tranquilizers. Objectives: This study characterized subgroups of individuals with tranquilizer misuse, based on patterns of polysubstance use. Methods: Data were extracted from the 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health; adults with past-month tranquilizer misuse were included (N = 1253). We utilized latent class analysis to identify patterns of polysubstance use in the previous month. Results: We identified three distinct latent classes, including the: (1) limited polysubstance use class (approximately 54.6% of the sample), (2) binge alcohol and cannabis use class (28.5% of the sample), and (3) opioid use class (16.9% of the sample). The binge alcohol and cannabis use class and the opioid use class were characterized by high probabilities of other substance misuse, including cocaine and prescription stimulants. Those in the binge alcohol and cannabis use class and the opioid use class reported more motives for tranquilizer misuse and higher rates of sexually transmitted infection, criminal involvement, and suicidal ideation. Those in the opioid use class also had greater psychological distress and higher rates of injection drug use. Conclusions: Nearly half of those with tranquilizer misuse in a general population sample were categorized into one of two high polysubstance use classes, and these two classes were associated with poorer functioning. Findings from these analyses underscore the need to reduce polysubstance use among those who misuse tranquilizers.

Objectives: The present study explored Dry November participants' personal experiences and coping strategies during a one-month abstinence period. The research is embedded in the Hungarian context of drinking habits, culture, society, and alcohol policy. Methods: This qualitative study comprised the thematic analysis of 23 participants' diaries, reported twice a week for 30 days (in November 2017), to identify and understand the common experiences of temporary sobriety. Results: Three main themes emerged from the analysis: challenge, community, and relationship toward alcohol and abstinence. Results showed that there are no categorical differences between successful and non-successful participants. Conclusions: The present research demonstrated that during the challenge, rather than simply saying 'no' to alcohol, participants utilized other refusal strategies to avoid social confrontation.

Material/Methods: Participants: 482 Japanese baseball players who belonged to a university baseball team (mean age = 19.43 years, SD = 1.00) were included in the analysis. A face sheet, a questionnaire on the yips, the scale of overcommitment to sport, and the Bidimensional Resilience Scale. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the extent, to which overcommitment and resilience predicted the presence or absence of developing the yips in baseball. Results: The results indicated the overcommitment was significant but the two factors of resilience, namely, innate resilience and acquired resilience were not significant. Thus, it is possible that the higher the tendency of overcommitment to baseball, the higher the possibility of developing the yips. It is recommended that a longitudinal study be conducted to examine what factors are involved in the process in depth. Conclusions: The purpose of the present study was to clarify the relationship between the development of the yips in baseball, overcommitment to sport, and resilience. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that while overcommitment was significant in the development of the yips, innate and acquired resilience were not.

This study aimed to analyze the conceptions of families according to the children's verbal report. A total of 108 children aged 5 to 12 years (M = 8.58, SD = 1.54), living in the city of Rio de Janeiro, participated in this study. The following question was asked to each of them: "What does family mean to you?". The answers were stored in text and audio format in order to perform lexical analysis, using the IRaMuTeQ software, and content analysis, according to Bardin's proposal. The results indicated that the focus of the children remains in families of traditional configurations. It was observed, however, that from early years, children recognize families from the point of view of affection and functions associated with care and protection.

This is a subject little explored by literature from the perspective of the clowns and their identity. In view of the above, the present research aimed to investigate the clown's identity, including his/her personal and social dimensions. An exploratory, qualitative approach was carried out. In the study, ten clowns participated, who answered a semi-structured interview script, processed by the IRAMUTEQ software. The results show that the experiences in the context of the formation and practice of the clown make it possible to develop several aspects of personal and social identity. It is concluded that the clown subverts the logic through joke and laughter, facilitating the resignification of the other individual and his/her own identity.

Although there is a large body of research in this area, there are few studies that show how these phonological skills develop in students with atypical intellectual or cognitive characteristics. The objective of this study is to characterize the level of phonological awareness skill in students with borderline intellectual functioning attending School Integration Programs. To assess the level of phonological awareness, the Phonological Awareness Test was used. The participants were 37 students in the first to third years of primary education with a diagnosis of borderline intellectual functioning. The results showed an important heterogeneous decrease in the development of the phonological skills assessed, which indicates a high degree of risk in the acquisition of reading, as well as in the projection and academic progress of these students. The implications for practice, policies, and future research in this area are discussed.

Thirty to thirty-six-months-old children were assigned to two conditions in which the presence or absence of the sequence was manipulated. Children observed images of different actions on a tablet; afterwards, they had to choose a real object that showed the result of each action. Results showed that the presence of the sequence constituted a factor that enhances the early understanding of images as representations of real actions.

To attribute causality to its associated disease profile, social determinants need to be identified at the population level. The objective of this study was to explore perceptions regarding stress and its probable social determinants, among a purposeful cohort of the public from Colombo district, Sri Lanka. Methods: A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted among adults. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 8-10 participants into homogenous groups. Data were collected until information saturation. A semistructured FGD guide was used to facilitate the discussions. Content analysis methods were used to analyze data. Results: Six FGDs consisting of 59 participants were conducted. Participants included primary healthcare workers, community members, village leaders, private and public sector employees, unemployed individuals, homemakers, self-employed persons, slum dwellers, and persons from affluent communities. Three main themes emerged: social, economic, and cultural factors. Social factors consisted of four sub-themes: social role or status, generation gap, disability, and unsafe environment. Economic factors included three related subthemes: poverty, unemployment, and job insecurity. Cultural factors included three subthemes: superstitious beliefs, religion and caste, marriage and dowry. Conclusion: Elements regarding stress and its social determinants among the public in Sri Lanka seem to be an amalgam of interconnected sociocultural and economic factors. However, addressing these social determinants in isolation (at an individual level) may not be feasible, as most causes appear to be outside the scope of the individual.

There are no reports on the quality of life of patients with rare Mega-Giant Carotid Artery Aneurysms (MGCAA) manifesting themselves as chronically large and growing neck tumors. The aim of the research was an evaluation of the health related quality of life (HRQL) of a patient following aneurysmotomy of Mega-Giant Carotid Artery Aneurysms (MGCAA). Case study: An 82-year-old patient was referred to the Department of Vascular Surgery at the John Paul II Hospital in Krakow, due to the presence of a mega-giant, painful tumor covering the entire left side of the neck. A physical examination and angio-CT confirmed the presence of a pulsating tumor, which extended vertically from the level of the angle of the mandible to the clavicle, and horizontally from the trachea to the cervical spine. An aneurysmotomy and reconstruction of LICA with cerebral protection using a shunt catheter was performed. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and extubated shortly after the procedure, without any Central Nervous System neurological defects. The surgery was complicated by left recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis and aphonia without dyspnoea, which was only partially resolved around 3 months after the operation itself. The postoperative period was uncomplicated. Health related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was studied using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) to study both the clinical symptoms and how these symptoms would be reduced in a year follow up after the aneurysmotomy. Conclusions: Despite the increasing availability of endovascular options and techniques, open surgical repair of ICA aneurysms, especially Mega-Giant Carotid Artery Aneurysms (MGCAA), using cerebral protection (shunts), remains a basic option, providing an opportunity to avoid major intraoperative and postoperative complications. The aneurysmotomy, despite laryngeal nerve paresis and aphonia without dyspnoea, improves the patient's health-related quality of life.

This study investigated the sexual subjectivity of young Brazilian adults, evaluated the correlation between sexual subjectivity and quality of life, and also the impact of religiosity on sexual subjectivity. Participants were 1380 from ages 18 to 30 who completed a free online survey, including the Inventario de Self-Sexual (ISS). The design was quantitative, descriptive, and transversal. All of the Bs's subscales had a positive correlation with the satisfaction with life and self-esteem scales. Some sexual subjectivity subscales showed a negative correlation with religiosity, while sexual body-esteem presented a positive one. The women in the sample scored significantly higher on the entitlement to sexual pleasure from self and partner subscales. Bisexual women stood out with higher scores than the heterosexual men and women, despite having lower self-esteem. Future research with more variables and a broader sample will help further the understanding of this barely explored construct.

Researchers developed an instrumental cross-sectional study on a non-probabilistic sample of workers (n(Argentina) = 663, n(Brazil) = 672). The results indicate that the scale is invariant at configural (SB chi(2)/(gl) = 2.06, GFI = .96, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .03), metric (Delta GFI = .009, Delta CFI = .008, Delta RMSEA = .006), and scalar levels (Delta GFI = .007, Delta CFI = .009, Delta RMSEA = .004); whereas, partially invariant at a strict level. In turn, the comparison of latent and observed means shows that Brazilian participants are more satisfied with their jobs (M-Brazil = 3.86, SDBrazil = .91, M-Argentina = 3.52, SDArgentina = . 90 , t = 8.54, p < .000; CR = 11.062, p <.000), although it is in small effects (d= .37; r= .18). The results obtained indicate that the scale is adjusted to the model of strict factorial invariance, except for three of its items that only reached strong invariance.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of life of a group of people with Parkinson's disease. The clinical and progressive characteristics of the disease, its motor and neuropsychological impact were evaluated in each Parkinsonian subject included in the study. Material/Methods: A quality of life assessment was performed and collected from 60 Parkinsonian patients followed and hospitalized at Hassan II University Hospital in Fez. Different instruments were used, the Hoenh and Yahr scale and the Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39) UPDRS engine, MMS, clinical fact sheet. Results: According to our results, through the different tests and scale of evaluation, we observed an impaired quality of life in the areas of physical discomfort, cognitive disorder, activity of daily living, mobility, and emotional well-being, especially in patients with duration of evolution more than 5 years. There was no significant difference between the two sexes. Conclusions: In addition, the severity of the disease tended to give the impression of an impaired quality of life with respect to the dimensions of activities of daily living and cognition, which is relevant to improving the quality of life patient life and clinical interventions.

Children populations have not been studied thoroughly, with regard to the effect of sleep deprivation on communication abilities. In this study, we investigate the pragmatic competence following acute sleep deprivation. Case studies: Two eleven-year-old boys were evaluated on their pragmatic ability before and following sleep deprivation. The conversations were video-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using the CHAT conventions. The Pragmatic Evaluation Protocol Revised (PREP-R) was administered for the investigation of pragmatic ability. Results: Both children demonstrated a significantly lower performance following acute sleep deprivation. Their specific pragmatic ability and grammatically-based pragmatic ability were impaired. The subjects were unable to use lexical, morphological and syntactic cohesion, and encountered difficulties in the interaction and the managing of pauses. Conclusions: Acute sleep deprivation affects pragmatic competence, mainly due to difficulties in alertness, attention, working memory, and executive dysfunction in general. Variability in the pragmatic ability of the two subjects implies that more studies, focused on the cognitive deficits after sleep deprivation can cast more light on the evaluation of pragmatic ability.

This study aimed to identify and compare the social representations of aging built by senior participants of cohabiting groups for the elderly (G1) and non-participant elderly (G2). Method. The participation of 60 elders was equally distributed by gender. A socio-demographic questionnaire, the Free Word Association Technique (FAWT), and a semi-structured interview were all applied. The data collected by the FAWT were analyzed by the technique of semantic networks, while the interviews were investigated by IRaMuTeQ software. Results. Overall, it was found that the elderly in cohabitation groups characterized aging with positive aspects, associating it with health and physical activities while those who did not participate associated it with negative aspects related to disease, loss and decline.

To determine the inter-gender differences in dispositional optimism, depression, anxiety, and stress; as well as the predictive role of optimism on pathological features in a sample of Ecuadorian university students. Method. This is a descriptive, comparative, predictive and cross-sectional study using the Life Orientation (LOT-R) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) tests with 288 university students belonging to one university of Ambato; 63.9% women, 31% men aged between 17 to 39 (M = 21.6 years, SD = 2.5). Results. Gender differences were found at the Anxiety and Stress level, with greater presence in women than in men. As regards dispositional optimism and depression, gender is invariant. There were both slight and significant correlations between dispositional optimism and the dimensions evaluated by the DASS 21 test. Dispositional optimism also explains changes in variance in depression (15.2%), anxiety (9.7%) and stress (5.5%). As a conclusion, dispositional optimism is a relevant predictor of depression, as well as anxiety and stress in university students.

J	Markiewicz, Katarzyna; Gas, Zbigniew B.								NATURE OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WORK AND FAMILY SATISFACTION IN WOMEN								ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA				18	1			29	44		10.5604/01.3001.0013.9737			2020	2020	Background: The aim of the present study was to specify the nature of the relationships between work and marital satisfaction in the women. In addition it aimed at revealing as to whether demographic variables, such as age, position, length of service, marriage duration, and the number of children have an impact upon the work and marital satisfaction in working women. Material/Methods: The present study included 120 married, working women, and analyses the relationship between job satisfaction and marital satisfaction, taking into consideration emotional and cognitive factors. The participants were mostly office workers, of whom 20 (8%) occupied management positions. The Descriptions Inventory, Job Affect Scale, Questionnaire of Well-matched Marriage, and a scale of work-job interactions were administered. Results: Significant positive correlations across almost all variables of job and marital satisfaction were observed. This means that the increase of marital satisfaction corresponds with the increase in job satisfaction, although the work/family conflict resulted in experiencing negative emotions at work. Moreover, the level of job satisfaction was higher than the level of family satisfaction. It was also found that the age and time spent at work proved to have a negative impact upon job satisfaction. Conclusions: Work-family facilitation proved to be crucial since its exclusion made the interface between all factors of family satisfaction and work insignificant. At the same time, the managerial women suffered from work/family conflict to a greater degree than did office workers. The study revealed also that the needs of older workers should be taken into account to maintain their work/life balance.

However, it changes over life and tends to decrease in size in old age. The aim of this work was to explore its composition and size in the different life stages: youth (20 to 30 years old), middle-age (40 to 50 years old), old age (60 to 70 years old), and advanced old age (80 to 90 years old). To do this, we introduced a crosscutting, non-experimental design. To an intentional non-probabilistic sample of 400 research subjects, residing in Mar del Plata (100 out of each age group), we applied a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Structured Interview of Sources of Social Support (Vaux & Harrison, 1985). The data were analyzed through R version 3.4.1. Distributions of percentages to compare the composition as well as the t-test, the ANOVA, and Bonferroni's contrast were used to identify differences between groups. The results show that friendship, partners, and siblings are the most included bonds at all life stages. At less age, the size of the social support network is bigger than at other ages. The higher average of friends, co-workers/study, and community/health services relation belongs to young people, middle-aged, and old-aged adults, respectively. It is concluded that the network shows changes throughout life, which can affect well-being.

But they did not yield consistent findings in the delta, theta, alpha, or beta bands. Methods: A total of 30 drug-naive or drug-free subjects with a depressive episode or recurrent depressive disorder were compared with 30 age, sex, education, and handedness-matched healthy controls using qEEG power spectra in six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, slow beta, and fast beta) and total activities separately. Spectral analysis was performed on a section of 180 s of qEEG digitized at the rate of 512 samples/s/channel, and absolute powers were log-transformed before statistical analysis. Results: Statistically significant differences between the patients and normal controls were found in the delta and the total bands, while Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-D) score predicted the fast beta spectral power at the left temporal region. In the entire region of the brain, in the theta band, lesser absolute spectral power was found in patients than normal controls, whereas in the fast beta band, it was greater. In other bands, greater powers of spectral activities were found in patients than normal controls consistently in the parietal and occipital regions. Conclusion: Various findings of qEEG absolute power spectra could demonstrate a difference between the patients with depressive disorder and the normal controls independently and efficiently. However, all the differences collectively showed stronger evidence. The findings may steer future studies to differentiate the patients with depressive disorder from controls.

A structured interview was used, and then analyzed from the Iramuteq program, in addition to sociodemographic data. In the results, the Descending Hierarchical Classification divided the textual corpus into four classes of representational proximity. On the one hand, social representations directed towards LGBT seniors as a phase of loneliness and suffering, which is a phenomenon not yet known by society. On the other, discussions based on respect, attention and care, in addition to senior LGBT as an achievement attributed to happiness. It is argued that sample diversity results in different social representations. The data revealed that society is moving towards understanding gender differentiation and sexual orientation in which old age is a phase in which all can experience.

When we see a wall, we do not only perceive its brute physical properties (such as color, size, location, etc.), but we perceive it as climbable, depending on the context in which such perception occurs. The notion of climbability embedded into the perception of the wall will be called affordance. Over the last years, this concept has become popular within a number of disciplines; however, this has not been accompanied by a precise and unified conceptual development of the term. This article formulates and examines some of the most fundamental debates surrounding the understanding of the current concept of affordance. After critically evaluating some of the main tenets within these discussions, I propose a number of challenges that the development of the produces and explore some ways in which such challenges can be faced.

Imagery ability enhances imagery use. The perception of injury but also individual differences themselves influence the rehabilitation outcome. The first purpose of the study was to examine the mediation effect of injury perception between general imagery and rehabilitation imagery. Our second aim was to examine the mediating effects of the general tendency to employ imagery within the relationship between personality and the imagery of rehabilitation itself. Material/Methods:The studyinvolved 56 athletes (37 men and 19 women) suffered a physical injury. The respondents were asked to provide demographic information and then to complete following questionnaires:The Athletic Injury ImageryQuestionnaire-AIIQ-2, (Sordoni et al., 2002), The Imagination in Sport Questionnaire (Budnik-Przybylska, 2014) - short version, and Blecharz's Scale of Perception of Injury in Sport (SPUwS) (Blecharz, 2008). Series of mediation analyses were performed to estimate the strength of the indirect relationship between the general tendency to use imagery and the use of imagery in rehabilitation. Results: It was fund that the general tendency to use imagery turned out to have a strong direct effect on rehabilitation imagery. Reflection and seeking positive sides turned out to be a mediator between general tendency to use imagery and all rehabilitation imagery dimensions. Reflection has the strongest effect between the general tendency to use imagery and cognitive specific imagery. General tendency to use imagery mediates the relationship between personality and imagery of rehabilitation. Some personality traits also influence directly imagery of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Our findings have revealed that the general tendency to use imagery may strengthen the relationship between personality and rehabilitation imagery. It may help to adjust the methods which might positively influence the rehabilitation process.

The aim is to identify the differences between anxiety and depression according to contextual variables in women with breast cancer who are under treatment. Method. A comparative study was carried out in 91 women with breast cancer in three care units in Northeast Mexico. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used. Results. The 51.6% (f = 47) resulted in anxiety and 25.3% (f = 23) depression. Anxiety and depression are not different according to the degree of schooling (p > .05) and marital status (p > .05). Depression (p = .001) and anxiety (p = 05) is different according to the unit of attention. In conclusion, it is important to take care of the emotional state of cancer patients since it was observed that half of the patients presented anxiety and a quarter with depression. It is necessary to analyze the context because depression and anxiety are different regarding the unit of attention.

Researcher investigated if differences between gender groups were influenced by other variables such as period of ageing ("young-old" vr "old-old") and place of residence (big city, small town, village). Material/Methods: The study sample comprised 2565 elderly who were at least 60 years of age. The average age for men was 72,76 and for women 72,39. The health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Polish adaptation WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Results: Respondents rated both quality of life and general health well. Nevertheless the health-related quality of life domains' rating decreases with age. Women are commonly less satisfied with the WHOQOL-BREF domains. Men living in little towns declared not only a high level of quality of life, but their estimates in the early and late old age are similar. Conclusions: The diversity of health-related quality of life needs further investigation along with a number of more subjective indicators of individual experiencing one's old age (e.g. sense of one's time of life or the awareness of age-related changes).

Negative emotions and cognitions have direct effects on aggression: however, few studies have considered the relevance of positive cognitions, such as self-confidence and optimism. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether optimism bias, positive self-perception, and self-confidence predict aggression in men. We also tested whether testosterone and cortisol mediate the relationship between positive cognitions and aggression. Our results indicate that optimism bias and self-confidence are significant predictors of aggression. Although steroid hormones predicted the occurrence of positive cognitions, no hormonal measures mediated the relationship between aggression and optimism or self-confidence. Therefore, positive cognitions, mainly optimism bias, can play a role in male aggression, possibly by reducing impulse control, which increases risk-taking behaviors.

The goal of our research was to study cognitive impairment in a patient at an early stage of VaD. We evaluated latencies of the P3 GO and NOGO components of event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited in cued GO/NOGO tasks, as potential neuromarkers of cognitive impairment, as suggested by previous research. Case study: The patient, a right-handed, 53-year-old male with a college education, suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 2011. During this attack, which lasted for a few minutes, he was confused and had trouble speaking, trouble seeing in both eyes, difficulty walking, problems with balance and coordination, and strange behavior. Seven years later, in 2018, he was assessed using the HBI methodology, which consisted of recording (1) a 19-channel EEG in resting state (with eyes open and eyes closed), and (2) a cued GO/NOGO task, and then comparing the results with EEG spectra and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) data from normative and patient databases. The patient died in 2019. Post-mortem studies confirmed cortical microhaemorrhages neuropathological criteria for VaD. We did not found deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (HPT) and A beta, which fulfil the neuropathological criteria for AD. Results: The parietal-temporal-occipital EEG power was significantly higher in all conditions in this subject in comparison to healthy controls, indicating idling of the corresponding areas. The amplitude and latency of the P3 GO wave were found to be intact in the subject, indicating normal posterior cortical functioning in the cognitive task. The latency of the P3 GO wave was found to be significantly higher in the subject, indicating impairment of engagement operations. Conclusions: In a GO/NOGO task, ERPs provide a useful tool for assessment of brain functioning in clinical settings.

We compare the mean valences between males and females and between participants from the final semester and participants from the first semester. The comparison of the mean valences values between the current study and the norm mean valence values from IAPS was established. Material/Methods: We tested 100 students from Higher Institute of Nursing Professions and Technics of Health, Rabat, Morocco. The panel valence from SAM was used to evaluate the perceived pleasure and unpleased degree after exposing the different images from IAPS to the participants. Results: The displeasure degree among nurse students from final semester is lower than that of the first semester with a significant difference in sixteen images. Regarding the difference between males and females, the significant difference was observed only in five images. The all images evaluated by participant were perceived as negative (valence <4). Regarding the comparison of the mean valences values between a the current study and the norm mean valence values from IAPS significant differences were observed. Conclusions: Nurse students from the final semester, compared to the first semester students, perceived the negative images assessed as less unpleasant. However, we noted that the all images have kept the negative aspect. These results show that these images can be used as a negative emotional stimulus among this population.

Older people are at risk of social exclusion, being unnecessary for others or even being a burden on one's surroundings. Hence, support and inclusion programs for various tasks and activities become extremely important. The aim of the presented research was to present proposals and evaluate the effects of a program dedicated to seniors, which was to improve their quality of life, psychophysical and social health. Material/Methods: The program involved 50 seniors from 2 different support centers, including 43 women and 7 men, average age 77.51 +/- 9.51. The assessment used the SUPIN questionnaire (Positive and Negative Feelings Scale), MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) and the VAS pain scale. Results and Conclusions: The obtained results confirmed the beneficial effect of the proposed activation program on the psychophysical health of the respondents. All subjects increased their level of positive emotions, while the level of negative ones decreased (p<0.05), hand functionality and general well-being improved, back and pain significantly decreased.

The current study are aimed to examine the impact of executive functions on functional recovery gain in a sample of right hemispheric (RH) frontal stroke patients. Material/Methods: total of 50 inpatients admitted to the Theseus Rehabilitation Center and diagnosed with RH frontal stroke were included in this study. The initial assessment of executive functioning was conducted using the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Functional recovery of basic activities of daily living (ADLs) was computed by the difference between follow-up and baseline Barthel Index (BI) scores. Results: Pearson's analysis revealed that the FAB global scores significantly correlated with the BI gain scores. Additionally, multiple regression analysis showed a significant contribution of only motor programming to the basic ADLs recovery gain. Conclusions: The global status of executive function was found to be significantly associated with functional recovery gain, and motor programming was the strongest predictor in RH frontal stroke patients. These findings are discussed for the treatment rehabilitation prognosis.

The presence of an association between peer attachment and the development of self-esteem could have a significant effect as a protecting factor against bullying during adolescence. The present study tested the predictor effect of peer attachment on different bullying conduct, as well the mediational role of self-esteem on the same association. The sample consisted of 351 individuals of both genders, with ages between 12 and 17 years old. The use of a model structural equation allowed obtaining results that point to the existence of a peer attachment predictive effect on victimization and aggressive behavior. Results also showed a total negative mediational effect of self-esteem on the association between peer attachment and victimization, namely the physical aggression. There is also a partial negative mediational effect on the association between peer attachment and victimization behavior towards social exclusion and verbal aggression.

Sexual Dysfunction in Women with Depression: A Hospital-Based Cross-sectional Comparative Study								INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE				42	1			46	51		10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_321_19			JAN-FEB 2020	2020	Background: There is a need to explore the sexual functioning of women with depression as one part of sexuality is that it helps in developing an intimate emotional and physical relationship with another person, and this relationship may serve as a buffer against life stresses. Our aim was to study the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunction in depressed women patients and to compare them with non-depressed women. Materials and Methods: A total of 270 participants who attended a teaching hospital were selected for the study - 135 cases and 135 controls. Sociodemographic and clinical details were collected. Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (M.I.N.I), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) scale, and Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) scale were used. Sexual dysfunction was assessed in both groups. Results: Among the cases, 47.40% had mild depression, 44.44% had moderate depression, and 8.15% were severely depressed. On the ASEX, 46.66% of the cases had sexual dysfunction, while it was only 8.89% among the controls. The difference in sexual dysfunction among cases and controls was statistically significant. Using the FSFI, 40% of the cases had female sexual dysfunction (FSD), and it was only 11.1% in controls. Conclusion: Sexual dysfunction was more common in females with clinical depression than in those without depression. Numerous factors can operate in the causation of FSD. This study underlines the importance of screening females with depression for FSD, for its early diagnosis and management.		[Reddy, R. Mrinalini; Saravanan, R.

This paper presents a study of dream intervention modes referred to in pass testimonies from Lacanian Schools affiliated with the World Association of Psychoanalysis and the School of Psychoanalysis of the Forums of the Lacanian Fields. Method. The intentional sample consists of 80 testimonies, obtained from the publications of each school. From that point, we analyzed qualitatively 14 examples, in which the intervention of the analyst over a dream story was explicit. Results. We could find varied interventions and gather them into four main ideas: (a) interrogation or invitation to associate; (b) interpretation; (c) cut; (d) other analytic act variations. As a conclusion, the Freudian approach with dreams is still in effect, but we also observe some others ways to intervene that aim beyond sense: to letter and to cut, as the foundations of psychoanalytic interpretation.

Studies from Southern India place different estimates of perinatal mental ill-health. Cultural variables affect health-seeking behaviour and are thus important to study in perinatal women with psychiatric morbidity. Methods: A total of 281 perinatal women were screened on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 6.0 (MINI), assisted with a clinical interview to identify psychiatric illnesses. The cultural formulation interview (CFI) of DSM-5 was applied on perinatal women having psychiatric illnesses and their caregivers. Results: A psychiatric diagnosis was present in 10.3% of perinatal women. Depression and anxiety disorders were seen in 7.12% and 1.41%, respectively. Marital discord (P < 0.0001), psychosocial stressors (P < 0.0001), and past history of psychiatric disorder (P < 0.001) were significantly higher in perinatal women with a current psychiatric diagnosis. On CFI work-related stress, the gender of the infant, low education and conflict across generations were identified as the negative aspects of the culture associated with psychiatric illness during and after pregnancy. Religion and social support were the major coping strategies, while stigma and financial problems were the major barriers to help-seeking. Conclusion: The high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the strikingly low help-seeking are noteworthy. These findings can help in planning treatment and prevention programs for timely detection and intervention for perinatal psychiatric disorders.

J	Milska, Katarzyna A.; Manski, Arkadiusz; Wierzba, Jolanta								PERCEPTION OF CHILDREN WITH CRANIOFACIAL MICROSOMIA ABNORMALITIES BY THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES								ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA				18	3			367	381					2020	2020	Background: When a child is born with a deformed face, his/her social environment is quickly confronted with a change which undoubtedly favours numerous over-generalizations. Children with craniofacial microsomia anomalies (CFCs) may experience less social support, more rejection and make them withdraw from their social life more frequently. The purpose of this research study is to show how children with craniofacial hypoplasia abnormalities is perceived by their close relatives. Material/Methods: The sample of this study consisted of 26 participants (F=16; M=10). This research study was conducted using the following questionnaire methods: the Scale of Over-Generalization Effect by K. Milska and A. Manski (SOGE), modified Own Health Assessment Scale method (SOWC) and the Authors-Designed Questionnaire (ADQ) to obtain information on the issue. Results: A child's illness always affects a variety of family life spheres. Most of the surveyed women did not experience any complication during pregnancy or childbirth. Unfortunately, after their child was diagnosed, most adults were not offered getting in contact with a psychologist / psychiatrist / psychotherapist. Some relatives - after the birth of a child with craniofacial microsomia (CFM) - reduced their working hours or gave up work completely in order to take care of the child. The most urgent needs for this child's illness reported by adults most often referred to educational and financial matters. At the time of this research study, most of the respondents (61%) - upon the birth of a child with CFM - considered it plausible to enlarge their family. Conclusions: As a result of the conducted research studies, new variable systems (a type and character of dysmorphia, closeness - distance) were identified, which may be a relevant element to facilitate research studies on the perception of children with body deformities by their environment. In the characteristics of a child with CFM, it was shown that his/her close relatives evaluate the child positively. Family members apply constructive strategies for coping with the child's illness, however, the research study results indicate the legitimacy of introduction of psychological and psychiatric consultations for close relatives to the standards of CFM child treatment.

Methods: Preoperative anxiety was assessed using Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) 1 day before surgery and on the day of surgery, and the patients were categorized as cases (APAIS score >13) and controls (APAIS score <13). Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, and fears associated with anesthesia and surgery were also noted. Results: Out of the 399 patients recruited, 58.1% experienced significant preoperative anxiety. The fear of needles (P = 0.002), fear of waking up during the surgery (P < 0.001), and the patient's need of additional information regarding anesthesia and surgery (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with preoperative anxiety. Conclusion: A significant proportion of patients scheduled for day care surgery have preoperative anxiety. A preanesthetic workup of a patient with adequate clarification about their doubts and fears related to anesthesia and surgery is recommended to bring down the level of anxiety.

Our study objectives were to validate a Hindi version of the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and to also assess the extent of perceived stress and its correlates among an adult population in an urban area of Delhi. Methodology. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban resettlement colony of Delhi among 480 adult subjects aged 25-65 years, during the period from January to December 2015. The PSS-10 was translated into Hindi and validated in the study population. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 25. Results: A total of 243 (50.6%) men and 237 (49.4%) women were enrolled. The scale had an acceptable level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.731). A principal component analysis was run on the PSS-10 data, based on which a three-component structure was accepted, which explained 61% of the total variance. The mean PSS score was 19.25 (SD = 4.50) years. Perceived stress was highest in the 35-50 age group. On multivariate analysis, low socioeconomic status and a white-collar occupation were found to be associated with increased perceived stress (P< 0.001). Conclusion: A high burden of perceived stress exists in residents of a low-income urban population in India.

This research aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cyberstalking and to analyze the coping strategies used by the victims. The data was collected from 259 secondary school students through the online inquiry, composed of a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Cyberstalking Rating Scale, and Stalking Coping Measure. Statistical analyzes revealed a real prevalence rate (experience at least one cyberstalking behavior) of 68.0 % and a self-reported victimization rate (self-identification as a victim) of 25.5%. The most frequent cyberstalking behaviors are those of hyper-intimacy; coping strategies most used by victims are strategies that involve avoiding contact or denying/minimizing stalker behaviors. The results point to a devaluation by victims of cyberstalking behaviors. We conclude the need to carry out information actions on the theme directed to the whole community, to raise awareness of this social problem, to inform about the specificities of the phenomenon, as well as to disseminate prevention strategies.

Material/Methods: Seven patients with ischemic strokes and an initial diagnosis of pure alexia were enrolled for detailed analysis. The evaluation consisted of neuropsychological assessment in the form of standardized tests and non-standardized reading tasks, while oculomotor activity during reading was measured. Language functions, visual object and space perception, verbal and nonverbal memory, and visuospatial constructional ability were among the domains assessed. Results: In five of the participants, pure alexia was recognized based on significant and specific discrepancies between test scores, indicating primary abnormalities in the visual processing of letter strings as a basic mechanism of the disorder. In most of the patients, coexisting cognitive deficits were revealed; however, these were disproportionately milder and less functionally significant than reading disturbances. Conclusions: Pure alexia is a relatively rare disorder after a stroke, but it considerably affects the quality of everyday independent functioning. Its clinical characteristics in practice rarely meet all the criteria proposed in the subject literature. The differential diagnosis of this form of alexia and other reading disorders requires detailed clinical analysis.

As part of the health protocols that seek to mitigate the pandemic's effects, school closures were implemented in most countries, where Chile was no exception. In the framework of this article, we seek to give an account of the psychosocial impact of this initiative on Chilean schools and to broaden the reflection to the rest of Latin America. In this sense, we analyze government decisions since the creation of the Aprendo en Linea [I Learn Online] program and propose a contextualization and a contrast with the measures adopted in other countries. We then explore the conditions of the exercise of the teaching activity, its consequences in the family context, and the impact on the relationship between families and schools. This allows us to visualize, once again, not only the structural inequality of the Chilean education system but also its maintenance and eventual deepening. The discussions and measures to be implemented in the current situation pose challenges that, beyond the context of Chile, can be extended to other Latin American countries.

J	Zashchirinskaia, Oksana, V								SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE COMPREHENSION OF TEXTS AND STORY PICTURES BY ADOLESCENTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISTURBANCES								ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA				18	2			221	231					2020	2020	Background: The present article addresses the peculiarities of comprehending visual stimuli by adolescents with intellectual disturbances. We have studied the ability of school students to analyse and synthesise the meaning of the text and a series of story pictures, to successively retell their content, and distinguish the main semantic constructs. Material/Methods: We examined 60 adolescents: 20 normatively developing students from secondary school, 20 students with learning disabilities and 20 children with a clinical diagnosis of "intellectual disturbances". The age of the students ranged from 15 to 19 years old (the average age was 16 years 1 month old). The age range was due to the presence of adolescents with intellectual disturbances. The examination involved 25 girls and 35 boys. The main method of research is authorial questionnaire. A small excerpt from the Russian folk tale "The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats" is used as a verbal stimulus, and Bidstrup comic cartoons - as a non-verbal stimulus. The technique of eye-tracking is used as a research method that allows registering the number of fixations, duration of gaze and length of saccades. Results: The differences in the comprehension of text and picture visual stimuli in students with different levels of intelligence have been determined. In the case of intellectual disturbances, the duration of fixations significantly increases when perceiving the texts. The level of intelligence affects the parameters of the recognition and decoding of the visual information significantly. Conclusions: It was found that the specifics of understanding texts and subject pictures by adolescents with intellectual disturbances are due to thinking passivity and different formats of information.

A convenience sample of 503 Portuguese students was evaluated, mean age of 15.92 years (SD = 1.17), 63 % female gender. Results indicate that adolescents who experience a greater number of assets tend to reveal a superior experience of positive affect and an inferior of negative affect. Data suggest the impact of subsets of Development Assets (R) on the prediction of positive and negative affect (explaining 30 and 31 % of the variance, respectively): both internal and external assets contributed to the variance in results, internal ones constitute stronger predictors. Present findings suggest the utility of the Developmental Assets (R) framework in order to understand the experience of positive and negative affect in adolescence, focusing on promoting a successful development.

J	Endres, Renata Giuliani; Sbicigo, Juliana Burges; de Salles, Jerusa Fumagalli; Bosa, Cleonice Alves								Broader Autism Phenotype and Pragmatic Abilities in Parents of Children with and without Autistic Spectrum Disorder								AVANCES EN PSICOLOGIA LATINOAMERICANA				38	2						10.12804/revistas.urosario.edu.co/apl/a.7855			2020	2020	The broader autism phenotype (BAP) has been defined as subclinical traits that configure the phenotypic expression of genetic susceptibility to the development of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The literature has pointed to the relationship between communicative-pragmatic skills and autism. However, there is controversy as to whether these skills constitute a specific feature of the BAP. Still, research with first-degree relatives of people with ASD has not yet been successful in establishing definitive markers. Thus, this study compared the performance of parents of children with (n=26) and without ASD (n=26) in communicative-pragmatic skills tasks and BAP indicators. The Broader Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) and subtests of the Montreal Communication Evaluation Battery (MAC Battery), and the Wechsler Abbreviated Intelligence Scale (WASI) were applied. The results indicated that parents of children with ASD had greater difficulty in the pragmatic language of the BAPQ, although they did not meet the criteria for BAP and in communicative-pragmatic skills of conversational speech, emotional prosody, metaphor interpretation, and indirect speech acts. The clinical group also presented a lower verbal IQ score compared to the nonclinical group. It is concluded that greater difficulties in cognitive-pragmatic skills may be a central and probably specific aspect of the BAP in family members of children with ASD, as well as difficulties in structural aspects of language, such as verbal intelligence. These results have implications for understanding the possible influence of familiar socio-cognitive factors on the genesis of autism.

This study analyses the impact that lexical representations of Spanish-speaking children in contexts of poverty have on the reading comprehension skills. Method. To this end, an assessment was made of the reading comprehension of 61 children. The results helped identify two groups within the sample: one with a high level of comprehension, and a second with a low level of comprehension. Each groups vocabulary (semantic representations of the mental lexicon) and reading level (orthographic representations of the mental lexicon) was then assessed. Other important skills related to comprehension were likewise explored, such as working memory, inference-making ability, and morphosyntactic processing of spoken language. Results. The results provide evidence regarding the substantial impact of mental lexicon representations on reading comprehension.

J	Pachalska, Maria; Goral-Polrola, Jolanta								THE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF METAPHORS IN PATIENTS AWAKENED FROM POST-TRAUMATIC COMA								ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA				18	4			437	464		10.5604/01.3001.0014.4987			2020	2020	Background: Metaphor simply is defined as a verbal construct with two referents: one literal, based on the ordinary, concrete meanings of the word or words involved, and the other metaphorical, that is one derived from an implicit analogy between the literal referent and some other phenomenon, usually an abstraction that is implied, but not named. The aim of this paper is a description of the neuropsychology of metaphors in patients awakened from post-traumatic coma. Material/Methods: A group of 34 patients awakened from post-traumatic coma and treated at the Reintegrative and Teaching Centre of the Polish Neuropsychological Society, Poland during the period 20172019 participated in this study. This group included 15 women and 17 men, with an average age of 31.2 +/- 8.72 years; as a group, the women were somewhat older (32.6 +/- 9.79 vs. 31.1 +/- 9.18). We recorded the patients' utterances with the use of video recordings of open-ended conversations, and made occasional efforts to introduce proverbs, idioms, and other metaphors into their conversation, but this was done on an impromptu basis. Results: The analysis of recordings of 100 randomly selected statements obtained from each patient revealed the presence of 4 types of errors: (1) non-comprehension, i.e. the listener's inability to comprehend the meaning of the metaphor used by the speaker, as indicated by the lack of an adequate response, an expression of puzzlement, or a question as to the meaning of the metaphor used by the speaker; (2) concretization, which occurs when the listener reacts to the literal meaning of the word, phrase, or sentence, rather than its metaphorical referent; (3) misapplication, when the speaker uses a familiar metaphor in an inappropriate context; (4) the use of incomprehensible or bizarre metaphors by the speaker, so that the intended meaning is difficult or impossible for the listener to ascertain. On many occasions, however, the gist of the metaphor emerged at some later point in the discourse, despite the surface problems. Conclusions: It was found that the TBI patients we studied showed a marked tendency in spontaneous conversation to concretize or misunderstand the metaphors used by others, and to use inappropriate or bizarre metaphors in their own speech. On many occasions, however, the gist of the metaphor emerged at some later point in the discourse, despite the surface problems.

J	Fernandes, Delfina; Albuquerque, Pedro B.; Luna, Karlos								Can Enlightenment Post-Warnings Eliminate Memory Conformity?								AVANCES EN PSICOLOGIA LATINOAMERICANA				38	3						10.12804/revistas.urosario.edu.co/apl/a.8375			2020	2020	After discussing with another witness an event, a person can incorporate new and false information in his/her own memories. That false information may appear in later accounts of the event, a phenomenon called memory conformity. The present study aimed to understand how witnesses can be protected from this false information using enlightenment post-warnings and the MORI technique. In pairs, each participant saw a different video that contained inconsistent information. Then, members of the pair discussed details of the video, and sometimes spontaneously introduced false information. Finally, half of the participants received an enlightenment post-warning, and then all participants completed a recognition test. The results showed that the discussion between witnesses impaired memory accuracy, showing the memory conformity effect. However, the enlightenment post-warnings did not reduce that effect. We conclude that the misleading information introduced by discussing with another witness has a strong influence on the memory of the event. In this way, the accounts of witnesses may contain false information difficult to get rid of, which is particularly wonying to the legal system.

Material/Methods: We tested 70 students of medicine and 70 students of dentistry. A photograph of a child with craniofacial microsomia (CFM)was shown to all the tested students. Their task was to detect and name those facial deformities and describe the child in terms of selected features not related to the child's health condition. As a tool was used the Overgeneralization Effect Scale and a questionnaire designed by the author relating to facial deformities. Results: Significant differences were observed in the level of knowledge and sensitivity to dysmorphic features between students of medicine and dentistry. Future dentists detected more dysmorphic features in the face of the photographed child when compared to students of medicine. Interestingly, this sensitivity to abnormalities was found to noticeably increase with each subsequent year of study for dentistry students, while the opposite was observed for the students of medicine. Importantly, a relationship was observed between the sensitivity to dysmorphic features and the general evaluation of the child in terms of non-medical aspects by the group of dentistry students. With the increase in the students' skills to recognize dysmorphic features, the overall evaluation of the child tended to decrease. Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that the skills related to recognizing dysmorphic features are better in students of dentistry than in students of medicine. The sensitivity to abnormalities evidently increase with each subsequent year of study for dentistry students, while the opposite was observed for medical students.

Antarctica provides one of the most hostile environments in the world for human psychophysiology and survival. The objective of this study is to identify the challenges and perspectives for research and psychological intervention in the Antarctic environment. The method was an exploratory-descriptive ethnographical study based on (a) evidence from literature related to research and psychological intervention in Antarctica and (b) an empirical qualitative study of the interaction of expeditionary members with the Antarctic environment, using interviews and a welcoming attitude of positive attention, at the beginning and end of a summer mission to Antarctica. Civilians and military personnel from two ships, as well as the Brazilian Antarctic station participated. Results: The main challenges encountered in the research include the limitations of the setting and the unpredictability of the context. The study identified that exposure to the Antarctic environment influences the emergence of interpersonal conflicts, alcohol consumption, harassment behaviors, and negative feelings of affection. Conclusion: The insertion of psychologists in Antarctica shows a concrete opportunity for research and intervention, with expected repercussions on the health and professional performance of expeditionary members.

Quality of life (QOL) is an important marker for assessing arduous treatment modalities. Diagnosis of cancer, HSCT, and the physical and psychosocial sequelae of the intensive treatment lead to a deficit in the QOL of the recipient. This study aimed to assess the impact of HSCT on psychiatric morbidity and QOL in patients with hematological malignancies. Methods: A longitudinal pre-post study was conducted at a cancer research center. Thirty patients with hematological malignancies were assessed at three different time points for psychiatric symptoms and QOL. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Comprehensive psychopathological rating scale was used to assess the psychiatric symptoms. WHO QOL Bref and cancer-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ) were used to measure the quality of life.Results: The mean (SD) age of the sample was 42.3 (12.8) years, with 24 males and 6 females. Most patients reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, reaching a peak at 3 week post-HSCT. The maximum deficit in QOL scores was seen at 3 weeks, with further improvement at 3-month post-transplant. Conclusions: HSCT leads to an increase in symptoms and a decrease in QOL during the acute phase. In the long run, it leads to improvement in physical and psychological wellbeing, with improvement in QOL. The recent surge in the long-term survivors of the procedure calls for further research in this direction so as to aid in their full recovery.

In this study, we aim to explore the predictors of domain-specific aspects of SWB in a sample of students between 12 and 18 years old in Uruguay. The Personal Wellbeing Index was used to assess the global level of sws and the scores of the seven swill domains (standard of living, health, achievements, relationships with others [peers and family], safety, community-connectedness, and future security). The Adolescent Self-Report, the National Alcohol Survey, and the Cannabis Abuse Screening Test were used to assess psychopathology, resilience, alcohol and marijuana use, respectively. Adolescents reported the highest satisfaction with the domain of community-connectedness and the least with the safety domain. Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated the existence of domain-specific determinants for the different domains of SWB. The safety domain was most influenced by the selected variables of interest, while these had a rather limited impact on the health domain. The paper discusses implications for prevention and clinical interventions in the context of schools, consultation to parents and teachers, and psychological assessment and treatment.

Records of natural interactions from eight dyads to six weeks, six months and one year of age identify the progressive constitution of the dyadic communication system. Results. The elucidation of body signs and the emergence of emotional regulation at six weeks, the interplay with social scenes at six months, and the establishment of the dyadic semantic field at one year are salient features that intertwine during the process. Triangulation with the social environment is a constant within the interaction.

Only 16% of autopsy-confirmed patients with WKS exhibit all three signs. Caine positive WKS criteria include two or more of the following: nutritional deficiency, delirium or mild memory impairment, cerebellar dysfunctionlataxia, and oculomotor abnormalities. Objective: We describe Caine positive WKS prevalence among psychiatric inpatients and compare pretreatment-versusposttreatment neurocognitive improvement to an unaffected group. Methods: This 6-month quality-improvement evaluation included two-stage screening for Caine positiveWKS, administering high-dose intravenous thiamine (day 1: 1200 mg; days 2-4: 200 mg) with reexamination on day 5. We used descriptive statistics and fitted random effects models to examine rate-of-change differences in pre-/posttreatment Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), delayed 5-item recall, and gait/coordination scores between treated Caine positive patients with WKS and untreated Caine-negative patients. Results: Of 262 patients, 32 (12%) had Caine-positive WKS; 17 (53%) used alcohol currently. Treated Caine-positive WKS (n = 26) versus Caine-negative comparison (n = 34) before and after treatment observed a mean change (standard deviation) in the MoCA score of 3.6 (2.5) versus 1.8 (2.5) (P < 0.01); 5-item recall: 1.8 (1.4) versus 0.5 (1.4) (P < 0.001); gait/coordination scores: -0.6 (1.2) versus -0.1 (0.6) (P < 0.001). Oculomotor abnormalities were infrequent (n = 4 in Caine-positive WKS, n = 2 in Caine-negative comparison groups). Conclusions: Caine-positive WKS prevalence among psychiatric inpatients was 12%; only half used alcohol. Patients treated with high-dose thiamine demonstrated clinically significant neurocognitive improvement.

Methods: During the preintervention phase, we reviewed patient-reported outcome tools and engaged stakeholders and leadership. During phase 1, the standard set was converted into an electronic previsit intake assessment that was implemented in a physician champion's practice. Patients completed the intake on a tablet, and computer adaptive testing was used to reduce response burden. Physician-facing data display facilitated use during subsequent in-person visits. An electronic version of the follow-up standard set was used during follow-up visits. During phase 2, a second physician tested scalability and the intervention was disseminated department wide in phase 3. Results: During phase 1, 186 intakes and 67 follow-up electronic patient-reported outcome sets were completed. Average patient age was 54 years, and 44% were male. On average, patients ranked the tool 4.4 out of 5 and spent 22 minutes completing the intake. Time-driven activity-based costing found the new process to be cost-effective. During phase 2, 386 patients completed electronic patient-reported outcome sets, with 315 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool as 4.0 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes completing the questions. During phase 3, 2166 patients completed intake electronic patient-reported outcome sets and 1249 follow-up visits. Patients ranked the tool 4.3 out of 5 and spent 26 minutes on it. Scores and completion time did not differ greatly between phases. Conclusions: Integration of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Depression and Anxiety Standard Set is feasible. Future research comparing International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement set with other approaches and in different settings is needed.

This meta-analysis was aimed to assess the efficacy of BLT in the treatment of SAD in adults. Method: We performed a systematic literature search including randomized, single- or double-blind clinical trials investigating BLT (>= 1,000 lx, light box or light visor) against dim light (<= 400 lx) or sham/low-density negative ion generators as placebo. Only first-period data were used from crossover trials. The primary outcome was the post-treatment depression score measured by validated scales, and the secondary outcome was the rate of response to treatment. Results: A total of 19 studies finally met our predefined inclusion criteria. BLT was superior over placebo with a standardized mean difference of -0.37 (95% CI: -0.63 to -0.12) for depression ratings (18 studies, 610 patients) and a risk ratio of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.08-1.85) for response to active treatment (16 studies, 559 patients). We found no evidence for a publication bias, but moderate heterogeneity of the studies and a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Conclusions: BLT can be regarded as an effective treatment for SAD, but the available evidence stems from methodologically heterogeneous studies with small-to-medium sample sizes, necessitating larger high-quality clinical trials.

Objective: To test the strength and reliability of cognitive (pain catastrophizing) and behavioral (limiting behaviors) pathways mediating the relationship between anxiety and postconcussion symptoms among patients with mTBI. Method: Patients with mTBI (N = 57) completed self-report measures of anxiety, postconcussion symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and limiting behavior. After preliminary simple-mediation models (for pain catastrophizing and limiting behavior separately), we ran a multiplemediation model (pathways modeled simultaneously). Bootstrapping with 10,000 resampling iterations assessed mediation reliability. Results: In preliminary simple mediation models, both pain catastrophizing (beta = 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03-0.44, P = 0.02) and limiting behaviors (beta = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03-0.26, P = 0.01) partially mediated the relationship between anxiety and postconcussion symptoms. In the multiple mediation model, pain catastrophizing was a less reliable but numerically stronger mediator (beta = 0.19, 95% CI = -0.01 to 0.38; P = 0.05) and explained more variance in postconcussion symptoms (R-2 = 0.41) than limiting behavior (beta = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.02-0.21, P = 0.03; R-2 = 0.22), although mediators did not significantly differ in strength (beta = 0.08, 95% CI = -0.16 to 0.32; P = 0.49). Results provide novel evidence for the role of pain catastrophizing and limiting behaviors in explaining the association between anxiety and postconcussion symptoms. Addressing both factors may improve the recovery trajectory of individuals with mTBI. Emphasizing limiting behavior may yield more consistent and reliable effects. Conclusion: Results support developing interventions to directly target anxiety, for pain catastrophizing, and for activity engagement despite symptoms, to decrease symptom severity among patients with mTBI.

Objective: We aimed to identify the impact of psychotropic medication use on percent total weight loss (%TWL) 1 year after bariatric surgery. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 190 patients were compared based on demographic variables (age, sex, relationship status, employment status), body mass index, %TWL, and psychotropic medication use before and 1 year after bariatric surgery. An analysis of variance test was used as a global test of significance for psychotropic medication comparisons related to %TWL. Significance of post hoc comparisons was calculated with the Tukey's Honestly Significance Difference test. Results: Sixty-one of 190 (32.1%) patients were taking psychiatric medications before surgery; of those, 82% (50/61) continued to take psychiatric medications 1-year after surgery. % TWL did not significantly differ between patients taking no psychiatric medications, one medication, or more than one medication 1 year after surgery (31.4% vs. 29.9% vs. 34.4%, respectively). Among patients taking antidepressants, those taking serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors had a significantly higher %TWL than those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (36.4% vs. 27.8%; P = 0.032). Conclusion: This longitudinal study suggests that psychiatric medication use was not associated with poorer %TWL at 1 year after bariatric surgery. Within class, antidepressant use may have differential effects on weight loss after bariatric surgery and warrants further investigation.

Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate initial rhythms and characteristics of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest among patients with SMI. Methods: We conducted a systematic chart review of adult patients who suffered from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and transferred to Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh Hospital in Japan between January 2011 and December 2017. The initial rhythms, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were compared between patients with schizophrenia or mood disorders (i.e., SMI) and nonpsychiatric control patients. Values of interest were compared using Fisher's exact test or Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Multiple regression analysis was also conducted to investigate the effect of SMI on the initial rhythms. Results: A total of 2631 patients were included in this study. Of these, 157 patients had SMI. Fatal arrhythmias (i.e., ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia) were less frequently noted as the initial rhythms among patients with SMI than among controls (5.7% vs. 18.8%, adjusted odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.13-0.55, P < 0.001). Patients with SMI were significantly younger (median [range], 58 years [22-85] vs. 72 years [18-108], P < 0.001) and less frequently had comorbid physical illnesses than controls (the proportion of patients without comorbidities; 58.6% vs. 37.1%, P < 0.001). Survival and neurological function at discharge were not different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Fatal arrhythmia may account for a relatively small portion in excess of sudden death among patients with SMI Furthermore, appropriate medical checkups for the patients with SMI at earlier ages would be important to prevent sudden cardiac death.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may offer a novel potential treatment modality for insomnia. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of tACS for treating adult patients with chronic insomnia. Methods: Sixty-two participants with chronic primary insomnia received 20 daily 40-min, 77.5-Hz, 15-mA sessions of active or sham tACS targeting the forehead and both mastoid areas in the laboratory on weekdays for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. The primary outcome was response rate measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at week 8. Secondary outcomes were remission rate, insomnia severity, sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep quality, daily disturbances, and adverse events at the end of the 4-week intervention and at the 4-week follow-up. Results: Of 62 randomized patients, 60 completed the trial. During the 4-week intervention, 1 subject per group withdrew due to loss of interest and time restriction, respectively. Based on PSQI, at 4-week follow-up, the active group had a higher response rate compared to the sham group (53.4% [16/30] vs. 16.7% [5/30], p = 0.009), but remission rates were not different between groups. At the end of the 4-week intervention, the active group had higher response and remission rates than the sham group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.026, respectively). During the trial, compared with the sham group, the active group showed a statistically significant decrease in PSQI total score, a shortened SOL, an increased TST, improved sleep efficiency, and improved sleep quality (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that, in comparison with the sham group, the active group had improved symptoms, except for daily disturbances, at the end of the 4-week intervention, and significant improvements in all symptoms at the 4-week follow-up. No adverse events or serious adverse responses occurred during the study. Conclusion: The findings show that the tACS applied in the present study has potential as an effective and safe intervention for chronic insomnia within 8 weeks.

Many primary studies publish results for only one approach, and previous meta-analyses of the algorithm approach included only a subset of primary studies that collected data and could have published results. Objective: To use an individual participant data meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of two PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithms for detecting major depression and compare accuracy between the algorithms and the standard PHQ-9 cutoff score of >= 10. Methods: Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, Web of Science (January 1, 2000, to February 7, 2015). Eligible studies that classified current major depression status using a validated diagnostic interview. Results: Data were included for 54 of 72 identified eligible studies (n participants = 16,688, n cases = 2,091). Among studies that used a semi-structured interview, pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) were 0.57 (0.49, 0.64) and 0.95 (0.94, 0.97) for the original algorithm and 0.61 (0.54, 0.68) and 0.95 (0.93, 0.96) for a modified algorithm. Algorithm sensitivity was 0.22-0.24 lower compared to fully structured interviews and 0.06-0.07 lower compared to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Specificity was similar across reference standards. For PHQ-9 cutoff of >= 10 compared to semi-structured interviews, sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) were 0.88 (0.82-0.92) and 0.86 (0.82-0.88). Conclusions: The cutoff score approach appears to be a better option than a PHQ-9 algorithm for detecting major depression.

Autoantibodies causing encephalitis directed against the neuronal cell surface or synapse are of diagnostic importance giving the possibility of successful immunotherapy. Objective: In this study, we aim to provide supporting evidence that brain 18F-FDG-PET may be helpful in identifying likely patterns of regional brain glucose metabolism. Methods: Thirty-three patients (18 men and 15 women; age range of 17-55 y) with positive NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis that underwent an 18F-FDG-PET imaging examination were prospectively selected and compared with a reference group of 14 brain 18F-FDG-PET scans from healthy volunteers using voxel-based statistical analysis. Clusters of hyper- and hypo-metabolism were reported for the whole sample of patients (FWE-corrected P < 0.05), and uncorrected at P < 0.005 for a group of relapsed patients. Results: Mixed metabolic patterns (focal 1 bilateral hypermetabolism in the temporal lobe, insula, and cerebellum; associated with severe bilateral hypometabolism in the occipital and parietal lobes) were found. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that 18F-FDG-PET should be included as an imaging tool when assessing affected patients in the clinical workup to rule out anti-NMDA encephalitis and help determine the most effective treatment.

Method: The study compared posts that market alcohol on Finnish and Swedish social media in terms of number, content, and user engagement during the month of January in three separate years: 1 year before, 1 year after, and 2 years after the 2015 Alcohol Act came into effect in Finland. The data consisted of all posts (Finland, N = 1,536; Sweden, N = 1,204) published during the selected months by alcohol brands that had active national social media accounts at the time of data collection. The coding protocol included numbers of posts and measures of consumer engagement, as well as content restricted by the law. Results: Social media posting increased between the 2014 and 2016 samples in both countries. In Finland, the number of posts decreased in 2017. The proportion of posts with content restricted by the 2015 law increased in both countries between the 2014 and 2016 samples. However, in Finland, the amount of restricted content decreased in the 2017 sample, whereas in Sweden it increased, Pearson chi(2)(1) = 29.273, p <.001. The level of user engagement increased in both countries between the 2014 and 2017 samples. Conclusions: The social media regulation in the Finnish 2015 amendment has had an impact on alcohol brands' social media content, but it has not affected marketers' ability to increase consumer engagement.

However, there is a scarcity of research on implicit processes related to marijuana use. We adapted and tested the predictive validity (concurrent and prospective) of an implicit measure evaluating the strength of associations between marijuana and harm based on research demonstrating less marijuana use among individuals who report stronger explicit attitudes of marijuana's harms. Method: A community sample of 187 U.S. young adults living in a state with legal recreational marijuana use completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) evaluating marijuana-harm associations and measures of marijuana use and risk of cannabis use disorder (CUD) over time. Results: The marijuana-harm IAT had good internal consistency, and scores did not vary as a function of biological sex, legal age status for recreational marijuana use, or college student status. Scores did vary as a function of lifetime and recent use such that lifetime and current abstainers had stronger marijuana-harm associations. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models demonstrated that marijuana-harm IAT scores significantly predicted concurrent risk of CUD and use such that stronger marijuana-harm associations were associated with less use and risk of CUD. Results evaluating outcomes longitudinally found limited support for IAT scores predicting increases in use over time and no support for predicting changes in risk of CUD over time. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary evidence that stronger marijuana-harm associations may act as a protective factor against marijuana use and risk of CUD.

J	Haden, Mark; Woods, Birgitta								LSD Overdoses: Three Case Reports								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			115	118					JAN 2020	2020	Objective: In academic settings around the world, there is a resurgence of interest in using psychedelic substances for the treatment of addictions, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and other diagnoses. This case series describes the medical consequences of accidental overdoses in three individuals. Method: Case series of information were gathered from interviews, health records, case notes, and collateral reports. Results: The first case report documents significant improvements in mood symptoms, including reductions in mania with psychotic features, following an accidental lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) overdose, changes that have been sustained for almost 20 years. The second case documents how an accidental overdose of LSD early in the first trimester of pregnancy did not negatively affect the course of the pregnancy or have any obvious teratogenic or other negative developmental effects on the child. The third report indicates that intranasal ingestion of 550 times the normal recreational dosage of LSD was not fatal and had positive effects on pain levels and subsequent morphine withdrawal. Conclusions: There appear to be unpredictable, positive sequelae that ranged from improvements in mental illness symptoms to reduction in physical pain and morphine withdrawal symptoms. Also, an LSD overdose while in early pregnancy did not appear to cause harm to the fetus.

J	Saunders, Judith P.								Women's Agency in Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children: An Evolutionary Analysis								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	1			50	62		10.1037/ebs0000169			JAN 2020	2020	One of the most notable features of Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children series is her depiction of a prehistoric environment that grants vocational, political. social, and sexual autonomy to women. Women readers have responded enthusiastically to the independence and fulfillment female characters enjoy in the Cro-Magnon communities Auel describes in Books Two through Six. Insights from evolutionary psychology help to identify strengths and weaknesses in Auel's utopian vision, showing why readers respond positively to her fiction and at the same time indicating why the female empowerment she presents could not have existed. Although she imbues her ice-age settings with scrupulously researched paleoanthropological detail, Auel's efforts to use evolutionary logic are in important respects deficient. Most glaringly, her hypothesis that men began to dominate and control women only when they become consciously aware of the male role in reproduction is based on mistaken assumptions about human behavioral adaptations. Auel's fictional representation of ice-age culture remains evolutionarily interesting, nonetheless, because it accurately locates the subordination of women in men's fitness concerns.

Alcohol Dependence and Reproductive Onset in Women, Updated: Analyses of Research and State-Level Administrative Data								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			74	80					JAN 2020	2020	Objective: The present study updates prior research, incorporating state-level administrative data to examine associations between self-reported history of alcohol dependence and birth record-derived reproductive onset, the latter assessed through peak childbearing years. Method: Participants included 542 African ancestry (AA) and 2,928 European or other ancestry (EA) female twins ascertained through Missouri birth records and recruited as part of a birth cohort study of like-sex female pairs born between 1975 and 1985. Analyses were limited to twins for whom residence in Missouri when of reproductive age could be documented, including twins who left Missouri but later returned. Cox proportional hazards regression models were estimated predicting age at first childbirth from history of alcohol dependence, separately for AA and EA twins, without and with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid psychopathology and other substance involvement, overweight/obesity status, and family-of-origin and childhood risk factors. Results: Among EA twins, alcohol dependence predicted both early and delayed childbearing; in adjusted models, alcohol dependence was associated with overall delayed childbearing. Associations between alcohol dependence and reproductive onset were nonsignificant among AA twins. Conclusions: Findings for EA twins are consistent with the broader literature indicating increased risk of teen motherhood associated with early-onset and problem drinking, but suggest that this may be explained by other correlated risk factors. The more robust finding, confirming relatively recent research, is of delayed childbearing associated with alcohol dependence.

J	Oberzaucher, Elisabeth								Antoinette Brown Blackwell-The Mother of Asymmetric Parental Investment Theory								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	1			92	99		10.1037/ebs0000180			JAN 2020	2020	The theory of asymmetric parental investment is traditionally attributed to Robert Trivers, and his publication in 1972. This publication builds strongly on the ideas published by Antoinette Brown Blackwell a century before in her book. The Sexes Throughout Nature. She sent her book to Charles Darwin, who did not recognize the potential of these ideas to lead out of some conceptual traps of the Darwinistic evolutionary theory. Trivers does not refer to Brown Blackwell, which might be due to the fact that this publication never met the recognition it would have merited. The current study addresses this issue: how would the sciences of the sexes have benefited from an earlier recognition of the concepts presented by Brown Blackwell? To what extent was research inspired by her thoughts? Would the theory on asymmetric investment have taken a different direction had science been aware of her ideas? What can science today learn from Brown Blackwell's ideas to further develop the concept of asymmetric parental investment? One major difference between Trivers and Brown Blackwell is that the latter differentiates the sexes according to their parental investment, whereas Trivers clearly attributes higher investment to women and lower investment to men. As not in all human cultures, nor in all nonhuman animal species female investment is higher. the narrative of traditional gender roles and its biological basis needs to be revisited.

J	Yiltiz, Hormet; Heeger, David J.; Landy, Michael S.								Contingent adaptation in masking and surround suppression								VISION RESEARCH				166				72	80		10.1016/j.visres.2019.11.004			JAN 2020	2020	Adaptation is the process that changes a neuron's response based on recent inputs. In the traditional model, a neuron's state of adaptation depends on the recent input to that neuron alone, whereas in a recently introduced model (Hebbian normalization), adaptation depends on the structure of neural correlated firing. In particular, increased response products between pairs of neurons leads to increased mutual suppression. We test a psychophysical prediction of this model: adaptation should depend on 2nd-order statistics of input stimuli. That is, if two stimuli excite two distinct sub-populations of neurons, then presenting those stimuli simultaneously during adaptation should strengthen mutual suppression between those subpopulations. We confirm this prediction in two experiments. In the first, pairing two gratings synchronously during adaptation (i.e., a plaid) rather than asynchronously (interleaving the two gratings in time) leads to increased effectiveness of one pattern for masking the other. In the second, pairing the gratings in a center-surround configuration results in reduced apparent contrast for the central grating when paired with the same surround (as compared with a condition in which the central grating appears with a different surround at test than during adaptation). These results are consistent with the prediction that an increase in response covariance leads to greater mutual suppression between neurons. This effect is detectable both at threshold (masking) and well above threshold (apparent contrast).

This indicates that an endogenous circadian clock regulates behavioural visual sensitivity, apart from the regulation exerted by the pineal organ. However, the specific mechanisms for cones (photopic vision) and rods (scotopic vision) are poorly understood. In this work, we performed gene expression, cosinor and immunohistochemical analyses to investigate other key genes involved in light perception, encoding the different subunits of phosphodiesterase pde6 and transducin G alpha(T), in constant lighting conditions and compared to normal light-dark conditions. We found that cones display prominent circadian oscillations in mRNA levels for the inhibitory subunit gene pde6ha that could contribute to the regulation of photopic sensitivity by preventing overstimulation in photopic conditions. In rods, the mRNA levels of the inhibitory subunit gene pde6ga oscillate under normal conditions and dampen down in constant light but continue oscillating in constant darkness. There is an increase in total relative expression for pde6gb in constant conditions. These observations, together with previous data, suggest a complex regulation of the scotopic sensitivity involving endogenous and non-endogenous components, possibly present also in other teleost species. The G alpha(T) genes do not display mRNA oscillations and therefore may not be essential for the circadian regulation of photosensitivity. In summary, our results support different regulation for the zebrafish photopic and scotopic sensitivities and suggest circadian regulation of pde6ha as a key factor regulating photopic sensitivity, while the regulatory mechanisms in rods appear to be more complex.

J	Burch, Rebecca L.								More Than Just a Pretty Face: The Overlooked Contributions of Women in Evolutionary Psychology Textbooks								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	1			100	114		10.1037/ebs0000166			JAN 2020	2020	A great deal of evolutionary psychology (EP) texts and research emphasize the attractiveness of women over other skills or qualities. I would argue that given the parameters of the evolutionary landscape, the skills and strategies women used after mating and birth (particularly because it is widely argued that almost all women have an opportunity to mate) would be more important to their evolutionary success. To only focus on youth and beauty omits major portions of the human life span and human behavior and ignores the definition of fitness: the number of offspring who survive to reproduce. To this end, I examined introductory EP textbooks for the following content: if physical attractiveness was listed as a factor in female evolutionary success, if intelligence/resourcefulness or other traits were listed as factors, if skills and strategies women use after mating and birth were discussed, and if the role of older women was mentioned. The majority of EP texts discuss female attractiveness in detail, omit female intelligence and resourcefulness, overemphasize the role of men in feeding families, and neglect older women. Overall. this gives an incomplete and biased view of the human species. I then explore what female skills and strategies would play a large role in the survival of the species and should be discussed in introductory textbooks.

Youth Exposure to Alcohol Advertising in the United States: Assessment of Two Types of Television Ratings and Implications for Voluntary Advertising Guidelines								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			34	38					JAN 2020	2020	Objective: Do youth switch channels during alcohol advertisements at different rates than adults? This question has implications for the alcohol industry's self-regulation of its advertising placements. People may avoid television advertisements by switching channels, which can be measured by comparing two television audience metrics: commercial ratings (which measure the audience during the advertisement) and program ratings (which measure the audience during the television program). We assessed changes in youth and adult audiences during alcohol advertisements with implications for alcohol industry self-regulatory compliance. Method: A census of alcohol advertisements for 2010-2014 was licensed from Nielsen (New York, NY). We compared noncompliant advertisements (with youth making up >28.4% of the audience) and the percentage decline in per capita advertising exposure for youth and adult age groups using both commercial and program ratings. Results: The audience during the alcohol advertisement declined by 8.48% among underage viewers ages 12-17 years and by 7.04% for viewers ages 18-20 years, compared with 8.20% for adults ages 21-24, 10.43% for ages 25-34, and 9.74% for ages 35 and older. These declines exceeded the margin of error (+/- 2.6%), indicating a decline in viewership across all age groups, but we could not draw conclusions about differences between age groups. Compared with audience estimates using commercial ratings, program ratings underestimated the number of noncompliant advertisements by 8,800, leading to an underestimate of noncompliant exposure by 140 million impressions. Conclusions: Both underage viewers and young adults switched channels during alcohol advertisements. Using commercial ratings rather than program ratings may more accurately measure compliance with alcohol industry advertising guidelines.

Investigation of the Gut Microbiome in Patients with Schizophrenia and Clozapine-Induced Weight Gain: Protocol and Clinical Characteristics of First Patient Cohorts								NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY				79	1			5	12		10.1159/000494696			JAN 2020	2020	Background: Emerging evidence suggests an important role of the human gut microbiome in psychiatry and neurodevelopmental disorders. An increasing body of literature based on animal studies has reported that the gut microbiome influences brain development and behavior by interacting with the gut-brain axis. Furthermore, as the gut microbiome has an important role in metabolism and is known to interact with pharmaceuticals, recent evidence suggests a role for the microbiome in antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects in animals and humans. Purpose: Here we present the protocol for a two-phase study investigating the gut microbiome in healthy controls and in patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics. Methods: Phase I of our study involves humans exclusively. We recruit 25 patients who are chronically treated with clozapine and compare them with 25 healthy controls matched for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. A second cohort consists of 25 patients newly starting on clozapine, and a third cohort includes 25 antipsychotic-naive patients. The patients in the second cohort and third cohort are prospectively assessed for up to 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Phase II of this study will incorporate microbiota humanized mouse models to examine the influence of human fecal transplant on metabolic parameters and the gut-brain axis. Progress and Future Directions: We are underway with the first participants enrolled in all phase I treatment cohorts. This study will contribute to elucidating the role of the gut microbiome in schizophrenia and metabolic side effects. In addition, its results may help to explore potential therapeutic targets for antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects.		[Gorbovskaya, Ilona; Kanji, Sarah; Liu, Jonathan C.

Here we utilize this novel as a unique and abundant case study to generate a broader theoretical discussion of feminism and evolutionary psychology. Integrating the function of fiction (Carroll. 2018), we highlight examples in the novel which illustrate the overt and covert attempts by both sexes to control female sexuality and reproductive potential. Examples from the novel are utilized to discuss myriad behaviors underlying the divergent reproductive interest of men and women, and female-female competition that occurs under patriarchal control. Implicit and explicit tactics women use to resist control over their sexuality are outlined, and we argue that the sensitivity to the structure of a society such as (the fictionalized) Republic of Gilead is only possible via evolved cognitive mechanisms that allow humans to detect attempts to exercise power and control over reproductive choices. We present evidence that evolved emotional and motivational systems incentivize feminists today to prevent such a society, and that feminism itself is only possible as a social, political, and intellectual movement based on those evolved cognitive mechanisms.

The purposes of this study were to characterize the alcohol policy environment in each U.S. state and Washington, DC, in 2018, and to examine changes during the past 20 years. Method: State-specific Alcohol Policy Scale (APS) scores from 1999 to 2018 were based on 29 policies, after weighting each present policy by its efficacy and degree of implementation. Modified APS scores were also calculated on the basis of two sets of mutually exclusive policy subgroups. Results: APS scores in 2018 varied considerably between states, ranging from 25.6 to 67.9 on a theoretical scale of 0 to 100; the median score was 43.5 (based on a 0-100 range), and 43 states had scores less than 50. The median change in state APS scores from 1999 to 2018 was positive (+4.9, range: -7.4 to +10.3), indicating increases in the restrictiveness of policy environments, with decreases in only five states. The increases in APS scores were primarily attributable to the implementation of stronger impaired-driving laws, whereas policies to reduce excessive drinking were unchanged. There was no correlation between states' excessivedrinking policy scores and their impaired-driving scores (r =.05, p =.74). Conclusions: Based on this policy scale, few states have restrictive policy environments. Although states adopted policies targeting impaired driving during the study period, there was no change in policies to reduce excessive drinking.

J	Lin, Gregory; Taylor, Christopher; Rucker, Frances								Effect of duration, and temporal modulation, of monochromatic light on emmetropization in chicks								VISION RESEARCH				166				12	19		10.1016/j.visres.2019.11.002			JAN 2020	2020	Previous experiments disagree on the effect of monochromatic light on emmetropization. Some species respond to wavelength defocus created by longitudinal chromatic aberration and become more myopic in monochromatic red light and more hyperopic in monochromatic blue light, while other species do not. Using the chicken model, we studied the effect of the duration of light exposure, modes of lighting, and circadian interruption on emmetropization in monochromatic light. To achieve this goal, we exposed one-week-old chicks to flickering or steady monochromatic red or blue light for a short (10 days) or long (17 days) duration; other chicks were exposed to white light for 10 days. Refraction and ocular biometry were measured. Activity was measured via a motion detection algorithm and an IR camera. The results showed that in both steady and flickering light, there was a greater increase in axial length and vitreous chamber depth in chicks exposed to red or white light compared to chicks exposed to blue light. With a longer duration of exposure, axial length and vitreous chamber depth differences were no longer observed, except at an intermediate time point. Chicks exposed to red light were more active during the day compared to chicks exposed to blue light. We conclude that our results indicate that with short duration monochromatic light exposure, chicks rely on wavelength defocus to guide emmetropization. With longer exposure from hatching, our results support the notion that responses to wavelength defocus can be transient and that the difference between species may be due to differences in experimental duration and/or interference with circadian activity rhythms.

Stereoscopic depth adaptation from binocularly correlated versus anti-correlated noise: Test of an efficient coding theory of stereopsis								VISION RESEARCH				166				60	71		10.1016/j.visres.2019.10.009			JAN 2020	2020	Stereoscopic, or "3D" vision in humans is mediated by neurons sensitive to the disparities in the positions of objects in the two eyes' views. A disparity-sensitive neuron is typically characterized by its responses to left- and right-eye monocular signals, S-L and S-R, respectively. However, it can alternatively be characterized by sensitivity to the sum of the two eyes' inputs, S+ = S-L + S-R, and the difference, S- = S-L - S-R. Li and Atick's theory of efficient binocular encoding proposes that the S+ and S- signals can be separately weighted to maximize the efficiency with which binocular information is encoded. This adaptation changes each neuron's sensitivity and preferred binocular disparity, resulting in predicted effects on the perceived stereoscopic depth of objects. To test these predictions, we measured the apparent depth of a random-dot stereogram with an 'in-front' target following adaptation to binocularly correlated or anti-correlated horizontally-oriented grating stimuli, which reduce sensitivity to the S+ and S- signals, respectively, but which contain no conventional stereo-depth signals. The anti-correlated noise adaptation made the target appear relatively closer to the background than the correlated noise adaptation, with differences of up to 60%. We show how this finding can be accommodated by a standard model of binocular disparity processing, modified to incorporate the binocular adaptation suggested by Li and Atick's theory.

Attentional blink (AB) studies using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms have shown that when two targets (Ti and T2) are successively presented within 400 msec, T2 performance is significantly impaired (i.e., an AB effect). Some object-based AB studies have indicated that the stable representation of single objects before Tl reduced the same-object AB effect, and some have claimed that the inhibition of the global objects representation by Ti processing enhanced the same-object AB effect. However, these studies did not directly explore whether and how the object representation modulated the object-based AB effect. In the present study, we used a hybrid of the RSVP and double-rectangle paradigms to address this issue. The results revealed that when the object representation was inhibited by Ti processing, the AB effect spread across the object groupings showing an enhanced same-object AB effect; when the object representation was created before T1 processing, there was a reliably reduced same-object AB effect that was not mediated by OBA (i.e., no difference in T2 performance between the same and different objects). Additionally, a horizontal configuration benefit independent of OBA was obtained in the AB.

J	Ingalls, Victoria								Who Creates Warrior Women? An Investigation of the Warrior Characteristics of Fictional Female Heroes Based on the Sex of the Author								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	1			79	91		10.1037/ebs0000176			JAN 2020	2020	Previous research has found that the sex of the author can influence the characteristics of their fictional hero and that these differences can be predicted using evolutionary psychology. According to sexual selection theory, males and females evolve different behavioral strategies, and thus different psychologies, in order to maximize reproductive success; thus, humans will have behavioral tendencies influenced by subconscious mechanisms that would have aided fitness in the ancestral environment. This study focuses on how the characteristics of the female hero may differ based on the sex of the author using 30 fantasy series written for children ages 10-17. Male authors are predicted to create female heroes who are more physically powerful and more likely to engage in physical conflicts than female authors, because males benefit more than females from physical battle. Although not all comparisons produced statistically significant differences, all data produced trends in the predicted directions. A closer analysis found that female authors created female heroes who were more likely to be human girls without superhuman abilities, while males created female heroes who were unlikely to be fully human. When examining male-female hero teams, it was found that female authors tended to make the male hero more powerful than his female teammate, which was not true for male authors. This may be because females benefit when their mate can dominate other males. These results suggest that males and females create different traits in their heroes. irrespective of the hero's sex, and that female-created heroes achieve their goals without resorting to physical violence.

Identifying moderators of this relationship will aid the development of effective interventions for this at-risk group. This cross-sectional study examined whether anticipated social outcomes and controlled drinking self-efficacy moderated the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol outcomes. Method: A total of 385 participants (drinkers and nondrinkers; mean age = 20.98, SD = 2.35; 65% female; 81% born in Australia), completed an online survey measuring alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harms, social anxiety, anticipated social outcomes, and controlled drinking self-efficacy. Regressions examined the interactive effects of social anxiety, anticipated social outcomes, and controlled drinking self-efficacy on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms. Results: A significant three-way interaction was found for alcohol consumption (95% CI [-0.523, -0.018]). Simple slopes revealed an inverse relationship between social anxiety and alcohol consumption when participants anticipated positive evaluations for being drunk and had high controlled drinking self-efficacy (95% CI [-1.181, -0.273]). The three-way interaction for alcohol-related harms was not significant (95% CI [-1.445, 0.799]). A significant two-way interaction revealed that the relationship between social anxiety and alcohol-related harms was only significant when individuals had low (95% CI [0.571, 3.943]), but not high (95% CI [-1.149, 0.735]), controlled drinking self-efficacy. Conclusions: Social anxiety was associated with reduced alcohol consumption when young people anticipated positive evaluations for being drunk and had high confidence to control their drinking. Further, social anxiety was associated with alcohol-related harms when young people had low confidence to control their drinking.

Previous studies reported on the effect of luminance contrast on the reading-speed function, that is, the relationship between reading speed and character size. In particular, when contrast was reduced, the critical print size (CPS) was found to shift to a larger character size even though the maximum reading speed and function shape did not change [Japanese Journal of Ophthalmology 52(1) (2008) 44-47]. In the present study, the effect of luminance contrast on the reading function was quantitatively examined. Japanese phrases with a luminance contrast of 0.03-0.99 were prepared as stimuli. Observers with normal vision were asked to read aloud phrases with several character sizes. Then, the reading functions were obtained for each luminance contrast. CPS was found to increase as the luminance contrast decreased. The relationship between contrast and CPS was linear in log-log coordinates, that is, log-CPS increased as the log-contrast of the characters decreased. It was found that the contrast of the stimulus systematically affects the location of the reading function.

A strategy to examine the role of the microbiome in different diseases is the intake of supplements that modulate the gut microbiome. Despite promising results in animal studies, research in humans is sparse to date and especially in individuals with psychiatric disorders almost missing. The current report of the ProbioBIP-one pilot study aims at describing general effects of the intake of the probiotic OMNi-BiOTiC Stress repair (R) on psychological parameters as well as gastrointestinal symptoms and general compliance in a cohort of euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), receiving daily probiotic treatment over a time period of 3 months. Twenty-seven individuals with BD took part in the present study (mean age = 50.7 years, SD = 12.2; females 40.7%). In sum, there was a high compliance rate with 81.5% of the study participants completing all 3 study visits and 85% of planned probiotic ingestions taken. Gastrointestinal problems were prevalent in more than half of the patients at the time of inclusion (t1). Expectedly, in the whole cohort, a high proportion of study participants experienced changes concerning digestion during probiotic treatment, around one third reported positive changes (reduced flatulence and easier and more frequent bowel movements) after 1 month (t2) and further after 3 months (t3). In contrast, a smaller part of study participants reported gastrointestinal discomfort after 1 and after 3 months (mainly flatulence and obstipation). We found a significantly reduced cognitive reactivity to sad mood between t2 and t3 indicating that participants under probiotic supplementation perceived themselves to be less distracted by ruminative thoughts. Further changes in psychiatric symptoms were small due to the euthymic state and already low scoring at the time of inclusion. Nevertheless, we found a significant symptom reduction in the rating scales measuring manic symptoms. From a clinical point of view, probiotic supplementation might provide a well-tolerated tool to positively influence gastrointestinal quality of life as well as mental and somatic health, cognition and immune response and potentially have effects on psychiatric symptoms.

The Prospective Association of Negative Urgency With Hazardous Drinking Via Impaired Control: A Moderating Role of Alcohol Sensitivity								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			89	94		10.15288/jsad.2020.81.89			JAN 2020	2020	Objective: Trait negative urgency is consistently associated with alcohol problems, and cross-sectional findings have suggested a mediational role of impaired control over alcohol. Initial evidence also suggests that individual differences in self-reported sensitivity to alcohol's effects may moderate the association between urgency and alcohol outcomes. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend these findings using prospective data. Method: Young adult drinkers (N = 159, mean age = 18.87, SD = 1.16; 70.4% female) from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, completed an online survey at baseline and again 6 months later. Participants completed questionnaires measuring negative urgency, alcohol sensitivity, impaired control over alcohol, and hazardous drinking. Results: Moderated mediation analyses revealed that the prospective indirect association between negative urgency at baseline and hazardous drinking at follow-up (mediated via increased impaired control at follow-up) was significant only for young adults who reported relatively lower alcohol sensitivity at baseline. Conclusions: Using prospective data from a unique sample of young adults, the present study partially replicates prior cross-sectional findings suggesting that the indirect association between urgency and hazardous drinking via impaired control over alcohol is moderated by alcohol sensitivity.

Shape partitioning interacts with global shape integration								VISION RESEARCH				166				20	32		10.1016/j.visres.2019.11.005			JAN 2020	2020	Objects are often identified by the shape of their profiles but complex objects are often comprised of multiple articulated components. It has been proposed that complex objects are decomposed and recognized by their component parts. This study exploits the proposition that the visual system decomposes objects at matched deep concavities on their boundaries. Rapid decreases in thresholds for detection of sinusoidal deformation of a circle's radius with number of cycles of modulation shows that shape information is integrated around radial frequency (RF) patterns. Here we merge RF patterns to form composite patterns with concavities and show that integration around the RF patterns is disrupted if the concavities are shallow but preserved if they are deep, consistent with their decomposition at matched deep concavities. Geon theory identifies complex patterns through a structural description of viewpoint invariant primitives known as geons. Geons are defined by properties on their boundaries that co-occur in a non-accidental manner across viewpoint changes rather than by reconciling metric properties such as curvature with viewpoint specific templates. Similarly, shapes of RF patterns are defined by the positions of curvature features on their boundaries. We argue that RF patterns provide flexible stimuli that might be used to study geons.

J	Douglass, Melanie Dawn; D' Aguanno, Sofia; Jones, Sophie								Women as Active Agents: Female Perpetrators of Sexual Harassment and Domestic Abuse								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	1			32	49		10.1037/ebs0000171			JAN 2020	2020	Beginning with Darwin's theory of sexual selection, evolutionary psychology has been dominated by the view that females are the "choosy sex" and, through intrasexual competition, males the "aggressive sex." This view was supported by seminal works (e.g., Buss et al., 1990; Clark & Hatfield. 1989) that foliated the basis of a considerable body of work. Moreover, they lent credence to the popular view that women ate less interested in the sexual side of human relationships, instead being focused on protection and stability. Combined with the notion that males an: the dominant/aggressive sex, the literature has therefore insufficiently examined female aggression. When female aggression does occur, it is often viewed as a retaliation against male aggression (i.e., self-defense), raffier than an as active strategy used by a small but not insignificant proportion of women. The focus on male aggression and female self-defense not only deprives women of agency but also means that their victims are not taken as seriously, and rehabilitation programs for female offenders are scarce. This article will discuss evidence that women act aggressively. focusing on why and when women engage in sexual harassment and domestic abuse. It will seek to establish the underlying mechanisms for such strategies (e.g., the personality traits associated with increased aggression in women), which future research should explore. Moreover, because, historically. the evolutionary literature has taken a heteronormative approach, female aggression will be examined in the context of diverse human relationships.

An Examination of Opioid Deaths in Delaware, 2013-2017								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			68	73		10.15288/jsad.2020.81.68			JAN 2020	2020	Objective: Drug overdoses among men have historically outnumbered those among women by a large margin. Yet, U.S. research on the first wave of the opioid epidemic involving prescription opioids has found women to be at increased risk. The current study considers if the narrowing gender gap in overdose deaths, as observed during the first wave, has continued into the most recent third wave, dominated by synthetic opioid deaths. This requires consideration of interactions between gender, age, and type of drug implicated. Method: Drawing on 2013-2017 Delaware toxicology reports for a total of 890 overdose deaths involving opioids, we distinguished between four gender/age groups-women 15-44, women 45-64, men 15-44, and men 45-64-to calculate crude death rates, male-to-female death rate ratios, and younger-to-older death rate ratios by type of opioid. Results: Opioid overdose death rates during the third wave increased among both men (+102%) and women (+46%), but the larger increase among men resulted in an increase in the male-to-female death rate ratio (from 1.9 to 2.6). This trend was driven by the growing contribution of fentanyl (from 16% to 76%) and heroin overdose deaths (from 27% to 50%) compared with other opioid overdose deaths, which disproportionately affected men and younger individuals. Higher male-to-female death rate ratios were observed among older, compared with younger, individuals. Conclusions: Overdose deaths seem to have returned to a historically familiar pattern of dominance by younger males. Our findings suggest the gender-age distribution in deaths to specific opioid types must be considered for effective intervention.		[Eeckhaut, Mieke C.

The Violence Prevention Potential of Reducing Alcohol Outlet Access in Baltimore, Maryland								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			24	33					JAN 2020	2020	Objective: There are few cost-effectiveness analyses that model alcohol outlet zoning policies. This study determines the potential decreases in homicides, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and victim and criminal justice costs associated with four policy options that would reduce the alcohol outlet access in Baltimore. Method: This cost-effectiveness analysis used associations between on-premise (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.41), off-premise (IRR = 1.76), and combined on- and off-premise outlet density (IRR = 1.07) and homicide in Baltimore. We determined the potential change in the level of homicide that could occur with changes in the density of alcohol outlets, assuming that 50% of the association was causal. Results: Reducing alcohol outlet density in Baltimore City by one quintile was associated with decreases of 51 homicides per year, $63.7 million, and 764 DALYs. Removing liquor stores in residential zones was associated with 22 fewer homicides, which would cost $27.5 million and lead to 391 DALYs. Removing bars/taverns operating as liquor stores was associated with a decrease of one homicide, $1.2 million, and 17 DALYs. Removing both the liquor stores in residential zones and the bars/taverns operating as liquor stores was associated with 23 fewer homicides, which translated to $28.7 million and 409 DALYs. Conclusions: For preventing homicides, the strategy of removing liquor stores in residential zones was preferred because it was associated with substantial reductions in homicides without closing unacceptably high numbers of outlets. It is possible that policies that close the bars/taverns operating as liquor stores would be associated with decreases in other types of violent crime.

J	Eichelberger, Angela H.; Kelley-Baker, Tara								Measuring Drug Use Among Drivers: How Accurate Is Self-Reported Use?								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			104	114					JAN 2020	2020	Objective: There has been considerable work validating self-reported drug use with bioassays, but these studies have not been conducted with respondents on the roadway. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of drivers' self-reported drug use. Method: This study analyzed 2007 and 2013-2014 data from nationally representative roadside surveys of U.S. drivers. Using phi coefficients, the study examined the association between self-reported, past-24-hour drug use and bioassays (based on oral fluid and/or blood) for cannabis, opioids, cocaine, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines. Logistic regression models examined the association of various factors with the odds of reporting specific drug types. Results: Overall phi coefficients by drug type ranged from .17 to .34 in 2007 and .30 to .54 in 2013-2014. The odds of reporting cannabis, cocaine, and benzodiazepine use were significantly higher among drivers who used these substances in 2013-2014 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92, 2.97, and 3.25, respectively), compared with 2007. Opioid and antidepressant reporting did not differ significantly among users of these substances across survey years (OR = 1.01 and OR = 1.44, respectively). Conclusions: Roadside surveys of drivers are an important method for gathering the types of data needed to monitor trends in drug use. The findings reinforce the importance of gathering multiple types of data to understand drug use among drivers. The many factors that influence self-reporting, as well as the limitations of biological measures, both pose challenges to accurately measuring drug use. Future studies should investigate ways to improve measurement of drug use in this population.

To date, the presence and nature of women's sexually exploitative strategies has not been empirically tested. Replicating the procedure adopted by Goetz. Easton. Lewis, and Buss (2012) using a male-only sample. we examine the relationship between sexual exploitability and attractiveness in a female-only sample. Women (N = 151; 83% White; M-age = 22 years) rated photographs of men displaying various levels of exploitability cues, and then completed the Components of Mate Value Survey and the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory. As found in men, women similarly use cues of incapacitation and manipulability to infer sexual exploitability. However, unlike men, only some of these manipulability cues (those indicating that the man is easily seduced; e.g.. flirty, having promiscuous friends) were associated with short-term attractiveness. For women, cues of genetic fitness (e.g., intelligent, facial attractiveness) were associated with short-term attractiveness. Although mate value did not affect these relationships, the relationship between perceived exploitability and short-term attractiveness did depend on sociosexuality. Sexually exploitable targets were perceived as more attractive short-term mates for sexually unrestricted. compared with sexually restricted, women.

Even more, after symptom remission, many individuals with BD experience persisting cognitive impairment also in euthymic periods, leading to high illness burden and low quality of life. According to a recent research in animals and healthy humans, microbiota may influence cognitive processes via the brain-gut axis. A strategy to examine the role of the microbiota in different diseases is the intake of supplements that modulate the gut microbiome. The aim of this pilot study was to analyze the impact of probiotic supplements on cognitive parameters in a cohort of euthymic individuals with BD, receiving daily probiotic treatment over a time period of 3 months. Methods: A total of 20 euthymic individuals with BD received probiotic supplement over a time period of 3 months and completed a cognitive test battery at 3 time points (t1 at time of inclusion, t2 after one month and t3 after 3 months of probiotic intake). Results: We found a significant improvement of performance concerning attention and psychomotor processing speed measured with the Digit Symbol Test after one (t2) as well as after 3 months (t3) of treatment (F = 8.60; eta(2) = 0.49, p < 0.01). Furthermore, executive function measured with the TMT-B, increased significantly over 3 months (F = 3.68; eta(2) = 0.29, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results confirm the hypotheses that probiotic supplement might help stable individuals with BD to improve the cognitive function, which in turn might lead to better psychosocial, occupational, work and financial functioning. Nevertheless, the idea of this potential new treatment is challenging because of the variety of the human's gut microbiota.

J	Volk, Anthony A.; Franklin, Prarthana								When Is the Breast Best? Infant Feeding as a Domain of Intrasexual Competition								EVOLUTIONARY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES				14	1			6	18		10.1037/ebs0000167			JAN 2020	2020	Medical science is unanimous in stating the numerous and significant benefits (to child and mother) of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is free and is biologically plausible for most mothers. Yet a significant percentage of mothers do not breastfeed their infants. Feminist theorists have aligned themselves on both sides of this issue (as well as the fence in between). Some view breastfeeding as an inherently natural and empowering aspect of femininity. Others view it as a means of suppressing women's choices and belittling their contributions. We suggest that one reason for this controversy is that breastfeeding may be about more than just providing nutrition to one's infant. Breastfeeding may also represent a domain of female intrasexual competition. We review evidence from modem developed and developing countries, historical countries, and hunter-gatherer cultures and find it consistent with our hypothesis. Specifically, wealthy women in developed countries tend to have fewer children yet flaunt their breastfeeding as a display of their resources whereas wealthy women in developing/ historical countries tend to demonstrate their resources by focusing on having more children and avoiding breastfeeding. We therefore find support for breastfeeding as an intrasexual domain for signaling one's social status and resources. Given this variation in breastfeeding practices, we argue that breastfeeding is an agentic expression of women's proximate and evolved psychological decisions and advocate for providing supports that allow women to freely make the best decisions for themselves.

Twenty healthy young adults read fourteen 2-min passages designed with fourteen different color combinations between text and background, while the accommodative and pupil responses were continuously measured with a binocular open-field autorefractometer. Our results revealed that the text-background color combination modulates the accommodative and pupillary dynamics during a 2-minutes reading task. The blue-red combination induced a heightened accommodative response, whereas positive polarities were associated with more variability of the accommodative response and smaller pupil sizes. Participants reported lower perceived ratings of legibility for text-background color combination with lower luminance contrast (white-yellow). The manipulation of text-background color did not have a significant effect on reading speed. These results may have important applications in the design of digital visual interfaces.

Policy Influencer and General Public Support for Proposed Alcohol Healthy Public Policy Options in Alberta and Quebec, Canada								JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS				81	1			47	57					JAN 2020	2020	Objective: Although alcohol consumption is considered a major modifiable risk factor for chronic disease, policies to reduce alcohol-related harm remain low on the Canadian policy agenda. The objective of this study was to understand support for population-level healthy public policies to reduce alcohol-related harm by assessing the attitudes of policy influencers and the public in two Canadian provinces, and by sociodemographic characteristics. Method: A stratified sample of the general public (n = 2,400) and a census sample of policy influencers (n = 302) in Alberta and Quebec participated in the 2016 Chronic Disease Prevention Survey, which included questions to assess support for alcohol-specific policies. Differences in levels of support were determined by calculating differences in the proportion of support for alcohol control policies, comparing groups by regional and sociodemographic characteristics. The modified Nuffield Council on Bioethics Intervention Ladder was used to assess support according to the level of individual intrusiveness. Results: We found that policy influencers and general public respondents were supportive of both information-based policies, with the exception of warning labels, and more restrictive policies targeting youth (e.g., enforcement). Both groups were less favorable to alcohol-specific policies that guided choice through disincentives (e.g., taxation). There were more differences in policy support by sociodemographic characteristics among the public. Conclusions: For health advocates to advance policies to reduce alcohol-related harms at the population level, they will need to mobilize additional support for more intrusive, yet more effective, policy interventions. Advocacy efforts should focus on communicating the effectiveness and positive outcomes of these interventions to help garner support.

For schizophrenia, a motor cortical inhibitory deficit has been established as one aspect of impaired plasticity, especially involving impairments in GABAergic interneuron networks, but the possibility to restore these deficits via exercise-induced plasticity has not been evaluated yet. Methods: 17 schizophrenia patients and 16 matched healthy controls underwent 3 months of aerobic endurance training (30 min, 3 times a week) on bicycle ergometers. After 6 weeks, computer-assisted cognitive remediation training (30 min, 2 times a week) was added. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left and right hemispheres was performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. We evaluated the intensity to induce a motor-evoked potential of 1 mV (S1mV), the resting motor threshold (RMT), the cortical silent period (CSP) at an intensity of 120 and 150% of the individual RMT, short-latency interval intracortical inhibition (3 ms), and intracortical facilitation (7 and 15 ms). Depending on the variable and hemisphere, follow-up data was available for 7-15 schizophrenia patients and for 10-12 healthy controls. Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant time x group interactions for any of the analyzed variables. A significant increase in S1mV and CSP duration at 150% RMT of the left hemisphere could be observed in both groups over time. Conclusion: Regular ergometer training over 3 months increases motor cortical inhibition as displayed by an increase in CSP. The increase in S1mV may also indicate a higher degree of inhibition after the intervention. We could not establish a difference between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Due to the limited sample size, our results have to be considered as preliminary and need to be replicated in future trials.
