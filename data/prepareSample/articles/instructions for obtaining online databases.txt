Instructions: 

1. We used the Web of Science advanced search tool (https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/advanced-search) to search the databases included in the Core Collection, specifically, the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI).

2. Institutional access and login via ORCID was required. 

3. We searched for records published in 2020 that had been categorised as belonging to the field of psychology and had a document type classification of 'article', 'discussion', 'editorial material', or 'letter'. This search returned 61,735 records. The specific search string was:

WC=(Psychology OR Psychology, Applied OR Psychology, Biological OR Psychology, Clinical OR Psychology, Developmental OR Psychology, Educational OR Psychology, Experimental OR Psychology, Mathematical OR Psychology, Multidisciplinary OR Psychology, Psychoanalysis OR Psychology, Social) AND DT=(Article OR Discussion OR Editorial Material OR Letter)

We also applied a date range filter using a publication date range of 2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31.

4. We used the 'Fast5000' feature to export the records output by the search. The maximum number of records that can be export is 5000 at a time. Thus, it was necessary perform 12 exports to download all 61,735 records. This resulted in the 12 files titled **savedrecs.txt (where ** ranges from 00 to 12). The files were downloaded on April 19, 2023. 

5. The content of the **savedrecs.txt files was copied and pasted into a csv file - WoS2020Article_List.csv - with headers removed (aside from the first header).
